Bill Gates would be buying land from small farmers to monopolize the food supply and not to save the planet 

 Bill Gates is being accused of trying to control the country’s food supply by backing moves that would bankrupt small independent farmers and then acquire large portions of their land.

This, according to statements by author Seamus Bruner in his recently published book “Controligarchs”.

Bruner’s new book argues that Gates is getting rich leading an effort to transform traditional agriculture under the excuse of saving the planet.

The accusations

A chapter on “war against farmers” details how Gates and other tech industry moguls seek to take control of the country’s food supply to increase their wealth.

The Microsoft co-founder has supported removing traditional nutrients and fertilizers for crops “after obtaining the intellectual property for fertilizer replacements,” Bruner stated.

Furthermore, he accused Gates of attacking the fertilizer industry for years, while simultaneously acquiring large tracts of American farmland.

Agricultural restrictions and more expensive fertilizers have driven some independent farmers out of business.

Furthermore, the tycoon has invested in Upside Foodsa company that develops lab-grown meats and touts itself as the first to receive FDA approval for synthetic meat.

Gates, who said methane emissions from cows are a big contributor to climate change, has also invested in other companies creating synthetic food alternatives, including Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.

These companies hold numerous product patents and dozens pending.

In 2021, Gates He said: “I think all rich countries should completely switch to synthetic meat. One can adapt to the taste and it is said that over time it will taste even better. “Over time, the additional cost will be minimal and people’s behavior could be changed through regulations.”

It is reported that the co-founder of Microsoft has acquired hundreds of thousands of acres of American farmland, raising concerns. When asked about it earlier this year, he responded:

“I own less than 1/4000 of the farmland in the U.S. I have invested in these farms to increase their productivity and create more jobs. There is no grand plan behind it; in fact, all of these decisions are made by a professional investment team.”

Bruner maintains that Gates is not only buying land, but also groundwater rights.

“In addition to acquiring land (and irrigation rights) and fertilizers, Gates has been pursuing significant interests in water and water treatment, aspects crucial to controlling the agricultural industry,” he argues.

Bruner mentioned to Fox News Digital:

“First there were patented seeds and fertilizers, now they are patenting alternatives to meat. Banning livestock farming would give effective monopolies to alternative protein companies, benefiting investors like Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and even BlackRock. Substitute meats serve to control the food market, not to save the planet.”

As expected, the Gates Foundation has not responded on this issue.
