With this one simple act, Russia could forever secure its territorial gains in Ukraine 

 By now the world is all too depressingly familiar with Russian military doctrine, which permits the use of nuclear weapons against "large-scale aggression utilizing conventional weapons in situations critical to the national security of the Russian Federation.” This barbaric philosophy of war means that

Vladimir Putin could simply announce Russia's annexation of its territorial gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, thus making the regions part of the Russian Federation. And should Ukraine persist in retaking those territories — see: Russian military doctrine. That Putin intends to legalize such an official, illegal land grab is "likely" within the next few months, writes the Institute for the Study of War. He would then quickly follow up with an announcement, either vague or specific, that the territories shall if necessary be defended by nuclear weapons. 

This verbal gambit has so far intimidated the West into proceeding with extreme caution in its military assistance to Ukraine. Russian annexation could potentially convert caution into inertia. Which means Ukraine, with the West's military support, must act with the greatest urgency. Because for Putin, the matter of annexation is a question of timing. If he foresees additional territorial gains in eastern and southern Ukraine, he will postpone annexation, opting for the largest land grab possible. (This is the most likely of likelihoods.) But if he suspects his military is on the brink of collapse, or hopelessly stalemated, or gradually losing Ukrainian ground, that's when he would "officially" incorporate the territories he has into the Federation. 

Negotiations would become moot. Ukraine and the West would then face an awful dilemma: concede Russia's grossly illicit acquisitions, or risk a nuclear confrontation. Since both prospects are unacceptable to both non-Russian parties, only the third option of a massive Ukrainian counteroffensive is to be entertained. Russia's ground gains, east and south, must be erased, and they must be erased swiftly. As with Putin's decision on annexation, the timing of a Ukrainian counter-push is paramount; it must be executed before Russia can organize administrative centers in misappropriated territories and declare them parts of the Federation. 

Annexation of such a broad swath of Ukrainian ground — from its southeast, its Azov Sea access, and all the way along its Black Sea coastline — would almost certainly suffocate the very existence of a Ukrainian state. Much of its agricultural ground and all of its sea-export access would be lost, its economy permanently ruptured, its national finances devastated. Moreover, millions of its citizens would be captives of a Stalinesque occupier — the stolen Ukrainian ground would become a kind of huge Gaza Strip. All of which means just one thing. 

The West must immediately saturate Ukraine with the heaviest of armaments it can supply — which is one helluva lot; helicopters, armored personnel vehicles, tanks, and especially artillery. Every fighter jet the West can scrape up is strongly advised as well. Ukraine is indisputably capable of winning this war outright, and soon, if the West adequately supplies it and Ukraine immediately commences a counteroffensive in the lands Russia aims to illegally incorporate. 

But of course an overwhelming offensive is impossible without overwhelming war matériel. The decision is the West's: either accept Vladimir Putin's barbarous thievery as a fait accompli, or arm Ukraine to the teeth — now.
