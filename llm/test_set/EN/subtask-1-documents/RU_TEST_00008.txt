Is Brussels serving US interests? – Part 2 

 Is Brussels serving US interests? – Part 2

Whether we look at the handling of the war situation, the migration or the energy crisis, we see that the actions of Europe's decision-makers seek to favour US globalists, instead of serving the interests of Europeans. In its series of articles, V4NA attempts to find out what is behind all this. We examined the background of those in the "EU government" – the commissioners of the European Commission – and it became clear in the case of many individuals, at times with just a brief investigation, that they are members of George Soros's globalist network.

The past of the European Commission’s president includes an intrinsic connection to the US oligarch, as Germany’s former defense minister Ursula von der Leyen served in the same organisation – – the advisory board of the Munich Security Conference – as Alexander Soros, the heir apparent of his father’s Open Society network. Although Ms von der Leyen is no longer a member of this advisory board, it is worth noting that, besides Alexander Soros, it boasts a number of illustrious leftist-liberal members such as David Miliband, president of IRC, an international organisation helping migrants, or Radoslaw Sikorski, Poland’s former foreign minister. Mr Sikorski’s wife, Anne Applebaum, is a true representative of the US speculator’s interests. It is worthy of mention that the historian of Polish descent is also present on the advisory board of Action for Democracy (AD), an pseudo-NGO implicated in the Hungarian left wing’s illicit foreign funding scandal.

Returning to the EC chief, the above image portraying her in 2012 as Germany’s labour and social affairs minister in informal talks with George Soros and another investor, Nicolas Berggruen, went viral shortly after it was taken. One wonders what the discussions were about…

Frans Timmermans is a friend of George Soros

Looking at the other members of the European Commission, such as first VP Frans Timmermans, the suspicion that the EC is completely tethered to US globalist forces grows even stronger.

Mr Timmermans makes no effort whatsoever to hide his affinity for Mr Soros and his open society concepts. In an earlier interview, he called the billionaire his friend. As one of the EU leaders with whom the globalist tycoon has met most frequently in recent years, Mr Timmermans expressed his appreciation for Mr Soros on numerous occasions, repeatedly defending the US speculator.

This is what the EC First VP said about him a few years ago: „I have no doubt that he is sincerely and truly committed to freedom, democracy and an open society that guarantees equal rights to its citizens. I have shared this commitment myself throughout my professional career, and I will stick to it until my last breath.”

Mr Timmermans and his immediate colleagues held several meetings with the George Soros’s organisations, for example with the European Policy Center (EPC), or with Avaaz, and with representatives of the Open Society European Policy Institute (OSEPI), the Kontra news portal pointed out in an earlier article. The Hungarian site’s piece also mentions Valdis Dombrovskis, the executive VP in charge of promoting a human-centric economy, who met with representatives of The Project Syndicate, considered the billionaire’s ‘message board’, in Brussels on 25 February 2020.

In light of this, perhaps it comes as little surprise that Mr Timmermans, himself a hypocritical waster of energy, was one of the strongest proponents of extending sanctions to include, among other things, energy carriers, which mostly served the economic interests the US.

Margrethe Vestager, Soros’s hammer in the fight with the tech giants

Another of the EC’s executive vice-presidents, Margrethe Vestager, also maintains intensive ties with Mr Soros. According to press reports from 2018, Ms Vestager and Mr Timmermans held a joint meeting with the billionaire and discussed a number of issues. „I’ve been talking to George Soros periodically for at least twenty years now, and the topic is always the same. How can we help to strengthen cohesion in Europe? It all started with the realisation that although Europe’s division has ended, a lot of work and effort must be made in order for the two halves of Europe to really get closer to each other. Mr Soros was committed to this goal from the beginning, and this has also been my task in some shape and form,” Mr Timmermans said at the time.

But a few years ago, when Google and Facebook were in the midst of a feud with George Soros, the speculator himself praised Ms Vestager, saying that she would be the fate of these big companies in Europe.

Josep Borell had a confidential meeting with Soros on migrant boats

Josep Borrell Fontelles, EU high commissioner in charge of promoting the EU as a global leader, made a statement a few days ago, which caused palpable outrage. Following a session of foreign ministers, the Spanish politician said that no one expected European sanctions to stop Russia’s war. This, however, is in complete contradiction to the statements made by EU officials in the spring and especially in the early summer, when sanctions on Russian energy were being rammed through the member states.

Earlier, as Spain’s foreign minister, Mr Borrell held an hours-long discussion with George Soros in the company of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. The discussion may have focused on promoting the resettlement of migrants in Europe, according to leaks in the press, something that served the US speculator’s interests. Today, they unanimously argue in favour of the sanctions.

Mr Borell, however, makes no secret of his commitment to the Soros empire, so much so that in September 2022 he published an article on Project Syndicate, in which he also argued that the strategy against the Russians was working and should be continued. As is known, Project Syndicate is George Soros’s homegrown media outlet, also known as the speculator’s private „message board”.

„True, Russia has benefited from the recent gas price increases. but this does not mean that sanctions have failed. Instead, we should wait to see the full impact of Europe’s decision to reduce its energy imports from Russia,” the senior official explained.

The EU commissioner, who has millions in assets, has mockingly described Brussels’ anti-Russia sanctions impoverishing Europe as part of a „reduced diet.” In the meantime, during a period of war and epidemics, he has increased his wealth by hundreds of thousands of euros in recent years, as his asset declaration reveals. At the time, V4NA has covered that story.

Johannes Hahn may have been involved in EU misappropriations case

Johannes Hahn, the Commissioner for Budget and Administration, also proudly posed with George Soros a few years ago, saying „it is always good to meet with George Soros to discuss our joint efforts to accelerate reforms in the Balkans and Eastern Europe”.

Against this backdrop, it comes as no surprise that Commissioner Hahn is working to sink Europe ever deeper in debt in a bid to finance Ukraine’s operations from loans, pushing the EU to the brink of economic collapse.

The budget commissioner’s troubled finances were exposed by the Hungarian Kontra news outlet, which wrote that Mr Hahn may have been involved in a European Union misappropriations case. During his the previous term the Austrian politician was in charge of European Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations. His office was audited by the European Court of Auditors chaired by Karel Pinxten, who is also implicated in the most egregious misappropriations scandal of the EU’s history.

Mr Hahn attended Ms Pinxten’s luxury dinners and hunting adventures on several occasions, including on 12 and 13 December 2015. Although their bills were covered by the European Court of Auditors, i.e. European taxpayers, Mr Hahn somehow did not consider these invitations important enough to mention them in the name of transparency. He also maintains close ties with Helga Berger, a member of the Court of Auditors’ chamber that oversees his current portfolio.

According to the French newspaper, the two Austrian officials also dined together on 11, 14 and 28 June 2021.

OLAF, an institution tasked with thoroughly investigating and controlling all financial and funding irregularities, has remained eerily silent both in the Pinxten case and during the preliminary investigation concerning the dealings of Commissioner Johannes Hahn.

Succumbing to the amount of pressure coming from the Commission and unnamed member states, the organisation eventually decided to drop (at least) the latter case, the French Liberation reported. And today, the Commissioner in charge of overseeing OLAF is none other than former Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn.
