Madman Bill Gates pushing world governments to force his new GMO crops and livestock on their people 

 Through a company called "Breakthrough Energy," Gates hopes to replace the world's food supply with artificial fruits, vegetables and meat products that he owns, basically giving him total control over everything.

The Breakthrough Energy company through which Gates hopes to accomplish this global food takeover is a collective of organizations also founded by Gates back in 2015 that have as their goal the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions to stop climate change.

All of these organizations operate under the banner of Breakthrough Energy and include various other initiatives related to global warming. There is also Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), a venture capital firm founded by Gates and connected to Breakthrough Energy.

Several ultra-wealthy tech and business leaders control BEV on behalf of Gates and focus their time and energy on investing in startups that have the potential, they say, to reduce global emissions by at least one percent by developing climate-friendly technologies.

BEV also has a "catalyst" program that focuses on funding unique, commercial-scale projects in areas such as sustainable aviation fuel, geothermal power and methanol-driven fuel cells.

"The overarching goal of Breakthrough Energy aligns with a broader, global initiative to develop and deploy critical climate solutions necessary for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050," reports explain. "This ambition reflects a growing global consciousness about the urgent need to address climate change and its impacts effectively."

Gates is also working on injecting every last cattle animal with mRNA "vaccines" for the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) and other diseases, supposedly.

Many are beginning to suspect that perhaps Gates is also involved in the string of mysterious fires that have occurred over the past several years at food factories all across the country.

"I believe Gates and these climate change lunatics are behind the explosions, fires and terrorism at food and energy plants to push their disgusting vegan fake lab food and toxic battery EVs and green energy," one commenter wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

"Where is the outrage by the GOP? Why aren't there investigations? These are not coincidences! This is homegrown terrorism! DOJ? FBI? Silent!" wrote another person.

Another wrote that Gates "is a disturbed boy in a man's body," further describing him as a pedophile whom the world would be better off without.

"History is littered with egocentrics like him who are so full of themselves they believe half the world needs to bow down to them and follow their lead," wrote another. "Something about excessive wealth and power that drives them nuts and makes them a danger to others."

Someone else commented that the reason Gates keeps trying to reinvent and alter the things God made is "because he is of satan and satan has been doing this since God cast him out of heaven."
