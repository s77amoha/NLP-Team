What is WBGT ? 

 “The flooding had nothing to do with “climate change” – it was a fairly common stronger monsoon but with even more rain.” Right. It happened in- get this- a FLOOD PLAIN- which has probably flooded a million times (or more) in the past few million years. I’m always amazed when people think a flood is an unnatural event. It’s only unnatural if our human created infratructure fails. (dams, poorly designed structures in the flood plain, deforestation in the watershed, etc.)

The WBGT is an example of the increasing occurrence of scientism, in this case the use of numbers in specious observations to reach a pre-determined conclusion. The most important statement in the above is that WBGT is “ Just a number that can be compared only to other numbers of the same index. It is not a measure of sensible heat.” It’s not a reality but an abstraction.

Ahh, good times. Back in the 1980’s the environmental science department at the University of Lancaster, (Lancashire) would send scienceundergr aduates into the carpark to swing a wet bulb in the driving wintry rain. Well, you’ll be forgiven for not being surprised that it registered the same as the dry bulb. 100% humidity at 5 Celsius. Not nice, but it’s grim up North as they say over here.

The New! Improved! WBGT Index uses a metal globe painted black and positioned in direct sun to simulate the perceived heat of a person working outside. As such, it sounds like the pseudo-scientific equivalent of the “cooler” — a metal box where the prison camp commandant locked the British captive in the war movie “Bridge Over the River Kwai.” In other words, WBGT is a torture chamber used to intimidate the other prisoners. If there’s any science in this, it’s the science of propaganda to induce fear and despair into unwitting civilians held captive by climatista activists.

Colonel Nicholson came to his senses in that 1957 opus. It’s up for grabs if today’s mad hatters club will ever do the same.

OMG! This is nothing more than the old familiar “heat index” we’ve had forever – with a few extra variables thrown in! This has *NOTHING* to do with predicting the future “heat index”. It’s nothing more than more of the old IBM “FUD” factor (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) being used by climate scientists trying to rationalize their belief in CAGW in order to keep the money and power flowing! My Vantage Vue weather station calculates what it labels THW. It’s the heat index (temp, humidity, wind). I’ve had it since 2012. If I were to add a UV meter it would calculate THSW (temp, humidty, sun, wind). And these folks think they have come up with something new?
