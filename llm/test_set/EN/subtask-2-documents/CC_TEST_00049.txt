 Eco-warriors are not only morons but hypocrites too! says ESTHER MCVEY

Milk poured on a floor, tomato soup thrown at a painting and chocolate cake smeared on a face - you would be forgiven for thinking this was the act of a petulant toddler left by an open fridge (or maybe even the latest craze in modern art) but in fact it is the latest antics of the idiot members of the cult-like group, Just Stop Oil.

Apart from the bubbling rage I feel towards these puerile eco-zealots, I feel a sense of confusion too. Do they really think they are winning over hearts and minds when they block the road stopping ambulances getting to hospital or children getting to school?

Do they think they win allies when they smear King Charles’ waxwork model with cake – a man who has done more for the environment than those jerks will ever do – and what exactly is the point of soiling the artwork of Van Gogh, a penniless painter, who saw beauty and emotion in art, and who suffered terribly from mental illness and turned to religion before eventually killing himself?

I see no exceptionalism in what they do, unlike the people and works of art they deface to get noticed. Instead, I see spoilt, moronic children riddled with intolerance, determined their righteous views are put above everyone and everything else.

So I laughed out loud when I found out who these holier-than-thou eco-warriors were being funded by none other than the grand-daughter of oil tycoon and – once the richest man in the world – J Paul Getty. How hilariously ironic that those who rail against the oil industry should be funded from it.

Not only are they intolerant, they are hypocritical too – especially given that they targeted Van Gogh’s work because they want to protest about museums receiving funding from the fossil fuel industry.

Aileen Getty set up the Climate Emergency Fund back in 2020 and this year the biggest grant of £1million went to Just Stop Oil and – as it is not registered as a company or a charity in the UK – its location and use of its wealth is not declared.

From her home in California, J Paul Getty’s granddaughter can watch her protests – being waged by her numbskull puppets – unfolding around the world.

When these Just Stop Oil idiots twig where their funding is actually coming from, I wonder if they will then turn their direct action on themselves? Maybe block themselves as they leave their house. Perhaps they will glue themselves to their own front doors. We can but hope. At least it would spare us from them.
