The Public Health Red Meat Allergy Bioengineering Plot Thickens… 

 WTF did I just heard? Please listen until the end. pic.twitter.com/bk0iIn6uI4 Spinte Orthobro ☦️ ∞/21M₿ (@bitcoinorthobro) June 22, 2021 “People eat too much meat. And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help the planet.

But people are not willing to give up meat . Some people will be willing to, but other people – they may be willing to but they have a weakness of will. They say ‘this steak is just too juicy, I can’t do that.’ I’m one of those by the way. So here’s a thought. So it turns out that we know a lot about — we have these intolerances… For example, I have a milk intolerance. And some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human engineering to make the case that we’re intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins. There’s this thing called the Lone Star tick where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat… So that’s something we can do through human engineering . We can possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.” This level of evil – openly plotting to trigger autoimmune disease in humans without their consent at the population level – is nearly unspeakable. At the same forum, Liao advocated “editing” humans to become “so small that we get eaten by cats,” again for the sake of “climate change.”

Were these psychopaths to succeed with this and any of their many other bioengineering projects under the guises of Public Health™, fighting “climate change,” etc., then nothing the Third Reich did, or even fantasized doing in Dr. Mengele’s wildest dreams, to the undesirables would remotely compare. This is a war – of a different kind than we have seen historically – “unrestricted warfare,” as the CCP calls it — but a war nonetheless. As such, we need Nuremberg II now. People like Matthew Liao are not civilians; they must be I don’t know how this is going to be politically feasible, given the highly controlled and totally compromised political machine in the US and across the West,
