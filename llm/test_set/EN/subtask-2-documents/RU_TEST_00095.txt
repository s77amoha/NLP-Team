From making several claims about nuclear weapons, to calling Putin an “Emperor”, he is often used by Kremlin-back television as the arbiter of big claims.

The war-mad leader even goes as far as blaming “Western media” for the bad news instead of his own failings.

The source claims: “Putin reacted to reports about the real situation in something like this: in an annoyed manner."
