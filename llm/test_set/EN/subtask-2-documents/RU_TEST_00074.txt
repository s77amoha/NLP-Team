Arrest Warrant Issued for Putin for War Crimes? Hold on a Minute! 

 By Janet Phelan The International Criminal Court at the Hague has issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin of Russia. NPR reports that “The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes involving accusations that Russia has forcibly taken Ukrainian children.” At the very same time that these charges are being launched against Putin, these stories about forcible taking of children in the US appeared in my newsfeed.

This investigation alleges that children are being taken for profit by America’s justice system. A snapshot of this story states that these children remain in custody despite orders for their release. And here is an article concerning a federal judge ordering a thirteen-year-old girl handcuffed during a hearing involving her father. The article alleges that what Judge Benitez did to the young girl constitutes torture. And this story reveals sex-trafficking of children in the state of Florida, which resulted in some arrests. All these stories took place in “the land of the free,” where every day there are new accusations of atrocities committed by DCFS and the courts in pursuit of removing children from their homes. But this is America, right? And America cannot be accused of war crimes when it is not at war, right? Besides, we’re the good guys. Right? The US (like Russia) does not recognize the International Criminal Court. So charges which could potentially be launched against the US are usually not attended to by the court or its attorneys. However, that reality does not seem to affect the relationship between Russia and the ICC.

A recent effort involved contacting the entire list of ICC-certified attorneys in the US concerning allegations that the US is now using covert weaponry against some of its citizens, in clear violation of crimes against humanity codified in the Rome Statute. As the US does not recognize the Rome Statute, you can probably guess how many US attorneys were interested in taking on the case, despite an accumulation of damning evidence. None. There seems to be a peculiar amount of heady influence that the US wields at the ICC. Clearly, it would appear that with neither the US nor Russia recognizing the Rome Statute and the jurisdiction of the ICC that there would be some equality in the dispensation of attention to war crimes, crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity committed by either nation. However, this appears not to be the case. In light of the hundreds of thousands of US families now victimized by the forcible taking of children through actions by DCFS and the courts, one might hope that there would be equal attention paid to this issue at the ICC. Unless the ICC is also owned by US interests. Given the circumstances cited above, this possibility needs further investigation.

NPR goes on to report Russia’s responses to the ICC charges: “The very question itself is outrageous and unacceptable,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Russia, like a number of other states, does not recognize the jurisdiction of this court, and therefore any of its decisions are insignificant for the Russian Federation from a legal viewpoint.” “Legal viewpoint.” Now that is an interesting perspective. We’ll be watching this international “legal” action to see if the “legal” aspect is indeed the prevailing issue here or if the power being exerted through the ICC moves to the foreground.
