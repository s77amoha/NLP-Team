NATO And Its Kiev Proxy in Last Roll of the Dice 

The NATO NeoNazi regime in Kiev is going for broke, as its Third Reich forbears did during World War Two. This time around, though, the fascists have a nuclear terrorist card to play.

As in the endgame of World War Two, the Nazi Wehrmacht tried to break out in Kursk as a way to divert from battlefield losses elsewhere on the crumbling Eastern Front. The gamble proved futile then and looks like repeating disastrously today. The New Jerusalem: Zio... Best Price: $23.80 Buy New $13.00 (as of 09:07 UTC - Details)

Vladimir Zelensky, the illegitimate puppet president of Ukraine, is out of troops and money. His insufferable begging routine for more weapons and money has become played out. His country is set to default on eye-watering debts to international creditors. Russia’s military advances in the Donbass – formerly eastern Ukraine now part of the Russian Federation – have succeeded in pushing the Kiev regime to the brink of collapse despite the latter receiving hundreds of billions of dollars worth of NATO weaponry.

Zelensky, who is still clinging on to power nearly six months after he cancelled elections, senses the end is nigh for his corrupt regime and its war racket. With over 600,000 dead soldiers and remaining civilians hiding or fleeing in fear of conscription, the ex-comedian throws the dice with a few brigades despatched on a suicide cross-border raid on Russia’s Kursk region.

“The Kursk maneuver could herald the end of Ukraine militarily,” remarked Gustav Gressel, a former Austrian defense ministry official, in an interview with Der Spiegel.

Gressel suggested that the Ukrainian brigades represent the final reserves for the NATO-backed Kiev regime. Once they are wiped out by the superior Russian forces then there will be nothing left for the Kiev side.

The BBC reported – with an air of glee – that convoys of troops are heading from Ukraine’s Sumy region across the border into Russia’s Kursk. The offensive has been going on for a week now, which Moscow says involves indiscriminate attacks on civilians and residential homes. The Kiev regime has said candidly that the objective is to “instill fear” among civilians. That’s a brazen admission of terrorism.

If Kiev’s other objective is to divert Russian forces from Donbass, that doesn’t seem to be working. Russian forces continue to make gains in the direction 0f Donbass – the main battlefield of this conflict.

So, what is the Zelensky junta playing at? It’s a terror tantrum to try to show his NATO sponsors that their proxy regime is still worth backing. The wasting of Ukrainian military lives is a desperate “working off loans for his masters”, as Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova put it.

Sending his people to die is Zelensky’s attempt to show his regime is still “liquid”. But it’s a final act of desperation. When this futile foray into Kursk is spent then it’s over.

As part of the final desperate act, the nuclear terrorism card is also being played – again.

While the incursion in Kursk is going on, the Ukrainian side has tried to attack the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant and the Zaporozhye Nuclear Power Plant. The ZNPP has come under constant shelling from the Armed Forces of Ukraine enabled with U.S.-made HIMARS missiles and other NATO weapons since Russia took over the civilian power plant – the largest in Europe – soon after the conflict erupted in February 2022. Russia took control at an earlier stage precisely because it anticipated that if it didn’t, the Kiev regime would use it as a false flag provocation regardless of the radiological contamination of Europe.

In the latest strike, one of the cooling towers at the ZNPP was set on fire. Russia says the tower was hit by a drone. Moscow denounced what it called “nuclear terrorism” and it called on the international community to sanction Ukraine.

Moscow is wasting its breath. Numerous calls for condemnation over previous air strikes on the ZNPP by the Ukrainian side have been ignored or willfully covered up by the West.

Shamefully, the United Nations nuclear inspection body, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has also participated in the charade of pretending to not know who is attacking the ZNPP. Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director, acts like Manuel, the hapless waiter in Fawlty Towers: “I know nothing.”

The Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Zakharova nailed it with caustic irony, asking rhetorically: “Where is Rafael Grossi and the entire IAEA team?”

She added in a concise summary: “The terrorists in Kiev, under the leadership of the collective West, destroyed their country, ruined the people of Ukraine, undermined world energy and food security, and now they have taken up nuclear terror on the continent [of Europe]”.

Laughably, the BBC and Guardian reported that Russia and Ukraine are “trading blame” for who is behind the attack on the ZNPP.

The British media outlets even quoted nonsense from Zelensky claiming that Russia had caused the fire (in a power plant it controls) by burning auto tires in one of the cooling towers. In comments belying projection, Zelensky said Russia was “blackmailing the world”. The Telomere Effect: A... Best Price: $3.01 Buy New $6.95 (as of 09:07 UTC - Details)

The Kiev regime has committed countless false-flag atrocities – from murdering its own people in the “Bucha massacre” to shelling children’s hospitals, theaters and apartment blocks. Nothing is beyond the depravity of this NeoNazi outfit. Attacking the nuclear plants in Kursk and Zaporozhye in a calculated gamble for inciting deeper NATO involvement is the hallmark of this regime.

As Gressel, the former Austrian military policymaker remarked, the Ukrainian regime is acting like “an unreliable daredevil”.

It’s going down and seems ready to take the rest of the world with it.

However, ultimately, it is the United States and its NATO war machine that are responsible for the calamitous situation. The empire of lies created the terrorist Frankenstein monster solely for its reckless and criminal geopolitical ambitions against Russia to maintain its waning imperial power. The proxy war is lost in the worst debacle for Western imperialism possibly since the end of World War Two. Washington, the EU and NATO stand naked as spectacles of ignominy and disgrace. That presents an unprecedented precarious dilemma for the defeated U.S. hegemon where all sorts of insane acts can be expected.
