SHEER LUNACY: Bill Gates funding plan to cut down 70M acres of forests in America “to combat global warming” 

 This is another proof that "global warming" is a scam to make the rich become richer. The true reason for the devastation of forests is to acquire saleable carbon offsets.

Gates' plan to take advantage of the natural world for the sake of "climate change" was promoted in an article titled: "Chop Down Forests to Save the Planet? Maybe Not as Crazy as it Sounds." (Related: Bill Gates bankrolling DESTRUCTION OF ALL TREES to stop "global warming.")

The last sentence of the article provides a clue to what this newest scam is all about, which is money.

The said article connects carbon to trading of carbon credits and carbon offsets, which is about the idea to plant trees to suck carbon dioxide from the air and sell the credits to corporations, private jet owners and others who require or wish to cancel out their emissions.

According to Dr. Patrick Moore, the co-founder and former leader of Greenpeace, calling carbon dioxide (CO2) a pollutant is dangerous propaganda. Examining satellite imagery shows how CO2 as nature's fertilizer has regularly been enriching Earth's atmosphere.

And a study carried out on data from 1750 to 2018 has shown this as well. The study calculated that the amount of the atmospheric concentration of anthropogenic fossil-derived CO2 in 2018 was 46.84 ppm out of a total of 405.40 ppm.

The U.S. Forest Service plans to reduce 70 million acres of western forests, mainly in California, over the next decade by removing more than one billion tons of bone-dry biomass. This idea came up following the series of wildfires in California three years ago.

But Roger Pielke, a professor in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Colorado, noted that wildfires used to be much more widespread in past centuries and they are a part of the natural ecosystem. Wildfires around the world were mostly due to human intervention, not the climate change that corporate media supports.

The fires in Greece, Spain, Italy and the Amazon rainforest are most probably because of arson.

Meanwhile, Yale Carbon Containment (CC) Lab, Kodama's partner, is looking forward to making a business out of "earthen vaults" or "biomass vaults."

After a forest thinning, it is usual for logs of marketable size to show up at sawmills, with most of the rest stacked up and then burned under controlled conditions. Kodama prefers to bury the leftovers instead in earthen vaults designed to keep dry and anoxic (oxygen-free) conditions and protect the wood from burning or rotting.

"The greatest risk for this project is the high cost of transporting wood from dispersed sources to a single storage site. Transporting wet wood is significantly more time and energy-intensive than leaving it in the forest. Logistics greatly impact project viability, even if the price of carbon is high," said CC Lab. The company also admitted that biomass vaults are not reasonable, and that "the carbon containment value of burying large volumes of wood may be offset partially or totally by the carbon released from the soils when excavating a storage pit."

According to Merritt Jenkins, Kodama's co-founder and chief executive, they plan to make money from their forest thinning work by selling usable timber and carbon credits from its burial projects. Kodama has already accepted $1.1 million in grants from California's forest fire agency and other organizations.

Kodama ultimately wants to chop down and bury more than 5,000 tons of trees annually.
