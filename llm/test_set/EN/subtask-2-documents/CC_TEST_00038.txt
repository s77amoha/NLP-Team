 Opposing wind farms morally unacceptable – ‘expert’

Well, the alleged expert Lord Deben – shortly to quit as chair of the pompously named Climate Change Committee – would say that, wouldn’t he?

Communities opposed to wind turbines in their local area do not have an “acceptable moral position” according to a climate change expert.

Dozens of large-scale wind farm applications are being considered as Wales tries to reach net zero, says BBC News.

Campaigners say the ambition is putting the Welsh countryside at risk and south Wales already has several wind farms.

Lord Deben, the UK Climate Change Committee chairman, said the onus was on everyone to help reach the target.

“We can’t all the time say we’re in favour of things but somewhere else,” he said.

“That isn’t an acceptable moral position.”

Across Wales communities are mobilising to object to wind farm and pylon developments in their areas.

From Conwy to Carmarthenshire, across mid Wales and the south Wales valleys, hundreds of campaigners are sharing information and ideas about how to fight what they call “colossal” turbines.

In Cwmafan, Neath Port Talbot, Rhodri Williams and Andrew Thomas said in lockdown the hills above their town were a sanctuary, but that peace is at risk from a proposed plan to build 21 turbines which will be visible from their homes.

“At over 200m (656ft) we’re talking around the size of the Eiffel Tower,” said Mr Thomas.

“That’s absolutely colossal. If you stand at the foot of the Eiffel Tower and look up and then you imagine that on top of a mountain range that is already 350m (1,148ft) above sea level. ”

Mr Williams is concerned about the impact on people’s health and the environment and says he would rather they were offshore.

‘Doing our fair share’

“We don’t need these, there are plenty of alternatives. It causes a lot of grief and stress for those who live near them and we should be looking at alternatives like hydro, we should be looking at floating offshore wind, and the tidal lagoon in Swansea,” he said.

“There are over 200 wind turbines in south Wales already, we’re doing our fair share.”

But according to the chairman of the UK’s independent Climate Change Committee, Lord Deben, it is not “proper” to say other places should shoulder the burden for tackling climate change.
