The Latest On Global Warming Is … There Is No Global Warming 

 A new study out of Norway is exactly what was needed to shut down the climate alarmists. Its findings show that man has not set fire to his home planet. Right from the top, in the abstract not 10 lines into the study, the authors get to the point. [emphasis, links added] “Using theoretical arguments and statistical tests we find,” the , “that the effect of man-made CO2 emissions does not appear to be strong enough to cause systematic changes in the temperature fluctuations during the last 200 years. In other words, our words, the greenhouse effect is so weak that it should be sidelined as an argument. From there, the bad news only gets worse for priests of the climate religion. “​​Even if [recently] recorded temperature variations should turn out to deviate from previous variation patterns in a systematic way, it is still a difficult challenge to establish is due to of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases.

The researchers, from Statistics Norway, the government’s official data agency , also address the apparent “ high degree of consensus among many climate researchers that the temperature increase of the last decades is systematic (and partly man-made) ,” while noting that it “is certainly the Of course, the climate zealots won’t like the study. Well, they also won’t like another new paper, this one from the University of Alabama in Huntsville climate scientists Roy Spencer and John Christy, who have submitted in U.S. Data, 1880-2015 to a science journal. They believe “that, not only do the not correct for the (UHI) on temperature trends , the adjusted data appear to have even stronger UHI signatures than in the raw (unadjusted) data. According to Spencer, “the bottom line is that an estimated 22% of the U.S. warming trend 1895 to 2023 , is due to localized UHI effects ,” and that “the effect is In other words, our words , the we’re expected to accept without question is a sham – an argument we’ve been making for more than 20 years. After so many decades, we finally realize that nothing will make these people – that’s right, these people They will continue swearing that is caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and go on – in the same way that doomsday cults swear that they just got the day of doom wrong and then For this, we will be all the poorer , financially and even intellectually.
