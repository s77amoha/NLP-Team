The Big Climate Change Lie: The CO2 Risk to the Planet 

 Modest Proposals to ‘Save the Planet’What’s the proposed solution? How are we going to “save the planet?”

But are any of the claims about the “climate crisis” and climate “science” even true?

Does CO2 Really Cause Rising Temperatures?Rising–and falling–CO2 levels are nothing new. In fact, they’ve been much higher than they are today. Furthermore, there is no epochal correlation or even causation between CO2 levels and higher average global temperatures.

“The record is clear that the world has been warming since about the year 1700, 150 years before we were using fossil fuels,“ Moore said. ”1700 was the peak of the Little Ice Age, which was very cold and caused crop failures and starvation. Before that, around 1000 A.D. was the Medieval Warm Period, when Vikings farmed Greenland. [And] before that, around 500 A.D. were the Dark Ages, and before that, the Roman Warm Period when it was warmer than today, and the sea level was 1–2 meters higher than today.”

More CO2, More Food and OxygenThe reality is that CO2 is actually good for the planet in all sorts of ways, especially when it comes to solving food shortages, says Dr. Craig Idso, chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change.

In fact, the more humans there are, the more farm animals will be needed, and the more CO2 will be produced, leading to more oxygen-producing plants—and more food from those plants and animals will be the result.

EVs Are Killing the Planet–and Our Power GridsAs for EVs, the drive to obtain lithium, which is critical for EV batteries, is destroying the environment at an alarming rate. Lithium mining is destroying fertile land, depleting water tables, poisoning the surrounding areas, killing wildlife, actually increasing CO2 levels, and causing other environmental damage at an alarming rate.

EVs also strain our electrical grids and cost a fortune. And yet, gasoline-powered cars are being phased out. It’s almost as if someone doesn’t want regular people to have their own transportation.

The climate change myth is just that—a myth. It does the very thing it purports to prevent and replaces the Creator with the created. It’s a wicked lie that’s layered upon many other lies and suffused with a toxic religiosity evangelized by a thin stratum of inhumanity known as the global elite, who gather with their private jets and decide, over filet mignon, how much they’ll take away from the rest of us and how they'll funnel power to the state.

A Planet Designed for HumanityBut humanity isn’t what’s wrong with the planet.

In fact, one could say that Earth is remarkably unique and was specifically made for human beings to live and to thrive. The biblical edict to “be fruitful and multiply” seems a lot wiser, healthier, and much more enjoyable than lithium mining and eating bugs.

That’s because it is.
