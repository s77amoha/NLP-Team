Belarusian Officer: There’s Panic In The Army 

 The Russians will not defend Lukashenka.

The advancement of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, as Charter97.org learned, has shocked the Belarusian military.

As a Belarusian officer said on condition of anonymity, in the first days the military was seriously afraid that they would be sent to the Kursk region:

— Now there is an understanding that, most likely, the Belarusians will not be sent anywhere. But in the first days, when it became clear that the Ukrainians easily entered the Kursk region, panic set in.

They immediately started talking about obligations in the CSTO, recalling the events in Kazakhstan, when our soldiers were being transferred there. But it is one thing to fight some rebels, and here is the army of a warring country.

In chats, people sent each other videos of captured Russian conscripts. We understand that if such an operation had been conducted against us, the advance of the Ukrainian Armed Forces would have been similar, if not even faster.

After all, in the Kursk region, fortifications were allegedly built, various militia gatherings were allegedly held, the border was allegedly protected, but the Ukrainians broke through in a matter of hours.

If the Russians are defending their land in this way, if they still have not coped with the attack on their territories, then how will they defend Lukashenka?

— How would events have developed if the Belarusians had been transferred to the Kursk region?

— It depends on who would have been transferred. I think if they had sent the Special Operations Forces, some ideologically charged comrades, they would have simply been shot there. They have no combat experience.

However, I am not sure that Lukashenka would have sent the only more or less combat-ready units. As for the other troops, questions about loyalty begin. Mass surrender could have started.
