Vantage | Is poisoning of Ukraine spy chief's wife part of old Russia playbook? 

 As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its grim second year, a new and ominous chapter has unfolded with the poisoning of Marianna Budanova, the wife of Ukraine’s spy chief, Kyrylo Budanov. This incident marks a disturbing turn in the ongoing hostilities between the two nations, raising questions about the methods employed and the potential infiltration of intelligence agencies.

The conflict has reached a virtual stalemate with both sides fortifying their positions as winter sets in. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s counteroffensive has stalled and Russia maintains its occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine. As the war approaches its two-year mark, tensions continue to escalate.

F-16 factor

The focus now shifts to the military strategies employed by both sides. Ukraine is placing its hopes on the acquisition of F-16 fighter jets with expectations of receiving the first batch before the new year. Meanwhile, Russia appears to be resorting to covert tactics introducing the alarming element of poison into the conflict.

The use of poison, a notorious tool in Putin’s arsenal to silence critics, has now found its way to the Ukrainian battlefield. Marianna Budanova has become the first known target of this insidious method. Reports indicate that the Ukrainian intelligence unit G-U-R, responsible for the country’s security, has confirmed her poisoning along with several other officials, all now hospitalised.

The aftermath of Marianna Budanova’s poisoning raises serious questions about a potential breach in Ukraine’s intelligence unit. Accusations are being thrown between the two nations with Russia placing blame on Ukraine citing it as a case of infighting. This incident sheds light on the vulnerability of high-profile Ukrainian leaders and their families.

Kyrylo Budanov: A targeted spy chief

Kyrylo Budanov, a 37-year-old Lieutenant General and chief of Ukraine’s main spy agency since 2020, has been a thorn in Moscow’s side. Known for orchestrating attacks deep inside Russian territory, Budanov has survived at least 10 assassination attempts including a botched car bombing in 2019. His actions have made him a hate figure in Russia further escalating tensions.

Moscow has levied charges against Budanov, linking his unit to the killings of pro-war Russian figures, including Vladlen Tatarsky, a blogger, and Darya Dugina, a journalist and the daughter of a close ally of Putin. These charges make Budanov a prime target for Russian agencies.

History of covert poisoning in Russia

The use of poison as a weapon is not new in Russian tactics. Notable victims include Alexei Navalny, Putin’s vocal opposition politician currently serving a 30-year jail term, and the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London. The recurring theme of poisoning critics underscores the ruthless methods employed by Russian intelligence.

The poisoning of Marianna Budanova adds a sinister dimension to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As the war rages on, the international community watches with concern, grappling with the use of poison as a tool of war. The incident raises urgent questions about the safety of high-profile individuals and the potential infiltration of intelligence units, further complicating an already volatile situation.
