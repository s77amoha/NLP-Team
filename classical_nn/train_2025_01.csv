Bill Gates has the right to fly around the world on private jets while normal people are forced to live in 15 minute cities without freedom of travel, according to Bill Gates himself, who told the BBC he is doing much more than anybody else to fight climate change.

Gates claimed that because he continues to “spend billions of dollars” on climate change activism, his carbon footprint isn’t an issue.

“Should I stay at home and not come to Kenya and learn about farming and malaria?” Gates said in the interview with Amol Rajan.

“I’m comfortable with the idea that not only am I not part of the problem by paying for the offsets, but also through the billions that my Breakthrough Energy Group is spending, that I’m part of the solution,” Gates added. Watch:

Earlier this year, Gates flew around Australia on board his $70 million dollar luxury private jet lecturing people about climate change and ordering them to stop flying on planes.

Gates, who has declared that the energy crisis is a good thing, owns no fewer than FOUR private jets at a combined cost of $194 million dollars.

A study carried out by Linnaeus University economics professor Stefan Gössling found that Gates flew more than 213,000 miles on 59 private jet flights in 2017 alone.

Gates emitted an estimated 1,760 tons of carbon dioxide emissions, over a hundred times more than the emissions per capita in the United States, according to data from the World Bank.

Elsewhere during the carefully constructed interview, Gates said he was surprised that he was targeted by ‘conspiracy theorists’ for pushing vaccines during the pandemic.

 Russian riot police clashed with protesters in Bashkortostan following the sentencing of rights activist Fail Alsynov to four years in a penal colony. Social media footage captured the confrontations near the court in Baymak, with supporters engaging in clashes with police, including throwing snowballs.

Alsynov’s conviction for inciting ethnic hatred sparked rare large-scale protests in Russia, where the risk of arrest typically stifles such demonstrations. Reports suggest thousands participated in the multi-day protest in -20°C temperatures, resulting in several injuries. 

The activist denies the charges related to insulting migrants during a demonstration against gold mining plans. Supporters claim the case is retaliation for Alsynov’s activism against soda mining in a culturally significant area. He allegedly referred to Central Asians and Caucasians, comprising a significant portion of Russia’s migrant population, as “black people” in the Bashkir language. 

Alsynov contends the Bashkir words meant “poor people” and were mistranslated into Russian. He plans to appeal the verdict. Alsynov has previously criticized military mobilization in the region as “genocide” against the Bashkir people. Ongoing concerns exist about the disproportionate deployment of ethnic minorities, including Bashkirs, in conflicts such as Ukraine. 

Alsynov was a leader of Bashkort, a grassroots movement focused on preserving Bashkir ethnic identity, which was banned as extremist in 2020.

 American fast-food giant McDonald said Monday it will exit Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion.

merican fast-food giant McDonald said Monday it will exit Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, ending a more than three-decade run begun in the hopeful period near the end of the Cold War.

The restaurant chain, which launched in Moscow in January 1990 to great fanfare almost two years before the Soviet Union was dissolved, characterized the withdrawal as difficult but necessary.

""The humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald's to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable, nor is it consistent with McDonald's values,"" the company said in a statement.

The chain is looking to sell ""its entire portfolio of McDonald's restaurants in Russia to a local buyer.""

The burger giant is one of numerous foreign firms that have pulled out of the country or suspended operations following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in late February.

Earlier on Monday, French automaker Renault announced it had handed over its Russian assets to the government, marking the first major nationalization since the onset of Western sanctions against Moscow's military campaign.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into pro-Western Ukraine on February 24, triggering unprecedented sanctions and sparking an exodus of foreign corporations including H&M, Starbucks and Ikea.

 Stakeholders at a programme on Sunday said that collaborative strategies and innovation were keys to unlocking Bangladesh’s circular apparel industry for availing a significant opportunity for the country to reduce its environmental impact, improve its economic performance and create social benefits.

The readymade garment sector in Bangladesh is under a transformative journey towards circularity, but embracing circularity also poses certain challenges that must be collectively considered and resolved, they said.

A panel of industry leaders, policymakers and experts in circular economies made the comments at an event titled ‘Switch to Upstream Circularity Dialogue: Pre-consumer Textile Waste in Bangladesh’ at the Amari Hotel in Dhaka on Sunday.

The event was organised under the Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project (SWITCH2CE), co-funded by the European Union and the government of Finland.

Parliamentary standing committee on the ministry of environment, forest and climate change chairman Saber Hossain Chowdhury was present in the opening session as chief guest.

Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association president Faruque Hassan spoke at the opening session as special guest.

Deputy head of European Union to Bangladesh delegation mission Bernd Spanier, SWITCH2CE chief technical adviser Mark Draeck, among others, also contributed to the event’s opening session.

Hilde van Duijn, head of Global Value Chains, Circle Economy, also participated in the event and made circular game demonstration.

Faruque Hassan said, ‘Living in a world in our time where climate is most threatened, business as usual is no more an option. In a race to zero emission and resource decoupling, circularity emerges as the “next normal” linking business and sustainable development. For the BGMEA, circularity sits in the core of our values, mission and vision. Our goal is to help conserve the natural eco-system as much as possible via an economic shift from a linear to circular system, while generating greater social and economic values.’

Mark Draeck said, ‘With the support of the European Union and the government of Finland, UNIDO leads the global Switch to Circular Economy Value Chains project.’

‘In Bangladesh, we support the circular transition for the textile and garments industry, by piloting innovative circular solutions in close cooperation with global and national industry leaders, which as BESTSELLER, H&M and their manufacturers,’ he said.

‘These pilots will address acute challenges on new technology, business models and traceability, and will demonstrate the economic opportunity for circular approaches.

EN_UA_300041.txt,Other,Other,"Russia intends to supply light ‘Mountain’ tanks, infantry fighting vehicles to India 

 Russia’s state-owned arms company, Rosoboronexport, has declared its intention to participate in the bidding process for the supply of light tanks and the Future Infantry Combat Vehicle (FICV) to India.

Alexander Mikheyev, the CEO of the Russian company announced the decision with the state-run media outlet TASS during the International Aerospace Exhibition at Dubai Airshow 2023.

Mikheyev outlined plans for collaboration with Indian partners, to introduce a light tank and an advanced infantry fighting vehicle as part of the Indian Ministry of Defense’s FICV project tender. Emphasizing alignment with the principles of the ‘Make in India’ program, he highlighted the intention to contribute to local manufacturing.

In his statements, Mikheyev underlined Russia’s comprehension of the Indian government’s aspirations, acknowledging India’s commitment to achieving technological sovereignty and promoting independent industrial development. The proposed plans reflect a collaborative approach that adheres to the principles of the ‘Make in India’ initiative.

Earlier, Russia signed a contract to supply Igla-S hand-held anti-aircraft missiles to India and allow production of the Igla there under licence, the Russian state news agency TASS quoted a top arms export official as saying on Tuesday.

The Igla-S is a man-portable air defence system (MANPADS) that can be fired by an individual or crew to bring down an enemy aircraft.

India is the world’s largest arms importer and Russia remains its largest supplier despite the damage to the reputation of its army and weaponry from the war in Ukraine, where Russia has suffered numerous setbacks at the hands of a smaller but highly motivated and Western-equipped military.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Russia accounted for 45% of India’s arms imports between 2018 and 2022, with France providing 29% and the United States 11%.

Another Russian state news agency, RIA, quoted Mikheyev earlier as saying that “Rosoboronexport is working with Indian private and public enterprises to organise joint production of aviation weapons and integrate them into the existing aviation fleet in India”.

No details were provided about which Indian companies would be involved or when potential production would start.

Mikheyev said Rosoboronexport and Indian partners had provided the Indian Ministry of Defence with Su-30MKI fighter jets, tanks, armoured vehicles and shells. At the beginning of the year, India and Russia also started joint production of AK-203 Kalashnikov assault rifles.

 By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

he rouble slumped to 100 against the dollar on Monday, hitting three figures for the first time in almost 17 months, struggling under the weight of strong foreign exchange demand and Russia's shrinking balance of trade.

By 0724 GMT, the rouble was 1.4 percent weaker against the dollar at 100.84, passing the 100 threshold for the first time since March 23, 2022.

It lost 1.5 percent to trade at 110.44 versus the euro, also a near 17-month low, and shed 1.3 percent against the yuan to 13.87.

The rouble has chartered a turbulent course since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, slumping to a record low of 120 against the dollar in March last year before recovering to a more than seven-year high a few months later, supported by capital controls and surging export revenues.

Russia's central bank has blamed the rouble's weakening on falling export revenues and recovering imports, but a Kremlin aide on Monday said loose monetary policy was to blame, a sign of discord among Russia's monetary authorities.

Brent crude oil LCOc1, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.9% at $86.05 a barrel, not far from a more than seven-month high hit last week.

The rouble, already under pressure amid robust demand for foreign currency and limited supply from exporting firms, has failed to benefit from strong oil prices.

A trader at a large Russian bank told Reuters the market was confused: ""Everyone is ready for the inflow of revenues from expensive oil, but it seems to be hanging somewhere, and our regulators are somehow indifferent, there is nothing to rely on.""

Russian stock indexes were higher.

""The unstoppable and puzzling growth of the USD/RUB rate...continues to support retail investors' interest in equities as a way to save their depreciating rouble savings,"" said Sinara Investment Bank in a note.

The dollar-denominated RTS index .IRTS was up 0.2 percent to 1,002.7 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 1.6 percent higher at 3,205.4 points, at a pre-invasion high.

EurekAlert news release: Climate: Increasing tropical cyclone frequency may have deadly consequences for seabird populations

The increase in tropical cyclone frequency and intensity due to climate change could lead to dramatic declines in seabird populations, suggests a paper published in Communications Earth & Environment.

The authors’ conclusion is based on the impacts of Cyclone Ilsa on Bedout Island, after the cyclone killed at least 80% of seabirds nesting on the island when it struck in April 2023.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including tropical cyclones.

Individual cyclones can have a dramatic impact on wildlife populations, including seabirds. Cyclones directly affect seabirds in several ways, including causing significant mortality events, disrupting their nesting and breeding patterns, and altering migration strategies.

The increasing frequency of cyclones is already known to have negative impacts on a range of organisms, but the impact on seabird populations is still unclear.

Jennifer Lavers and colleagues studied the impact of Cyclone Ilsa, a category 5 tropical cyclone, on the populations of several seabird species breeding on the 17-hectare Bedout Island, Western Australia, after the cyclone crossed the island on April 13 2023.

They used aerial and ground surveys, conducted between April 17 and July 21 2023, to estimate the percentage mortality of three species — the brown booby (Sula leucogaster), the lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel), and an endemic subspecies of the masked booby (Sula dactylatra bedouti).

The authors estimate that 80–90% of these species’ populations — at least 20,000 individual birds — were killed during the storm, with the losses predominantly adult breeding birds.

The authors warn that this level of population loss for island seabirds may be unsustainable when coupled with the increase in cyclone frequency, as many seabirds are long-lived, have long generation times, and raise very few chicks per year.

 Another of the world’s most recognized and most valuable pieces of art was the target of climate-change activists. Climate crazies tried — and failed — to glue themselves to Edvard Munch’s 1893 painting “The Scream” in Oslo on Friday.

It was yet another example of climate change activists using priceless works of art to protest the use of fossil fuels, which climate zealots believe is leading to global warming. In October, climate activists attacked “Girl with a Pearl Earring” by Johannes Vermeer in The Hague. Climate hysterics were also responsible for an attack on Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” and John Constable’s “The Hay Wain” in London over the summer.

The new climate-related vandalism fad seems to have begun with an attack on Da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa” in which a climate fanatic feigned a disability in order to get close enough to smear a pastry on the painting.

In addition, “Peach Trees in Blossom” by Van Gogh; “My Heart’s in the Highlands” by Horatio McCulloch; “Tomson’s Aeolian Harp” by J.M.W. Turner; “The Last Supper” by Giampietrino; “Sistine Madonna” by Raphael; and “Haystacks” by Monet have been targeted by climate hysterics since May.

As of yet, none of the artwork has been damaged, due to being protected by glass.

Video of Friday’s attack shows two young climate vandals attempting to glue themselves to the artwork. Police apprehended the hooligans, and reported there was some glue residue on the glass that protects the paintings.

“I scream for people dying,” one of the activists shouted.

“I scream when lawmakers ignore science,” the other shouted.

The Norwegian climate activist group Stopp Oljeletinga, which translates to “Stop Oil Exploration,” claimed responsibility for the attack.

The group demands that the Norwegian government declare “an immediate halt to all further exploration for oil on the Norwegian continental shelf,” and present “a concrete plan for fair adjustment for today’s oil workers.”

A spokesperson for the group claimed that the vandalism was an attempt to “pressure lawmakers into stopping oil exploration.”

“We are campaigning against ‘Scream’ because it is perhaps Norway’s most famous painting,” said Astrid Rem, a spokesperson for Stopp Oljeletinga. “There have been lots of similar actions around Europe. They have managed something that no other action has managed: achieve an extremely large amount of coverage and press.”

But there’s good press and there’s bad press. These crazy antics are of the bad variety.

Norway is one of the world’s top oil exporters and provides oil and natural gas to much of Europe, a continent in the midst of a serious energy crunch brought about partly by the war in Ukraine. Russia, the largest supplier of natural gas to Europe, has severely restricted supplies and has shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which it claims was sabotaged.

Without much-needed Norwegian fossil fuels, Europe could be in for an extremely cold winter.

The art world has acknowledged their concern over the new phenomenon:

“In recent weeks, there have been several attacks on works of art in international museum collections. The activists responsible for them severely underestimate the fragility of these irreplaceable objects, which must be preserved as part of our world cultural heritage,” read a statement signed by approximately one hundred gallery directors and museums.

These climate crazies are apparently willing to allow a continent to freeze this winter over their fears of an over-hyped “problem” peddled by globalists who flew more than 400 carbon-spewing private jets to COP27 in Egypt last week.

EN_CC_300008.txt,Other,Other,"“There is so much fallout:” Locals challenge watchdog over coal mine pollution 

 Ros Druce knows there’s toxic coal dust in the air she breathes.

In 2016, NSW’s environmental watchdog tested some of the black residue that had sullied her barbecue area.

“They said it was 15 per cent coal dust back then. But that was before they were blasting four days a week and everything else,” she says from her family’s property, 7km from Whitehaven Coal’s Maules Creek Mine.

“I can’t have a vegetable garden any more because there’s so much fallout from when they blast that it covers all the vegetables, the grass, everything.”

Indoors, it’s more of the same, with coal dust “everywhere” and constant worry about what years of exposure might be doing to her health.

But hope is on the horizon – a Land and Environment Court challenge due to begin on Tuesday.

Ms Druce and other members of the Maules Creek Community Council are contesting the Environment Protection Authority’s 2023 review of the mine’s environmental protection licence.

They will argue the watchdog failed to protect environmental and human health, and did not consider “relevant” pollutants, namely fine-particle pollution and methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas.

Specifically the case will deal with PM2.5 – pollution particles so small they can get deep into the lungs and into the bloodstream.

Prolonged exposure can cause respiratory and cardiovascular disease and shorten lives.

The Environmental Defenders Office is representing the community group and will argue the watchdog did not satisfy a legal requirement to consider relevant pollutants and measures that could reduce that pollution when it renewed the mine’s licence in 2023.

If the community group wins, the EPA would have to carry out a fresh review that considers the impact of all the harmful pollutants, and what could be done to reduce impacts.

Ms Druce says she’s hoping for a “landmark win” that will help anyone who might be in her position.

 Putin’s masses of HIV-positive prisoners choosing to go to meat-grinder frontline rather than rot in jail with no meds

RUSSIAN prisoners who have tested positive for HIV are choosing to be sent to the frontline hoping to get lifesaving medication.

A large number of Vladimir Putin's HIV-positive prisoner recruits deemed they preferred the battlefield rather than rot in jail where they were denied treatment.

The Wagner Group has been mass-recruiting inmates from Russia's infamous prisons, offering them a pardon if they survive for six months.

Ukrainian officials estimate about 20 per cent of recruits in Russian prisoner units are HIV positive.

And a lot of them were so desperate for the anti-viral medications they couldn't get in jail, they opted to join Putin's bloody war in Ukraine, the New York Times reported.

Speaking from a detention centre in Dnipro, an HIV-positive Russian soldier named Timur, 37, told the newspaper: ""Conditions were very harsh.""

He said how doctors in prison changed the anti-viral medication to a different type that he suspected was not effective.

Fearing he was not going to last his ten-year sentence behind bars, agreed to join Putin's bloodthirsty Wagner Group for six months in exchange for a pardon and supplies of anti-viral medications.

Speaking about the dilemma of poor treatment in prison or fight in Ukraine, he said: ""I understood I would have a quick death or a slow death. I chose a quick death.""

Timur, who had no military experience said he had two weeks of training before being deployed to Bakhmut- where one of the bloodiest battles of the war happened.

He said that the unit's commanders ""repeated many times, ‘if you try to leave this field, we will shoot you.’""

While he was captured, he said that most of the soldiers were killed on their first day.

Another soldier named Ruslan, 42, said he welcomed Wagner's acceptance of HIV-positive inmates and joined the frontline for a chance at medication and freedom.

He said: ""If you have a long sentence, it gives you a chance to begin life again.""

New conscripts in Putin's private army were forced to wear coloured-coded wristbands to signify they had serious infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.

Earlier this year, Ukraine's Ministry of Defence claimed that Russia marks these ""sick 'fighters' with appropriate bracelets on their hands"".

""In order to 'mark' infected militants, the command of 'Wagners' forces them to wear red bracelets on the arm in case of HIV, and white bracelets in case of hepatitis,"" the Ministry's Main Directorate of Intelligence said in a statement.

The report suggested that Russian conscripts were furious about having to serve alongside ""infected"" militants and military doctors regularly refused to provide assistance to the infected soldiers if they got wounded on the battlefield.

Another HIV prisoner Yevgeny who suffered a gunshot wound before he was captured, said that although he did receive treatment, he felt medics were careless about infecting other patients around him.

He said: ""There were no conditions for the HIV infected.

""We were all treated together, the healthy and the unhealthy.""

 Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet China’s Xi Jinping for talks in Beijing in October, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, Putin’s first known trip abroad since an arrest warrant was issued against him over the deportation of children from Ukraine.

Nikolai Patrushev, a close Putin ally and the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, said Russia and China should deepen cooperation in the face of the West’s attempt to contain them both.

He was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that the talks in Beijing would be “thorough”, at a meeting in Moscow with China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi.

Putin will attend the third Belt and Road Forum after an invitation by Xi during a high-profile visit to Moscow in March.

Days before that visit, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest on suspicion of illegally deporting hundreds of children or more from Ukraine.

Moscow denies the allegations and the Kremlin said the warrant was evidence of the West’s hostility to Russia, which opened a criminal case against the ICC prosecutor and the judges who issued the warrant.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine early last year has triggered one of the deadliest European conflicts since World War Two and the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Putin has pivoted towards China, and Xi has stood by him.

Chinese-Russian trade has soared since the invasion, and Russia has sold Asian powers including China greater volumes of the oil it can no longer sell to the West because of sanctions.

Putin last visited Beijing in February 2022, days before the invasion, where he and Xi announced a ‘no limits’ partnership. Moscow says this does not mean a military alliance, however.

The United States sees China as its gravest long-term “strategic competitor” and Russia as an “acute threat”.

China has refrained from condemning Russia’s operation against Ukraine or calling it an invasion, in line with the Kremlin, which casts the war as a “special military operation”.

Of course she is - that's her script. Attend protest, get arrested. She is a sad and pathetic figure serving the agenda of the elite while claiming to oppose it 

 Greta Thunberg was arrested by the Metropolitan Police for ‘refusing to move’ when told to by police officers during a protest against an oil and gas conference in central London, according to eyewitnesses.

The 20-year-old Swedish activist could be seen smiling as she was detained by officers and led to a waiting police van after joining a protest outside the Energy Intelligence Forum (EIF) – formerly the Oil and Money conference – at the Intercontinental Hotel Park Lane.

In footage shared on social media, officers could be seen frogmarching the campaigner to the van as other protesters were told to stand back. The Met Police said it had arrested 21 protesters today.

Fossil Free London, which organised the demo, told the PA news agency that Thunberg was arrested while linking arms and changing with other activists; she was reportedly taken to Wandsworth police station.

It’s the latest arrest for the campaigner, who rose to fame after she began ‘striking’ from school in 2018 over what she said was inaction by world governments to tackle climate change.

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has warned that if the United Kingdom signs an imminent deal with Ukraine to put troops in the country, Moscow would consider it as a declaration of war. Medvedev was reacting to the imminent signing of a security agreement between London and Kiev.

Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chair of the Russian Security Council, issued his warning in a social media post.

A visit to Kiev on Friday by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is set to sign a security agreement with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, would ensure British troops would be openly deployed to Ukraine.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Sunak’s arrival in the Ukrainian capital is meant to “set out a major new package of support and reaffirm the close UK-Ukraine partnership,” his office said in a statement. The security document is a follow-up to agreements reached by G7 and NATO members last year, it noted. The statement did not mention any plans for a British military deployment in Ukraine, however, it could be implied.

“[The deal] formalizes a range of support the UK has been and will continue to provide for Ukraine’s security, including intelligence sharing, cyber security, medical and military training, and defense industrial cooperation,” Downing Street said, according to a report by RT.

The British government has pledged £2.5 billion ($3.2 billion) in military aid to Ukraine over the next two years, including in the form of thousands of military drones, which London said will be the largest of their kind ever received by Kiev. Most of the UAVs will be made in the UK, the announcement added. –RT

Moscow has repeatedly accused the UK (and the United States) of helping Ukraine organize attacks against Russia, particularly in the Black Sea. The Russian Defense Ministry has claimed that British military personnel already have a presence in Ukraine.

 Although Ukrainians are doing everything they can to drive out the Russians, ""no one today can predict how long this war will last"", President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says.

""This will depend, unfortunately, not only on our people, who are already giving their maximum,"" he said on Friday in his nightly video address to the nation.

""This will depend on our partners, on European countries, on the entire free world.""

He said he was thankful to those who were working to strengthen the sanctions on Russia and increase military and financial support to Ukraine.

""This is the only recipe for protecting freedom in the face of the Russian invasion. And for Western countries, this is not simply an expense. This is not about accounting, it's about the future.""

Zelenskiy said Ukraine on Friday shot down the 200th Russian aircraft of the war and he noted Russia's heavy losses in tanks, armoured vehicles, helicopters and drones.

""And for what? So that the Lenin statue can stand for a bit longer in temporarily occupied Genichesk? There is and can be no other result for Russia.""

Russian forces in April restored the Lenin statue in Genichesk, a town in the southern Kherson region.

Zelenskiy said Ukraine was engaged in ""very difficult negotiations"" to try to evacuate the wounded fighters trapped in the Mariupol steelworks.

""We're talking about a large number of people. Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate all of the rest, each of our defenders. We have already brought in everyone in the world who can be the most influential mediators.""

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian forces had retaken towns and villages from Russian troops. He said work was under way to restore electricity, running water, telephone communications and social services.

 Millions left with no aid as West Africa suffers worst hunger crisis in 10 years, U.N. says

The U.N. World Food Program said Wednesday that millions of hungry people in West Africa are without aid as the agency struggles with limited funding to respond to the region’s worst hunger crisis in a decade.

Nearly half of the 11.6 million people targeted for food aid during the June to August lean season are not receiving any assistance, the agency said in a statement. It warned that hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of joining armed groups, getting married early or engaging in “survival sex” in their desperation to survive.

“We’re in a tragic situation. During this year’s lean season, millions of families will lack sufficient food reserves to sustain them until the next harvests in September,” said Margot Vandervelden, WFP interim regional director for Western Africa. “We must take immediate action to prevent a massive slide into catastrophic hunger,” she said.

Long before last year’s flooding and Russia’s war in Ukraine, West Africa already was facing its worst food crisis in 10 years with more than 27 million hungry people mainly as a result of conflicts but also due to drought and the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

More than 50 million people in the wider East African region are expected to face acute food insecurity this year.

Food insecurity in West and Central Africa is now affecting 47.2 million people in this year’s lean season, when hunger peaks, the WFP said, with women and children the most vulnerable groups.

“Malnutrition rates have also surged, with 16.5 million children under 5 set to be acutely malnourished this year — an 83% rise from the 2015-2022 average,” the agency said.

In central Sahel countries of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger where jihadists have become increasingly deadly, U.N. agencies estimate that the number of people fleeing violence there has nearly quadrupled from 30,000 in January to 110,000 people in June.

“We need a twin-track approach to stop hunger in the Sahel — we must address acute hunger through humanitarian assistance while tackling the structural causes of food insecurity by increasing investments in resilient food systems and expanding government social protection programs,” Vandervelden added.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],million leave aid west africa suffer bad hunger crisis year u.n say million leave aid west africa suffer bad hunger crisis year u.n say u.n world food program say wednesday million hungry people west africa aid agency struggle limited funding respond region bad hunger crisis decade nearly half million people target food aid june august lean season receive assistance agency say statement warn hundred thousand people risk join armed group getting marry early engage survival sex desperation survive tragic situation year lean season million family lack sufficient food reserve sustain harvest september say margot vandervelden wfp interim regional director western africa immediate action prevent massive slide catastrophic hunger say long year flooding russia war ukraine west africa face bad food crisis year million hungry people mainly result conflict drought economic impact covid- pandemic million people wide east african region expect face acute food insecurity year food insecurity west central africa affect million people year lean season hunger peak wfp say woman child vulnerable group malnutrition rate surge million child set acutely malnourish year rise average agency say central sahel country mali burkina faso niger jihadist increasingly deadly u.n agency estimate number people flee violence nearly quadruple january people june need twin track approach stop hunger sahel address acute hunger humanitarian assistance tackle structural cause food insecurity increase investment resilient food system expand government social protection program vandervelden add

 Exposed: CIA Plotting WW3 With Russia! False Flags Continue As WEF Meet At Davos! - WAM Must Video

Josh Sigurdson reports on the recent news of the CIA committing sabotage attacks inside of Russia and Ukraine as the proxy war continues and shifts closer to a full global conflict.

Recently, an anti-air missile hit a residential apartment complex in Dnipro, Ukraine causing at least 44 casualties. While the Ukrainian government blamed Russia and the Russian government blamed Ukraine, a Ukrainian official has had to resign after accidentally admitting on live television that it was indeed a Ukrainian missile.

An adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky by the name of Oleksiy Arestovych made the stunning claim on Ukrainian television leading to an obviously forced resignation within a day of the statement.

Meanwhile, investigative journalist Jack Murphy has exposed the CIA’s involvement in the conflict as they have been involved in targeted sabotage attacks and false flags within Ukraine and Russia, pushing the conflict further to the brink.

Ukraine’s Defense Minister, Oleksii Reznikov has also been pushing the bar forward as he claims that Ukraine is a de-facto member of NATO.

This is clearly a scripted proxy war to bring the world into conflict and then, of course, the Great Reset. Keep in mind that this conflict was talked about for years by the World Economic Forum which is currently convening in Davos.

 Molotov Cocktail Attack On Russian Embassy In Moldova On Last Day Of Election

Sunday is the final day of three days of presidential elections in Russia. Yulia Navalnaya, the wife of deceased opposition activist Alexei Navalny, is urging mass protests against President Putin as he stands of the verge of winning another six year term as president, an outcome quite obvious to all observers. She's calling on Russians to disrupt the final day of voting in what's been dubbed ""noon against Putin"".

While some sporadic minor incidents at polling stations have been reported, there has been a major incident in the small country of Moldova which borders Ukraine. Moldovan police have detained a man who attacked the Russian embassy with two Molotov cocktails as voting was underway there.

""A man threw two containers of flammable substances over the fence of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau,"" police said in a statement. A 54-year-old Moldovan who described himself as also having Russian citizenship was immediately detained after after hurling the Molotov cocktails.

There were no reports of injuries or damage to the embassy, and police said an investigation is ongoing. ""He justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities,"" authorities said.

Moldova has been scene of controversy and friction especially after Russia allowed the opening of several polling stations in breakaway Transnistria, which the Moldovan government has fiercely protested.

Reuters noted days ago that ""A senior official in ex-Soviet Moldova said on Wednesday Moscow was breaking laws by printing ballot papers in the separatist region of Transnistria ahead of this week's Russian presidential election.""

""Moldova's pro-European authorities have already summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about a decision to open six polling stations in the pro-Russian enclave,"" the report continued. ""The central government said the move broke an agreement to allow voting only at a single polling station at the Russian embassy in Chisinau.""

The United States recently become more vocal in defending Moldova's territorial integrity, and has condemned what the Biden administration has called Moscow's 'interference' in the Eastern European nation's sovereignty.

Last summer, Moldova expelled 45 Russian diplomats and embassy staff members from the country ""over numerous unfriendly actions"" as tensions reached near breaking point over the war in neighboring Ukraine and the Transnistria issue.

The fake obituary read: ""David Attenborough (born May 8th, 1926 in Isleworth, England) was an TV Personality who was best known for being a noted historian working for the BBC.

In the United States, nominal LNG export capacity has risen by 1.9 Bcf/d and peak capacity has risen by 2.1 Bcf/d since November 2021. The U.S. LNG liquefaction capacity averaged 11.4 Bcf/d as of July 2022, with the short-term peak capacity at 13.9 Bcf/d.

Energy companies increased production capacity at LNG facilities in Corpus Christi and Sabine Pass in Texas and the Calcasieu Pass LNG facility in Louisiana.

An unplanned outage at the Freeport LNG export facility in Quintana, Texas, caused U.S. exports to fall by 11 percent in June compared to the average exports in the first five months of the year.

Liquefied Natural Gas in the EUMost of America’s LNG exports during the period of January through May 2022 went to the United Kingdom and the European Union, which accounted for a combined 81 percent of total U.S. exports. The United States accounted for 47 percent of Europe’s total LNG imports in the first half of 2022. LNG imports in the UK and EU rose by 63 percent in the period from January through June 2022.

The EU’s demand for LNG is booming due to historically low natural gas storage inventories and the region’s push to limit imports from Russia.

Since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in late February, the EU has implemented several sanctions against the Russian government. In response, the Kremlin has curtailed gas shipments via the pipeline into Europe.

 Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week announced his intent to spend $500 million on a campaign to replace coal plants and prevent the construction of new natural gas plants in favor of renewable energy sources.

The Washington Examiner noted that this $500 million, along with the $500 million Bloomberg previously gave to the ""Beyond Carbon"" campaign, make it one of the largest philanthropic efforts involving climate change ever.

""By working with our partners across the country, we hope to transform the way we power America by moving beyond fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy,"" Bloomberg, a United Nations special envoy on climate ambition and solutions, said during the U.N. Global Assembly in New York on Wednesday.

In a press release, the former mayor's organization Bloomberg Philanthropies announced that it has helped to retire more than two-thirds of all the coal plants in the United States. The group is also helping to fund several environmentalist groups in the country, including Sierra Club, Earthjustice, and the League of Conservation Voters.

Chris Jahn, chief executive of the American Chemistry Council, hit out at the announcement in a statement to The New York Times.

""Attempts to shut down American chemical manufacturing are a bet against millions of hard-working men and women in our industry,"" Jahn said, adding that this program ""would send essential jobs overseas and threaten America's leadership to innovate and compete with countries like China.""

 Kyiv: Russia is adapting simple bombs to include guidance systems, making them affordable and efficient alternatives to pricey guided missiles. Illia Ponomarenko of the Kyiv Independent claims that the UMPK (unified module for gliding and navigation) technologies appear to be turning ordinary bombs into intelligent ones. 

The enhanced guided or gliding bombs, according to Ponomarenko, present “an especially serious threat to Ukraine” and have the ability to “deliver devastating hits upon Ukrainian lines and the rear front.” According to the site, this device can be used to give Russia’s plentiful supply of outdated Soviet FAB-500M-62 gravity bombs “wings” and a basic satellite navigation system. Russian bombs that had been modified were successfully employed in March to strike Ukrainian defences in Avdiivka, Donetsk. According to Russian media, the production of the kit costs less than 2 million roubles, or about $24,000, making it significantly less expensive than buying missiles and other weaponry from abroad. 

In contrast, one Kalibr cruise missile, which Russia used frequently in its invasion of Ukraine, costs just under $6.5 million. The JDAM-ER kits, which turn existing unguided bombs into precision-guided munitions, were given by the US to Ukraine, and they are identical to the system. Although Russia has not acknowledged making the UMPK kits in substantial quantities, this would be a practical substitute for pricey cruise and ballistic missiles, the stock of which is already largely exhausted. 

According to estimations from the Ukrainian air force, these weapons can have an effective range of more than 50 kilometers, or about 31 miles, the Kyiv Independent said. According to the article, the Ukrainian air force calculates that up to 20 guided bomb hits are made every day along the front line by Russian Su-34 and Sukhoi Su-35 aircraft that are launched from higher heights. 

Ukraine must use air defence systems like the S-300 to fend off the jets in order to stop the Russian attack. According to recently released Pentagon documents, Kyiv’s supply of S-300 weapons is running low and may run out in May. On Wednesday, a number of Patriot missile defence systems sent by Western partners arrived in Ukraine. Additionally, Ukraine has been frantically searching for more ammo for its air defence systems, which have been essential to protect against Russian planes. 

As its Mikoyan MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 are obsolete and do not have contemporary longer-range air-to-air missiles, Ukraine has also been pleading for its Western friends to supply fighter jets to protect against Russian assaults. 

This week, Germany granted Poland’s request to give Ukraine five MiG-29 fighter planes. Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

BORIS Johnson today demanded Vladimir Putin ""steps back from the brink"" of war to avoid a brutal bloodbath in Ukraine.

At showdown talks TONIGHT the PM will warn the sabre-rattling Kremlin strongman he'll be ""bitterly and bloodily resisted"" if he invades.

Russia has marshalled more than 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine and is poised to march in.

Mr Johnson - who is flying to Ukraine tomorrow said an invasion would be ""an absolute disaster for the world"".

Speaking in Essex, Mr Johnson said: ""What I will say to President Putin, as I have said before, is that I think we really all need to step back from the brink.

""I think Russia needs to step back from the brink.

""I think that an invasion of Ukraine, any incursion into Ukraine beyond the territory that Russia has already taken in 2014 would be an absolute disaster for the world, and above all it would be a disaster for Russia.""

He said that any Russian invasion would be ""bitterly and bloodily resisted"" by the Ukrainian people.

The UK is preparing to slam sanctions on banks and oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to turn the thumbscrews on Russia.

British combat soldiers are unlikely to be sent to fight, with the PM instead preferring to cripple Russian firms.

Mr Clarke said this morning: ""We are very clear that if Russia takes further action against Ukraine, then we will further tighten the sanctions regimes targeting those businesses, and people with the closest links to the Kremlin.

""Brexit Britain is one of the foremost opponents of the actions of the Putin regime and if you look at the EU, it is countries like Germany who are dragging their feet when it comes to the the response to this crisis.

EN_UA_102034.txt,"URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy","URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other","Most Taiwanese do not view US as ‘trustworthy’, but majority trusts its security commitment for island: Survey 

 A majority of Taiwanese do not consider the United States a “trustworthy” country, despite expressing belief in Washington’s security commitment to the island, according to a recent survey conducted by National Chengchi University in Taipei.

According to South China Morning Post, the annual survey, which polled 1,211 Taiwanese adults in September, found that only 34 per cent agreed that the US is trustworthy, maintaining the same level as the previous year when it fell from 43.4 per cent in 2021.

Yet as American credibility remained stable, more than 50 per cent did not deem the US “trustworthy” in the survey of 1,211 Taiwanese adults conducted in September, although China fared significantly worse.

Analysts attribute this skepticism to the unfolding events in Ukraine and how the US government responded to Russia’s invasion.

“We suspect that the drop may have come from the occurrence of the Ukraine war and how the United States government responded,” South China Morning Post quoted Hsin-Hsin Pan, a member of the survey team at Taipei’s Soochow University, as saying.

“Washington’s handling of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine indicates to many Taiwanese how the US might respond if Beijing were to engage in armed conflict with the island,” Pan added.

Despite the mixed views on the US, perceptions of China were consistently negative.

Only 9.3 per cent of respondents considered China “trustworthy,” a slight decrease from last year’s 9.4 per cent and 13.5 per cent in 2021. China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has asserted its intention to reunite it with the mainland, even if force is necessary.

While the US does not officially recognise Taiwan as an independent country and adheres to a one-China policy, the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 legally binds Washington to “provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character” and maintain the capacity to resist any form of coercion.

President Joe Biden has reiterated the US commitment to intervene militarily should China use force against Taiwan.

The survey also indicated strong support for American arms sales to Taiwan, with over 65 per cent of respondents expressing approval. Approximately 57 per cent believed that the US would use force to assist Taiwan if Beijing attempted to unilaterally change the status quo.

The findings highlight a notable gap between the overall credibility of the US and the credibility of its security commitment to Taiwan. Analysts emphasise that more people are willing to assign credibility to the US security commitment to Taiwan than to the US overall.

Regarding the question of whether Taiwan and China belong to the same country, about 78 per cent of those polled rejected this idea.

Notably, more than 50 per cent of Kuomintang party members or supporters, who generally favor closer ties with Beijing, also asserted that Taiwan and China are not part of the same country. This suggests a disconnect between the KMT party stance and the beliefs of its support base.

As Taiwan approaches its presidential election scheduled for January 13, the political landscape is becoming increasingly complex.

The election is expected to focus on local health and welfare issues, as well as relations with Beijing and the island’s sovereignty.

With regional tensions rising, the outcome of the election is seen as a potential turning point for the island’s future relations with China and the United States. The winning party will play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of these relationships amidst evolving geopolitical challenges.

EN_UA_015880.txt,Other,Other,"Wagner to leave Bakhmut by June 1, transfer control to Russian army Bakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed iy 

 The Wagner mercenary group’s head Yevgeny Prigozhin has announced that he will withdraw his troops from Bakhmut by next month and transfer control to the Russian army. The announcement comes just two days after he claimed that the troops have successfully captured the key Ukrainian city.

The claims were however refuted by Kyiv who said that it is hanging on to a corner of the eastern Ukrainian city and that battles are ongoing.

“Wagner will leave Artemovsk from May 25 to June 1,” Wagner boss Yevgeny Prigozhin said in an audio recording on Telegram.

Bakhmut was previously known as Artemovsk to honour a Soviet revolutionary before Ukraine renamed it.

Before planning the transfer of control, Prigozhin readied troops on the western outskirts of the city.

He said, “If the ministry of defence does not have enough personnel, we have thousands of generals.”

Prigozhin has poured scathing criticism on Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and army chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov, accusing them of being incompetent and causing Moscow’s large-scale losses in the conflict in Ukraine.

Wagner fighters have spearheaded Russia’s storming of Bakhmut and Prigozhin’s influence has risen hugely during Moscow’s Ukraine offensive.

The Russian military claimed on Saturday that it has successfully captured the much-contested eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut.

The Wagner Group led the all-out offensive in the city. Earlier in the day, Prigozhin said that his troops had finally pushed the Ukrainians out of the last built-up area inside the city.

The Russian defence ministry said in a statement, “As a result of offensive actions by Wagner assault units, supported by artillery and aviation of the Southern Group of Forces, the liberation of Artyomovsk has been completed.”

“Vladimir Putin congratulated the assault units of Wagner as well as all servicemen of units of the Russian armed forces who provided them with the necessary support and flank cover, on the completion of the operation to liberate Artemovsk (the Soviet-era name for Bakhmut),” TASS agency quoted the Kremlin saying.

EN_CC_200278.txt,Other,Other,"Armistice Day and the Empire: A Name Change and the Catastrophe that Followed 

 In 1954, the US Congress renamed Armistice Day to Veterans Day. The stated reason was to remember all generations of US veterans, not just veterans from the First World War. Congress advanced this rationale on the disingenuous notion that Armistice Day’s purpose was a celebration of veterans. It was not. Armistice Day’s purpose was to serve as a reminder of the horrors of the First World War and carry forward the declaration of those veterans of Never Again.

For a US government implementing a militarized Cold War foreign policy in 1954, a reconciliation-based holiday was inconvenient and problematic. A holiday celebrating veterans would present no critique of war or advocacy of peace; it would do the opposite. As we have seen repeatedly since 1954, Veterans Day and other aspects of “support the troops” rhetoric have been used to shout down dissent towards American wars in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq and suppress criticism of America’s massive overseas military empire and gargantuan Pentagon budgets. The veneration of veterans, almost always obligatorily referred to as heroes, became quasi-deification. In my life, I have seen my military service elevated to near clerical levels, reflecting a pseudo-religious treatment of America’s military caste, best exemplified by the reflexive and ritual-like statements of “thank you for your service.” The political calculus behind the name change was correct.

The militarized foreign policy of the Cold War did not just remain when the Cold War ended but became turbo-charged. The results of that militarized foreign policy have been disastrous for US national security and worldwide stability. The tremendous suffering of entire nations of people, as well as American veterans and their families, cannot be overstated.

Our celebration of war that accompanies each annual Veterans Day is reflected yearlong through our politics, news media, Hollywood, and education system. The consequences of this militarization do not stop with the death and destruction from the instability and wars but include the growth of a ravenous military-industrial complex, a Leviathan, at the expense of our economy and society. With 60% of the federal discretionary budget going to the Pentagon, military contractors and to pay the costs of past wars, the opportunity costs to American communities who are told there is not enough money for healthcare, education, environmental protection and other needs are severe.

That change from Armistice Day to Veterans Day in 1954 signaled a conversion of the American government and its purposes. While the US was an empire before the Second World War, the victory in 1945 created an America that was The Empire. We have been reaping the consequences of that transformation ever since.

Imagine what would be now if, rather than policies derived from a jingoistic narrative of good wars and honorable slaughters, we had preceded with the wisdom of those men from 1918 and followed their admonition of Never Again. Returning to Armistice Day would not simply restore the holiday’s original name but would signal a commitment to peace, stability, prosperity, and hope for future generations. As we endure veteran suicide epidemics, bear a hollow economy and fragile communities, witness our government direct and contribute to the great and unholy carnage in Africa, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe, and recognize the twin existential catastrophes of nuclear war and climate change, what Armistice Day can represent does not sound simply aspirational but entirely necessary.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],armistice day empire change catastrophe follow congress rename armistice day veteran day state reason remember generation veteran veteran world war congress advance rationale disingenuous notion armistice day purpose celebration veteran armistice day purpose serve reminder horror world war carry forward declaration veteran government implement militarize cold war foreign policy reconciliation base holiday inconvenient problematic holiday celebrate veteran present critique war advocacy peace opposite see repeatedly veteran day aspect support troop rhetoric shout dissent american war vietnam afghanistan iraq suppress criticism america massive overseas military empire gargantuan pentagon budget veneration veteran obligatorily refer hero quasi deification life see military service elevate near clerical level reflect pseudo religious treatment america military caste well exemplify reflexive ritual like statement thank service political calculus change correct militarize foreign policy cold war remain cold war end turbo charge result militarize foreign policy disastrous national security worldwide stability tremendous suffering entire nation people american veteran family overstate celebration war accompany annual veteran day reflect yearlong politic news medium hollywood education system consequence militarization stop death destruction instability war include growth ravenous military industrial complex leviathan expense economy society federal discretionary budget go pentagon military contractor pay cost past war opportunity cost american community tell money healthcare education environmental protection need severe change armistice day veteran day signal conversion american government purpose empire second world war victory create america empire reap consequence transformation imagine policy derive jingoistic narrative good war honorable slaughter precede wisdom man follow admonition return armistice day simply restore holiday original signal commitment peace stability prosperity hope future generation endure veteran suicide epidemic bear hollow economy fragile community witness government direct contribute great unholy carnage africa middle east eastern europe recognize twin existential catastrophe nuclear war climate change armistice day represent sound simply aspirational entirely necessary
EN_UA_000543.txt,Other,Other,"Ukraine Appeals for Calm, Says Russian Invasion Not Imminent 

 A top Ukrainian official has appealed for calm as he reassured the nation that an invasion from neighboring Russia was not imminent—despite officials acknowledging there is a real threat as NATO allies have ramped up defenses in the Baltic Sea region this week.

Oleksii Reznikov, Ukraine’s Minister of Defense, said on Monday that at this time, “there are no grounds to believe” that Moscow is preparing an invasion very soon and there is no need for citizens “to have [their] bags packed.”

“Don’t worry, sleep well,” he said, adding that “there are risky scenarios. They’re possible and probable in the future,” though at this time “such a threat doesn’t exist.”

On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also told the nation that the situation is “under control,” while Reznikov affirmed Russia had not formed what he called battle groups, “which would have indicated that tomorrow they could launch an offensive.”

Reznikov’s and Zelensky’s statement in a bid to project calm in order not to destabilize the situation and avoid panic comes as another multi-million dollar shipment of U.S. military equipment arrived in Ukraine on Tuesday.

“Our partners are increasing the amount of military assistance. And today we are meeting the third aircraft from the United States government as part of this assistance,” the defense minister said at a press briefing before the aircraft loaded with defensive aid totaling about $200 million landed at an airport in the capital of Ukraine.

Moscow has repeatedly denied intentions to invade Ukraine, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying the West is showing “hysteria” and is putting out information “laced with lies.”

Peskov on Tuesday again accused the U.S. of “fomenting tensions” around Ukraine, a former Soviet state that has been locked in a conflict with Russia for almost eight years.

Western concern over Moscow planning an invasion of its neighbor started after tens of thousands of Russian troops massed near the Russia–Ukraine border. In 2014, Russia used its military forces to annex the Crimean Peninsula, a move that drew sanctions from then-President Barack Obama.

BIDEN FAMILY STINKS TO HIGH HEAVENS OF CORRUPTION!

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED!

Ukrainian forces have dropped a bomb near diesel tanks located at Russia’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, management at the facility reported on Thursday. The blast occurred near tanks containing diesel for backup generators at the Zaporizhzhia facility, according to management.

The plant has backup diesel generators, which kick on when the electricity supply from the power grid is cut off. Its equipment has to be powered continuously to ensure safe operation, even when nuclear reactors are not online. Blackouts have been a regular occurrence for the site since the beginning of the conflict, according to a report by RT.

In a video published on social media, plant director Yury Chernuk pointed to a crater in the ground, which he said had been created by an explosive device dropped from a Ukrainian drone.

Russia has said in the past that a Ukrainian attack is imminent.

Chernuk, noted that it was fortunate that “neither equipment nor personnel were damaged in the attack.”

”Destruction of those tanks or a fuel leak may not only cause a fire but also result in significant loss of diesel reserves. Consequently, the plant’s preparedness for emergencies would be reduced by orders of magnitude,” Chernuk explained. He also noted that Ukrainian forces had targeted the plant days after the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog, rotated observers stationed there. The organization told Russian media that it was aware of the incident, but offered no further comment.

Europe is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.

“Production of the B61-12 nuclear bomb begins,” Sandia National Laboratories announced from the United States. The B61-12, which replaces the previous B61 deployed by the U.S. at Aviano and Ghedi and other European bases, is a new type of weapon. It has a nuclear warhead with four power options, selectable depending on the target to be destroyed. It is not dropped vertically, but at a distance from the target on which it is directed guided by a satellite system. It can penetrate underground, exploding deep to destroy command center bunkers in a nuclear first strike.

The B61-12s, classified as “non-strategic nuclear weapons,” are deployed in Europe — in Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain and probably other countries — at distances far enough to strike Russia. They thus have offensive capabilities similar to those of strategic weapons.

Another nuclear weapon system, which the United States is preparing to install in Europe against Russia, is ground-based intermediate-range missiles. They can also be launched from “anti-missile shield” installations, deployed by the U.S. at bases in Deveselu in Romania and Redzikowo in Poland, and aboard five warships cruising in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and Baltic Sea close to Russia.

That such installations have offensive capabilities is confirmed by Lockheed Martin itself. Outlining the characteristics of the Mk 41 vertical launch system, used in both land and naval installations, it specifies that it is capable of launching “missiles for all missions, both defense and long-range attack, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.” These can be armed with nuclear warheads.

Europe is thus being turned by the U.S. into the front line of a nuclear confrontation with Russia, even more dangerous than that of the Cold War.

Eventually the Kremlin will be forced to understand that the conflict is not a “limited operation.” For Russia to treat it as one is to invite defeat and WW III.

EN_CC_100044.txt,Other,Other,"The bottom-up Brussels green revolution 

 A Belgian region’s environmental and social conditions for research funding offer a possible model for the EU.

By Anthony King

In the EU and Belgian capital Brussels, Barbara Trachte reflects the strengths of a third governmental layer in Europe: its numerous regions.

Trachte is secretary of state of the Brussels-Capital Region responsible for the economic transition and scientific research. The first member of Belgium’s French-speaking Green party to be put in charge of an economic portfolio, she shows the scope for bottom-up EU policy changes.

Setting an example

Trachte helped put in place a Brussels law that, starting in 2024, has made regional subsidies for research organisations, companies, public administrations and civil society conditional on respect for social and environmental standards. She believes the EU should do the same for its €95.5 billion research programme known as Horizon Europe.

‘Sometimes you need a revolution – or at least a mini revolution,’ Trachte told Horizon Magazine.

She said that Europe’s regions have a key role to play in advancing the continent’s transition to a net-zero economy.

With the EU seeking to become climate neutral by 2050 under the European Green Deal, Horizon Europe has placed increasing emphasis on projects to hasten the switch towards clean energy and away from fossil fuels and to ensure the process is socially fair.

Already the third-biggest part of the EU budget, Horizon Europe would have even greater impact on green and social matters across the continent by following the example set by the Brussels-Capital Region.

In a nutshell, €50 million of subsidies granted annually by the region for research and innovation require recipients to respect a do-no-harm principle and have a positive impact on the environment or social equality, according to Stephanie Lepczynski, who is Trachte’s policy adviser.

‘We are showing the way and we hope that this can influence the European Commission by encouraging it to put environmental, social and governance criteria into the eligibility of Horizon projects,’ Lepczynski said at the European Research and Innovation Days event in Brussels on 20-21 March 2024.

Secrets to success

Gender and transborder-cooperation requirements currently in place for EU funding help ensure greater diversity in research teams and produce scientific results that better reflect the make-up of society, according to Lepczynski.

She said that social and environmental conditionality in Horizon Europe would force researchers systematically to check that they’re acting for the common good and help ensure that funding advances EU green and social goals.

Trachte said such conditions will also be merited in the successor programme of Horizon Europe, which runs for seven years through 2027.

‘I wish for the next EU framework programme to decide the same – to have a greater impact and make a bigger contribution to the objectives of the European Green Deal,’ she said.

For Trachte, EU projects can have the most impact where academic, industry, government, civil society and the environment interact.

This is known as the “quintuple helix” approach to innovation. It has led governments increasingly to prioritise public involvement in innovation processes.

‘This ensures that research is rooted in society and geared towards finding solutions to today’s major societal challenges such as climate degradation, growing socio-economic inequalities or democracies,’ Trachte said.

Mission driven

She singled out as particularly important the five Horizon Europe “Missions”: adapting to climate change, fighting cancer, restoring oceans, cleaning up soil and establishing 100 climate-neutral and smart cities by 2030.

‘The five Missions are a very innovative tool to make the societal challenges stand out – in particular the triple crisis of climate, biodiversity and pollution and the health challenges related to it,’ Trachte said.

In Brussels, the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission was notably successful in bringing together regional and local administrations as well as other partners from the private sector.

‘The enthusiasm created behind the Missions has mobilised many different actors,’ Trachte said.

The views of the interviewees don’t necessarily reflect those of the European Commission.

 Much to its evident discomfort, the BBC has been forced to acknowledge the obvious, that for weeks now, the UK’s weather has been unsettled – with widespread rain, cooler temperatures and an autumnal feel.

Without doubt, the broadcaster would prefer us to be roasting in a prolonged heatwave to support its treasured “global boiling” thesis, matching the situation in much of southern Europe, which it reports has been enduring dangerous heatwaves that have seen temperatures top 40ºC and large wildfires.

That we are not frying to order is obviously something that cannot be tolerated without trying to explain away the anomaly, which the BBC attempts to explain away by telling us that the two extremes of weather are linked. Crucially, we are told, “it’s down to where the jet stream is”.

In an appeal to authority, without identifying any specific sources, Esme Stallard, climate and science reporter, with the assistance of all-purpose hack Sean Seddon, tell us that “meteorologists say” the wet and cool weather is due to the position of the jet stream, a core of strong winds sitting about five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface, and which dictate much of the UK’s weather.

The jet stream, we are then told, marks the boundary of cold air to the north in the polar regions and hot air to the south, a contrast which produces pressure differences. And last year, the jet stream was positioned further north, so the UK saw warm and dry weather created by the high-pressure system sitting over the country.

According to these BBC sages, what is different about this month is that the jet stream has been stuck to the south of the UK, meaning its low-pressure system has been bringing cold and wet weather.

This is actually a pretty poor explanation of the meridional flow pattern which has been dominating the weather for a couple of years now, but that is of less concern than the need to tie in the phenomenon with global warming.

And here, the formula used is classic is its dishonesty. “Some scientists think”, we are told, as if that is sufficient authority for what comes next. These wondrously anonymous “scientists” apparently think that higher temperatures due to climate change in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of high pressure and hot weather remaining in place. But that’s it – that’s all we get, followed by the assertion that “global warming means hot temperatures and wetter periods will become more typical for the UK”.

 China shares inclusive development with the world: Former Director-General of UNESCO

Former Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, receives an exclusive interview with People's Daily Online in Beijing, Sep. 10, 2024. (People's Daily Online/Zhang Wenjie).

China's modernization and inclusive development have helped 1.4 billion Chinese people, set examples, and shared experiences with other countries, benefiting the world as a whole, said Irina Bokova, former Director-General of UNESCO.

Bokova, who is also the Honorary Dean of the School of International Organizations at Beijing Foreign Studies University, visited China several times and voiced her appreciation for China's rapid progress over the last several decades, stating that China's tremendous economic, social, and technological advancements have contributed significantly to the experience of the globe. She also noted that through cooperation mechanisms such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, China is fulfilling its obligation to share its inclusive growth with other countries.

""UNESCO and China have together developed many joint activities, partnerships and initiatives, among my most memorable moments was President Xi Jinping's visit to UNESCO a decade ago,"" Bokova told People's Daily Online during an exclusive interview.

In 2014, Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at the headquarters of UNESCO in Paris, laying out his vision of civilization that features diversity, equality and inclusiveness.

""We need to encourage different civilizations to respect each other and live together in harmony while promoting their exchanges and mutual learning as a bridge of friendship among peoples, a driving force behind human society, and a strong bond for world peace,"" President Xi said.

""President Xi's speech about diversity is very important, it shows that though we belong to different cultures, we are all members of one shared community,"" said Bokova.

According to Bokova, China is fulfilling its responsibility to share its success with the rest of the world by promoting collaboration and inclusive development. For example, China was the first developing country to realize one of the UN Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction, making a significant contribution to the global poverty alleviation cause.

""China's commitment, inclusive development, and strong leadership demonstrate to the world that equality and inclusion in society are attainable. This benefits not only the Chinese people, but also other countries around the world,"" added Bokova.

Bokova has also praised China's ""new quality productive forces"". With innovation playing the leading role, new quality productive forces are forces that feature advanced productivity and are free from traditional economic growth modes and productivity development paths. They are defined by high-tech, high efficiency and high quality, and are in line with the new development philosophy.

""It is a very interesting and innovative concept China is taking. I think it is justified because the world and global economy are entering a new phase, and it is critical to use innovation and technology to encourage young people to use all of the potential of science to achieve equality and social inclusion, as well as to address challenges such as climate change and biodiversity loss,"" said Bokova, adding that ""new quality productive forces"" have the potential to reconcile humans with nature while maintaining all of the benefits of technological progress.

EN_UA_002531.txt,Other,Other,"Kyiv's Mayor Says He's 'Ready to Fight' as Russians Continue Kidnappings 

 Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has promised he is ""ready to fight"" following reports of multiple Ukrainian mayors being kidnapped by the invading Russian military.

Ukraine has accused Russian forces of capturing mayors in Dniprorudne and Melitopol in recent days, sparking concerns that additional mayors could be kidnapped next, including the mayor of the country's capital city.

Klitschko, who was a highly regarded world heavyweight boxing champion before entering politics, insisted during a Fox News interview on Monday that any Russian soldiers who hope to capture him would find that their task was ""not easy.""

""I am ready to fight,"" Klitschko said after America Reports host John Roberts asked him about a potential kidnapping attempt. ""This will be not easy to do that ... nobody feels safety in our country right now in this very difficult situation. Everyone [is] ready to fight, ready to defend our city.""

""I am not worried about kidnap,"" he added. ""I am ready to fight, that's why I have weapons, that's why it's my hometown and I want to defend the interest of my citizens, the interest of my home, the interest of my family.""

Ukrainian officials announced the kidnapping of Dniprorudne Mayor Matveev Sergeevich on Sunday, while they said that Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was captured two days earlier. Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.

While commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that ""the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.""

Klitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of ""un-human"" Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.

""War also has rules,"" said Klitschko. ""But Russians [don't] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can't break the mood of the people and that's why they kidnap the mayors.""

""Its actually against all rules,"" Klitschko continued. ""We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.""

Following Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.

""That's what Russia's war against the civilians looks like,"" Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. ""Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure. [A] city bus just got hit by a rocket. Lives are getting lost, that's the war that Russia started.""

According to the Ukrainian government, Monday's Russian strikes on Kyiv also included a missile hitting a nine-story residential building, leaving two dead and three others hospitalized.

Newsweek reached out to the Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C., for comment.

 Boris Johnson to demand Putin ‘steps back from the brink’ in showdown talks TONIGHT before flying to Ukraine tomorrow

BORIS Johnson today demanded Vladimir Putin ""steps back from the brink"" of war to avoid a brutal bloodbath in Ukraine.

At showdown talks TONIGHT the PM will warn the sabre-rattling Kremlin strongman he'll be ""bitterly and bloodily resisted"" if he invades.

Russia has marshalled more than 100,000 troops on the border of Ukraine and is poised to march in.

Mr Johnson - who is flying to Ukraine tomorrow said an invasion would be ""an absolute disaster for the world"".

Speaking in Essex, Mr Johnson said: ""What I will say to President Putin, as I have said before, is that I think we really all need to step back from the brink.

""I think Russia needs to step back from the brink.

""I think that an invasion of Ukraine, any incursion into Ukraine beyond the territory that Russia has already taken in 2014 would be an absolute disaster for the world, and above all it would be a disaster for Russia.""

He said that any Russian invasion would be ""bitterly and bloodily resisted"" by the Ukrainian people.

A Cabinet Minister today said Germany are ""dragging their feet"" on retaliating against Russian aggression towards Ukraine, a Cabinet Minister blasted today.

Treasury Chief Sec Simon Clarke railed against the sluggish EU response - and hailed Brexit for letting Britain swiftly hit back at Vladimir Putin.

The UK is preparing to slam sanctions on banks and oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin to turn the thumbscrews on Russia.

British combat soldiers are unlikely to be sent to fight, with the PM instead preferring to cripple Russian firms.

Mr Clarke said this morning: ""We are very clear that if Russia takes further action against Ukraine, then we will further tighten the sanctions regimes targeting those businesses, and people with the closest links to the Kremlin.

""Brexit Britain is one of the foremost opponents of the actions of the Putin regime and if you look at the EU, it is countries like Germany who are dragging their feet when it comes to the the response to this crisis.

France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou and ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif call on donors and the private sector to urgently provide a total of US$1.5 billion.

NEW YORK, Sept. 23, 2023 At this weekend’s Global Citizen Festival in New York, France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Ms. Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, and Education Cannot Wait Executive Director Yasmine Sherif announced €40 million in new, additional funding from the Government of France.

Education Cannot Wait (ECW) has now mobilized US$870 million toward its 2023-2026 Strategic Plan to reach 20 million crisis-impacted children with the safety, hope and opportunity of a quality education.

“Championing global education and emancipation is an absolute priority for France. The message of the Paris Pact for People and the Planet is that we must all take our part to allow each country to alleviate poverty and tackle climate change,” said France’s Minister of State for Development and International Partnerships, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou. “This includes states, which must support development policies with sufficient resources. For this reason, I am particularly pleased to announce, on behalf of France and President Macron, the allocation of €40 million to support ECW’s actions for the 2023-2026 cycle.”

“With this new bold and generous contribution, France shines as an example for others to follow,” said ECW Executive Director Yasmine Sherif. “We call on government donors, philanthropic foundations, and the private sector to follow suit and join our collective efforts to mobilize a total of US$1.5 billion by 2026 to provide quality education to 20 million crisis-affected girls and boys so they can learn, grow and rebuild their societies.”

Globally, around 224 million children are deprived of a quality education due to armed conflicts, forced displacement, climate-induced disasters and other protracted crises. They need urgent support to fulfil their right to a quality, inclusive education.

Together with strategic partners, ECW has already reached close to 9 million girls and boys in some of the harshest crises around the globe.

While donors are stepping up, the funding gap has actually widened in recent years. Humanitarian appeals for education in emergencies have nearly tripled from US$1.1 billion in 2019 to almost US$3 billion at the end of 2022.

 Putin may ABANDON siege of Kyiv and try to blitz other cities into submission after losing thousands of troops

MAD Vlad Putin may abandon plans to capture Kyiv as countless Russian soldiers would be killed, spooks now believe.

Spies say the death toll of an all-out assault on Ukraine's capital may even be too much for the evil Kremlin tyrant to stomach.

A Western official said: ""An ill-judged ground assault on a city as well prepared as Kyiv, with really determined and committed defenders, would be a fairly costly business.

""And I think there comes a point where even Russia has to count the cost of casualties.

They said Putin's forces were getting ""bogged down"" around the outskirts of Kyiv after suffering ambushes by heroic Ukrainians.

As many as 7,000 Russian troops have been killed in the bloody fighting so far as Putin's battleplan continues to fall apart.

Spies fear the crazed despot could resort to even more brutal firepower that could blow entire cities to smithereens.

A western official said there was ""big concern"" he could create another Grozny, the Chechan city pummelled in the 1990s.

Soldiers fed Putin's lie that they would be welcomed as liberators are struggling to occupy cities because of resistance.

The official said the plan was to ""walk in, decapitate the local leadership and receive the adulation of a welcoming population"".

They added Russia would likely resort to ""brutalise the population"" and ""destroy"" the cities to save face.

Failure to completely capture a single Ukrainian is humiliating Putin who has lost four top generals and has not ""achieved a strategic breakthrough at any point"".

His legendary paratroopers have also been picked off by plucky Ukrainians.

Taras Kuzio, an Associate Research Fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, says dozens of Russian paratroopers were killed in their doomed bid to take Hostomel airport.

Dramatic footage also shows a Russian tank being blown to bits.

EN_UA_300065.txt,Other,Other,"American Defense Contractors Keep Making Billions From Russia–Ukraine War 

 Major U.S. defense contractors such as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin have benefited from Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine, raking in billions of dollars worth of contracts to supply weapons as the United States continues to spend money to assist Ukraine.

Lockheed Martin manufactures high-tech defense systems that have played a major role in protecting Ukrainian cities from bombardment by Russian aerial forces. Washington has already sent 20 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) launchers to Ukraine. The Pentagon also plans to send 18 more HIMARS launchers at a cost of $1.1 billion.

In December 2022, the U.S. Army granted a $431 million contract to Lockheed Martin to produce HIMARS launchers to replenish its stocks as well as restock the supplies of its partners and allies who militarily support Ukraine. In October 2022, Lockheed was awarded a $14.4 million contract to raise the production capacity of the HIMARS launchers to 96 per year from 60.

In November 2022, Lockheed Martin won a $521 million contract to add to U.S. stocks of multiple-launch guided rocket systems, which also are supplied to Ukraine. The company has a positive outlook for its future business prospects.

Raytheon ContractsRaytheon won a $1.2 billion contract from the U.S. Army in November 2022 to deliver six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) batteries to Ukraine.

The contract was a follow-up to an August 2022 contract for a batch of NASAMS batteries. Two batteries have been delivered and deployed in the nation. In the United States, a NASAMS is in place to defend the national capital region from potential air threats.

Raytheon also produces the Stinger and Javelin missiles, both of which have been used in Ukraine. The company received a $624 million contract from the U.S. government for the Stinger missiles.

At a panel forum in December 2022, Raytheon CEO Greg Hayes revealed that the first 10 months of the Ukraine war consumed as many Javelin missiles as Raytheon and Lockheed Martin produced in five years and as many Stinger missiles as the firm produced in 13 years.

During the company’s third-quarter earnings call in October 2022, Hayes said the organization was doing good business.

Washington’s Ukraine SpendingThe United States has so far allocated $113 billion in assistance to Ukraine, of which $24.2 billion has been used for security assistance since the Russian invasion on Feb. 24, 2022.

The massive U.S. spending on the Ukraine war has attracted criticism from some Republicans. Last month, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) argued that those funds could have benefited U.S. citizens.

On Jan. 19, the Pentagon announced $2.5 billion in additional assistance to Kyiv, with plans to send 59 Bradley fighting vehicles, 90 Stryker combat vehicles, and hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],american defense contractor make billion russia ukraine war major u.s defense contractor raytheon lockheed martin benefit russia ongoing war ukraine rake billion dollar worth contract supply weapon united states continue spend money assist ukraine lockheed martin manufacture high tech defense system play major role protect ukrainian city bombardment russian aerial force washington send high mobility artillery rocket system himar launcher ukraine pentagon plan send himar launcher cost billion december u.s army grant million contract lockheed martin produce himar launcher replenish stock restock supply partner ally militarily support ukraine october lockheed award million contract raise production capacity himar launcher year november lockheed martin win million contract add u.s stock multiple launch guide rocket system supply ukraine company positive outlook future business prospect raytheon contractsraytheon win billion contract u.s army november deliver national advanced surface air missile system nasam battery ukraine contract follow august contract batch nasam battery battery deliver deploy nation united states nasam place defend national capital region potential air threat raytheon produce stinger javelin missile ukraine company receive million contract u.s government stinger missile panel forum december raytheon ceo greg hayes reveal month ukraine war consume javelin missile raytheon lockheed martin produce year stinger missile firm produce year company quarter earning october hayes say organization good business washington ukraine spendingthe united states far allocate billion assistance ukraine billion security assistance russian invasion feb massive u.s spending ukraine war attract criticism republican month rep thomas massie ky argue fund benefit u.s citizen jan pentagon announce billion additional assistance kyiv plan send bradley fighting vehicle stryker combat vehicle hundred thousand round ammunition

 Russia on Monday said that there is currently “no basis” to hold an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the US amid the ongoing war between Moscow and Kyiv.

“There is no basis whatsoever for an arms control and strategic stability dialogue with the United States in the face of a total hybrid war being waged against our country … It will be possible to discuss these topics only after the US authorities renounce their openly hostile anti-Russian policy,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a video address to the Moscow Nonproliferation Conference.

Lavrov expressed that efforts to reduce the potential of a conflict between Russia and the US should be “comprehensive in nature” and based on removing NATO’s eastward expansion.

He further said the West is balancing on the “dangerous edge” of a direct military confrontation between nuclear powers, indicating that Moscow is especially concerned that the three nuclear powers in the West are among Ukraine’s main supporters.

“The US-led ‘collective West’ is cynically complementing the deliberate destruction of balanced and equal agreements that do not suit Washington with the promotion of apparently dishonest schemes that would create advantages for the United States,” Lavrov also said.

He argued that the West’s goal is to create a “unilateral military advantage for themselves by setting new limits for nuclear arsenals while formalizing the aggregate Western superiority in the sphere of non-nuclear capabilities,” adding that the US and its allies are enlarging their network of alliances “directed against third countries” to achieve military superiority.

Lavrov went on to say that Russia’s move to revoke the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty last year was a “logical response to the destructive moves by the US and other Western countries.”

“That said, we remain a full-fledged party to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Not so long ago, we completed the formation of our segment of the International Monitoring System. We are ready to return to the issue of its ratification as soon as the US does this,” he said.

The Russian foreign minister also accused the Western countries of “tailoring” the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to their interests.

“We are convinced that to prevent further degradation of the world situation, maintain durable stability and create realistic disarmament, all countries should pool their efforts to upgrade the international security system relying on the principles of multilateralism, equality and indivisibility. This is the only way of reducing interstate conflicts and ensuring real progress in arms control,” he said.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West']",russia say basis arm control strategic stability dialogue russia monday say currently basis hold arm control strategic stability dialogue amid ongoing war moscow kyiv basis whatsoever arm control strategic stability dialogue united states face total hybrid war wage country possible discuss topic authority renounce openly hostile anti russian policy foreign minister sergey lavrov say video address moscow nonproliferation conference lavrov express effort reduce potential conflict russia comprehensive nature base remove nato eastward expansion say west balance dangerous edge direct military confrontation nuclear power indicate moscow especially concerned nuclear power west ukraine main supporter lead collective west cynically complement deliberate destruction balanced equal agreement suit washington promotion apparently dishonest scheme create advantage united states lavrov say argue west goal create unilateral military advantage set new limit nuclear arsenal formalize aggregate western superiority sphere non nuclear capability add ally enlarge network alliance direct country achieve military superiority lavrov go russia revoke ratification comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty year logical response destructive move western country say remain fledged party comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty long ago complete formation segment international monitoring system ready return issue ratification soon say russian foreign minister accuse western country tailor organization prohibition chemical weapon interest convince prevent degradation world situation maintain durable stability create realistic disarmament country pool effort upgrade international security system rely principle multilateralism equality indivisibility way reduce interstate conflict ensure real progress arm control say
EN_UA_014413.txt,Other,Other,"Vladimir Putin’s cyber warfare chief sent sex toys after his email is hacked 

 A top Russian military spy has been bombarded with sex toys after his personal email was hacked.

Ukrainian hackers claim they gained access to Sergey Morgachev's AliExpress account, ordering multiple sex toys and gay pride flags in his name.

The embarrassing hack was intended as ""a symbolic act of moral humiliation.""

Morgachev is Vladimir Putin's Lieutenant Colonel at Moscow's chief intelligence office, the GRU.

It is believed he was in charge of Russia's notorious ""Fancy Bear"" hackers, also known as APT28.

The hackers, who call themselves Cyber Resistance, claimed on Telegram that they had managed to break into Morgachev's email account.

Then, they were able to access personal information such as family photos and scanned documents of people associated with him, according to the open-source intelligence site Info Nampalm.

Referring to Morgachev in a message after the theft, the group said ""a very cool and clever hacker, but... We hacked him"".

The hack is considered to appear ""pretty credible"" by Ukrainian hacking expert Stefan Soesanto, of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich.

Info Nampalm reported that the hack confirmed Morgachev's identity by sifting through stolen personnel files.

Among these was a document that showed him to be a department head in Unit 26165.

The Russian hacker was accused by the FBI of holding the same position in 2018.

He is on the FBI's wanted list for his part in hacking senior US Democrats including Hillary Clinton ahead of Donald Trump's presidential election in 2016.

It is said Morgachev and the GRU ""knowingly and intentionally conspired… to gain unauthorised access into the computers of US persons and entities involved in the 2016 US presidential election,"" according to a federal indictment filed by the Department of Justice.

In the document, he is described by the FBI as an officer in Russia's military spy agency, in a department ""dedicated to developing and managing malware.""

This was said to include the ""X-Agent"" spy software used to hack the DNC.

 Another day, another fatuous ‘fact’ check from Reuters. This time the news agency accuses the Daily Sceptic of “cherry-picking” Arctic sea ice extent data to provide a “misleading” story. Being accused of “cherry picking” by an outfit that funds a course for journalists that encourages them to pick a fruit such as a mango and discuss why it isn’t as tasty as the year before due to climate change is beyond ridicule. Taking lectures on responsible journalism from a Net Zero-obsessed operation that has promoted a course speaker who has suggested “fines and imprisonments” for expressing scepticism about “well supported” science is laughable, if also a tad sinister.

One of the activists called to admonish the Daily Sceptic with a ‘straw man’ argument was Walt Meier, a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, who said: “Comparing two specific years is not an indicator for or against long-term changes”. The Daily Sceptic did not do that. Interestingly, this would appear to be the same Walt Meier whose comments on ”mind blowing” low winter levels of Antarctica sea ice last year made headlines around the world. Meier claimed at the time that it was “outside anything we have seen”. Happily, the Daily Sceptic was able to remind Meier that he had been part of a team a decade ago that cracked open the secrets of early Nimbus weather satellites and found a similar sea ice low in 1966. At the time, Meier commented that the Nimbus data show there is variability in Antarctica sea ice “that’s larger than any we have seen” since 1979.

 by Kurt Nimmo, Kurt Nimmo on Geopolitics:

In the “collective West,” hypocrisy rules the narrative, most recently in regard to the ICC and the “kidnapped” children of Ukraine.

In America, the scurrilous neocon and warmonger propagandist Max Boot weighed in on the meaningless and unenforcible decision to arrest President Putin. Boot’s argument is delusional, but then neocons thrive on lies and delusions.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Propaganda, pure and simple. Boot is an accessory to mass murder, having advocated the invasion of Iraq, the slaughter of over a million Iraqis, and the engineered destruction of their country.

The hypocritical ICC didn’t bother to contrast and compare Putin’s supposed abduction of Ukrainian children to an organized mass kidnapping of Vietnamese children. It was dubbed “Operation Babylift,” ordered by then President Ford, and was conducted at the end of the Vietnam War as the USG evacuated, having lost the war.

The Vietnamese children abducted without permission were described as “orphans,” although many had parents and relatives that were left behind. 3,300 children, described as “infants” (many were older children), were parceled out to families in America, Australia, West Germany, and France.

The “rescue” of these children was an organized act of kidnapping pure and simple, yet in the Land of Amnesia, millions of Americans know nothing about it (or, for that matter, the Vietnam War itself and the brutal destruction of Southeast Asia).

In 1975, a class action suit was filed in San Francisco on behalf of the kidnapped children.

“The suit seeks to enjoin adoption proceedings until it has been ascertained either that the parents or appropriate relatives in Vietnam have consented to their adoption or that these parents or relatives cannot be found,” The Adoption History Project notes. “The Complaint alleged that several of the Vietnamese orphans brought to the United States under Operation Babylift stated they are not orphans and that they wish to return to Vietnam.”

A statement issued on April 4, 1975, by “professors of ethics and religion,” pointed out that many “of the children are not orphans; their parents or relatives may still be alive, although displaced, in Vietnam… The Vietnamese children should be allowed to stay in Vietnam where they belong.”

The operation was celebrated by the corporate media and “Hollywood’s celebrity elite… [and, as a propaganda event] generated a spectacle of celebration and emphasized that the babies were more than just average orphans,” writes US History Scene.

Uncritical acceptance of the Vietnam war orphans did not last long. A variety of American voices that ranged from child psychologists to news reporters to the casual observer soon began asking whether the evacuation served the best interests of the children. This concern followed closely on the heels of criticism over U.S. motivation for the evacuation. Much of this controversy began when the unclear orphan status of some of the children came to light. The government of South Vietnam reluctantly allowed so many children to leave the country only under the condition that those who left would already be in the adoption process. Volunteers processing the children found that not all of them fit into this category of orphan. In the processing centers, some of the children told the volunteers that they were not orphans and had families living back in Vietnam.

Naturally, Operation Babylift is all but forgotten today. It would be counterproductive to the onslaught of USG and ICC propaganda, not directed at the welfare of children, but rather as a crude “informational” device to further turn opinion against Russia’s SMO to denazify and disarm Ukraine and, in addition, prevent NATO from undermining Russian national security.

The Minister of Education, Prof Tahir Mamman said this at the 2023/2024 Pre-departure briefing of Bilateral Education Agreement Scholars to Russia in Abuja on Tuesday. The first batch of students are already on their way to the airport for departure, while the second and third batches would depart on November 15 and November 17 respectively.

Represented by the Director of Universities Education in the ministry, Rakiya Ilyasu, Mamman advised the scholars not to see the opportunity as uncontrolled freedom to do things that would be to their disgrace.

He explained that the country had invested a lot in them and as such required the returns of investment on their return to the country.

“Note that you are few out of thousands who secured this opportunity which you must not take for granted. Your parents and teachers would also be happy with your succor.

“Your selection is part of a broader plan which ensures that brilliant Nigerians, especially those that cannot afford to study programmes that are not readily available in Nigeria, are supported to get necessary knowledge, skills and competence that would be useful in Nigeria’s development agenda.

“I am happy to inform you that in spite of the global economic meltdown, the number of our development partners have increased and many of them now offer scholarship to Nigeria.

“As you prepare to travel out, ensure to uphold and eschew good values, focus on your studies and be a good ambassador of your country,” he said.

The Minister also charged the scholars to always strive to abide by the laws of their host country and as well remember to be their brother’s keeper in their new environment.

“Most importantly, you need to make your presence known to the Nigerian Embassy in Moscow. This is very necessary based on our experiences from Ukraine.

“Your parents are also spending a lot of resources on you. Note that we all expert you return to our dear country at the end of your studies to assist Nigeria to become a better place by contributing your quota to its development, using your new knowledge and skills,” he added.

Also speaking, the Director, Federal Scholarship Board, Asta Ndajiwo said the journey began in November 2022 with applications from thousands of Nigerians which later translated to the nomination of the candidates. Ndajiwo commended the Federal Government efforts especially in the payment of the scholars allowances from September to December.

She also advised the scholars to do away with any extracurricular activities that could take their lives, recalling an incident with previous two scholars who lost their lives while swimming in a pool.

“We regret loosing two Nigerians scholars in Russia in the past that went to swim and in the process got drowned. We don’t want to loose anyone again and so we advise you stay away from water if you cannot swim.

 This aerial photo taken on May 4, 2023 shows a photovoltaic power station of Almaty in Kazakhstan. (Photo by Kalizhan Ospanov/Xinhua)

The BRI has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

BEIJING, Oct. 21 (Xinhua) -- ""On the ten years anniversary we can declare the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) an amazingly successful initiative"", said Erik Solheim, chairman of the Europe-Asia Center, former Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Commending the pioneering role of the initiative in promoting employment and alleviating poverty, Solheim said, ""Nearly 150 countries take part in the BRI and benefit from the investments, trade, technology transfer and people to people contact with China.""

Solheim, former Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, highly appreciated the accomplishments of the initiative in advancing sustainable development.

""China has defeated air and water pollution much faster than any other nation,"" he said, referring to China's Zhejiang province as a world leader in river conservation, and the cities of Hangzhou, Suzhou and Shenzhen as among the world's greenest cities. ""This gives China enormous strength in sharing experiences with other nations.""

The BRI, he said, has contributed very important green rail corridors in Kenya, Ethiopia, Laos and most recently in Indonesia. Overseas BRI projects have been paying much emphasize on local environmental protection, fostering harmonious development of human and nature.

Solheim also spoke positively of China's decision to stop building coal plants overseas, which ""coincide with similar developments in Indonesia, Bangladesh, Kenya and many other nations along the BRI.""

""The BRI is progressively greener, with a massive focus on solar, wind, hydro and green transport. In the future, it will be the world's number one vehicle for green investments,"" he said.

Solheim emphasized the need for increased cooperation between Europe and China, which is ""critical for environment protection, global economic development and world peace.""

He criticized the ""de-risking"" narrative as ""decoupling"" in essence, which is ""a stupid and dangerous way of scoring own goals."" Both de-risking and decoupling will lead to impoverishment and escalate the likelihood of conflict, he said.

""We need to find the right balance between competition and cooperation. This demands a strong and open dialogue between Europe and China,"" said the environmental protection expert.

BUDAPEST—The European Union has “shot itself in the lungs” with ill-considered economic sanctions on Russia, which, unless rolled back, risk destroying the European economy, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday.
Gas supplies to Europe have tightened and fuel costs have soared since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February and subsequent sanctions, leaving countries scrambling to refill storage and diversify supply channels.

The surge in gas and electricity prices forced Orban to curtail a years-long cap on utility prices for higher-usage households on Wednesday, rolling back one of the 59-year-old prime minister’s signature economic policies.

“Initially, I thought we had only shot ourselves in the foot, but now it is clear that the European economy has shot itself in the lungs, and it is gasping for air,” Orban told public radio in an interview.

Orban said Ukraine needed help, but European leaders should reconsider their strategy, as sanctions have caused widespread damage to the European economy without weakening Russia or bringing the months-long war closer to any resolution.

“The sanctions do not help Ukraine, however, they are bad for the European economy and if it goes on like this, they will kill off the European economy,” Orban said. “What we see right now is unbearable.”

“The moment of truth must come in Brussels, when leaders admit they have made a miscalculation, that the sanctions policy was based on wrong assumptions and it must be changed.”
Re-elected in April, Orban said without Wednesday’s curbs, which will trigger a jump in energy costs for households consuming energy above the national average, the entire utility price cap regime would have to be scrapped.

Economists at Morgan Stanley have said the curbs could add 1.5 percentage points to inflation, already at its highest in two decades, further exacerbated by a weak forint.
Before the April ballot, economists estimated the cost of the utility price caps at up to 1.5 trillion forints ($3.71 billion), which along with a raft of measures that helped Orban’s election bid have caused a surge in the budget deficit.

Orban is facing his toughest challenge yet since taking power in a 2010 landslide, with inflation at its highest in two decades, the forint plumbing record lows and European Union funds in limbo amid a dispute over democratic standards.

Orban’s other decision to fast-track legislation to raise the tax rate for hundreds of thousands of small firms this week as part of a broader drive to rein in the ballooning budget deficit has led to several protests in Budapest.

 Russian Plot To Assassinate CEO Of German Arms Giant Dismissed As 'Fake' Intel Story By Kremlin

Top German government and political figures have reacted with outrage to a CNN report alleging that Russian intelligence had plotted to assassinate Armin Papperger, who is the head of Germany's biggest arms company Rheinmetall. The company is among the top European suppliers of 155mm artillery shells, tanks, armored vehicles, and other crucial military equipment to Kiev.

The Kremlin is calling it fantasy and pointing to zero evidence being presented alongside the major accusation. Here's how the bombshell CNN report published late this past week began: ""US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.""

There have been widespread allegations for several months in Western media pointing to an irregular and covert Russian warfare campaign to conduct sabotage missions against European defense and manufacturing companies supplying Ukraine.

The CNN report alluded to these prior stories: ""The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said."" It detailed further that ""The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.""

In recent months, there have been several instances of fires engulfing weapons and ammo manufacturing sites in the UK and on the European continent, some of which we detailed previously. Simultaneously, Russia has been subject of similarly mysterious blazes at defense contractor buildings and companies.

As for the alleged plot to take out the CEO of Rheinmetal, the CNN story is sourced entirely to anonymous intelligence officials, making it impossible to verify at this point, other than taking the word of US, German, and NATO officials.

According to more from the original CNN report, ""When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.""

But Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the allegations as 'fake news': ""It's all presented in the style of another fake story, so such reports cannot be taken seriously,"" he said at the end of the week.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock belatedly appeared to confirm that the German government finds the warnings credible. ""In view of latest reports on Rheinmetall, this is what we have actually been communicating more and more clearly in recent months: Russia is waging a hybrid war of aggression,"" she had told a press briefing at the NATO summit in Washington.

Papperger himself has since described to the Financial Times that German authorities had imposed a ""great deal of security around my person"" - and he's now considered to be the most highly protected private citizen in all of Germany.

Another interesting aspect to the story is the timing: the CNN revelation corresponded precisely to the close of the annual NATO summit in D.C. at a moment Western officials urged the alliance to stay the course on Ukraine, and commit to supplying more weapons for years to come.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],russian plot assassinate ceo german arm giant dismiss fake intel story kremlin russian plot assassinate ceo german arm giant dismiss fake intel story kremlin german government political figure react outrage cnn report allege russian intelligence plot assassinate armin papperger head germany big arm company rheinmetall company european supplier mm artillery shell tank armored vehicle crucial military equipment kiev kremlin call fantasy point zero evidence present alongside major accusation bombshell cnn report publish late past week begin intelligence discover early year russian government plan assassinate chief executive powerful german arm manufacturer produce artillery shell military vehicle ukraine accord western official familiar episode widespread allegation month western medium pointing irregular covert russian warfare campaign conduct sabotage mission european defense manufacturing company supply ukraine cnn report allude prior story plot series russian plan assassinate defense industry executive europe support ukraine war effort source say detail plan kill armin papperger white haired goliath lead german manufacturing charge support kyiv mature recent month instance fire engulf weapon ammo manufacturing site uk european continent detail previously simultaneously russia subject similarly mysterious blaze defense contractor building company alleged plot ceo rheinmetal cnn story source entirely anonymous intelligence official make impossible verify point take word german nato official accord original cnn report americans learn effort inform germany security service able protect papperger foil plot high level german government official confirm berlin warn plot putin spokesman dmitry peskov reject allegation fake news present style fake story report take seriously say end week germany reportedly foil alleged plot moscow assassinate lead german arm manufacturing firm executive rheinmetall ceo armin papperger target pic.twitter.com/tsijvxgu dw news @dwnews july german foreign minister annalena baerbock belatedly appear confirm german government find warning credible view late report rheinmetall actually communicate clearly recent month russia wage hybrid war aggression tell press briefing nato summit washington papperger describe financial time german authority impose great deal security person consider highly protect private citizen germany interesting aspect story timing cnn revelation correspond precisely close annual nato summit d.c moment western official urge alliance stay course ukraine commit supply weapon year come

 During the state visit by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, King [Name] honored K-pop sensation Blackpink with honorary MBEs, acknowledging their role as ambassadors for the COP climate change summit and advocates for the UN’s sustainable development goals, BBC reported.

The King praised Blackpink’s commitment to environmental causes, highlighting their ability to address vital issues while being global superstars. The investiture took place in Buckingham Palace’s prestigious 1844 room, underscoring the significance of this diplomatic exchange with South Korea. Blackpink members—Roseanne Park, Jennie Kim, Jisoo Kim, and Lalisa Manoban—are now honorary members of the Order of the British Empire. The King’s speech underscored the global impact of South Korean popular culture and its ability to captivate imaginations. Despite the King’s admission of a personal lack of familiarity with “Gangnam Style,” a military band surprised onlookers by playing the song during the changing of the guard. The state visit prioritized both serious diplomacy and pageantry, focusing on enhancing trade links and military partnerships.

President Yoon and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak signed a “Downing Street Accord,” outlining plans for a trade deal and collaboration in science, technology, and green energy.

 A Tesla Owner Just Exposed A Sick Secret About Electric Cars…

The left has been preaching global warming, cooling, climate change, and end-of-the-world nonsense since before many of us were born.

In his book An Inconvenient Truth: The Crisis of Global Warming, Al Gore attempted to persuade everyone that the globe was overheating.

Democrats are always negotiating deals that place the United States at a competitive disadvantage with other countries, some of whom are our foes, such as Communist China.

They manipulate children into doing their bidding by convincing them that they only have a few years to live.

For them, it’s a pretty decent racket. However, there is another viewpoint.

Economic observers have long known that there are no free lunches, and perhaps it’s time that electric-car fans did as well.

Leftists extol Teslas and other electric cars as cure-alls for fossil fuels’ woes – even when it comes to something as simple as their tires – but disregard the tremendous environmental damage these vehicles cause.

Brad Templeton, a Forbes contributor, related a story of his electric car tearing through pricey tires at breakneck speed.

Despite praising the many advantages of electric vehicles over traditional internal combustion engines, Templeton admitted that the requirement for tire replacement at short intervals is an inconvenient downside.

“The doozy was needing new tires at around 28,000 miles,” Temple writes in “Electric Vehicle Maintenance Is Super-Cheap, But The Dark Secret Is Tires” from last month.

“That was too early, far before their rated life.”

“One reason for this was a stupid mistake on my part. In the past, I’ve taken my gasoline cars in for regular service, and they were rotating my tires as needed during this service. Not taking my EV in for service, I never got the rotation done. That not only meant the drive tires of my car wore out faster, it also meant I could not make a warranty claim on them. Lesson learned.”

Electric vehicles do incur charges for what is classified as a repair rather than maintenance. Many Tesla 12v batteries have been reported to fail, albeit most are still under warranty. If you chip a windshield, bang a mirror, or get a car burglary, parts for premium cars are always pricey. He admits that neglecting to rotate the tires properly may have been his fault, but he contends that the added weight of his electric car, along with the necessity for high-efficiency, low-noise tires, meant an expensive purchase was always on the horizon. Apart from that, he characterizes the advantages of owning an electric vehicle as a world of guilt-free driving.

Like Pete Buttigieg, who urged average Americans to buy electric cars to avoid high gas costs while ignoring the $56,000 price tag, which has already proven to be a money trap.

Nonetheless, in light of this revelation, it appears that the tradeoff of electric vehicles – fewer environmental impacts for a higher price – is having the opposite effect.

Regular tread replacement will have an impact on the environment, both because of the fossil fuels required to manufacture them and because wear and tear contribute more harmful microplastics to the environment.

Given that modern tires contain petroleum-based plastics, a car tire requires between 7 and 22 gallons of oil to manufacture, according to a National Geographic article.

Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green”? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/iahDDqZRls

Microplastics become embedded in shrimp gills and guts, according to a study conducted by John Weinstein, a professor of physiology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina.

“Somehow, one of these is frowned upon (tar sands), but the other three- cobalt, nickel, and lithium mines (necessary for EV batteries) are “green?” Author Patrick De Haan wrote of the deadly bargain greenies have made with batteries made from land-scarred processes.

While proponents of electric vehicles argue that they are better for the environment, it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a free lunch, and environmental costs are rising faster than ever before.

Brussels has found yet another way to take hundreds of thousands of euros out of European taxpayers' pockets, and it's evident which member state is controlling the EU bubble.

Another session of the European Parliament is behind us and we are one step closer to a European Green Deal. This is what Joachim Brudzinski, MEP for Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, said following this week’s EP debate on the energy performance of EU buildings.

In his view, this is just the latest directive that will result in hundreds of thousands of euros being siphoned off by Brussels from the pockets of Polish and European citizens. The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. „If this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels’s mad ambitions,” the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called „clean energy source” powering Europe’s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.

„As long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border – in Germany, in fact.”

the Polish MEP pointed out.

 U.S., Europe plan for any cutoff of Russian natural gas over Ukraine crisis

U.S. and European officials are coordinating with natural gas suppliers around the globe to cushion the impact if Russia were to cut off energy supplies in the conflict over Ukraine, Biden administration officials say.

The U.S. and its European allies have promised punishing economic and political sanctions if Russia moves its military into Ukraine, but worry about repercussions for Europeans from any such sanctions, including Russia potentially cutting off delivery of its natural gas to Europe at the height of winter.

Putin has deployed roughly 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border for weeks, sparking a diplomatic crisis for Europe and the United States. He denies any intention of invasion.

Any U.S. and European measures against Russia in the event of an invasion “also have consequences for others, including us,” Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said in remarks as part of a lecture series Monday night.

“There’s a cost imposed on everyone,” Blinken said. “But we have done a tremendous amount of work to mitigate any effects of sanctions on those ... imposing them, as well as any retaliatory action that Russia might take.”

Two senior U.S. administration officials separately briefed reporters Tuesday about efforts by Biden’s national security team to deal with any knock-on effects from sanctions. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations.

Western embassies are also moving some of their staff out of Kyiv

If needed, Europe would look to natural gas supplies in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia and the United States. The effort would require “rather smaller volumes from a multitude of sources” to make up for a Russian cutoff, according to one of the officials.

The Biden administration has acknowledged that Russian President Vladimir Putin has high tolerance for the damage to Russia’s economy that would come with sanctions. But officials said the “start high, stay high” approach to penalties that they have told Moscow they would take could influence Putin’s calculations.

One official said sanctions could spur inflation in Russia “in the mid-teens” and even, according to the second official, a deep recession that would not help Putin “win hearts and minds” among his compatriots.

In the U.S., a group representing large industrial energy users and manufacturers that oppose export of U.S. natural gas appeared open to considering an exception for helping Europeans weather any possible cutoff of Russian natural gas.

Ukraine’s leaders are seeking to reassure their jittery citizens that an invasion from neighboring Russia is not imminent, despite a troop buildup.

The group, Industrial Energy Consumers of America, has asked Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to limit exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG. Surging U.S. exports have helped drive up natural gas prices, the group argues.

Paul Cicio, the group’s president, told reporters on Tuesday that his group had not taken a position on how the U.S. should respond to tensions between Russia and Europe over natural gas.

“My own personal view is that if Europe needs gas, the U.S. should be there to supply our allies,″ Cicio said, noting that China is the top recipient of U.S. gas exports.

“Do we have capacity to supply our allies? Absolutely,″ Cicio said. “But maybe we don’t have capacity to ship to China. So we need to be sensitive to the political crisis. It’s a real serious thing.”",EN,['URW: Negative Consequences for the West'],['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire'],u.s europe plan cutoff russian natural gas ukraine crisis u.s europe plan cutoff russian natural gas ukraine crisis u.s european official coordinate natural gas supplier globe cushion impact russia cut energy supply conflict ukraine biden administration official u.s european ally promise punish economic political sanction russia move military ukraine worry repercussion european sanction include russia potentially cut delivery natural gas europe height winter putin deploy roughly troop near ukraine border week spark diplomatic crisis europe united states deny intention invasion u.s european measure russia event invasion consequence include secretary state antony j. blinken say remark lecture series monday night cost impose blinken say tremendous work mitigate effect sanction impose retaliatory action russia senior u.s administration official separately brief reporter tuesday effort biden national security team deal knock effect sanction official speak condition anonymity discuss deliberation western embassy move staff kyiv need europe look natural gas supply north africa middle east asia united states effort require small volume multitude source russian cutoff accord official biden administration acknowledge russian president vladimir putin high tolerance damage russia economy come sanction official say start high stay high approach penalty tell moscow influence putin calculation official say sanction spur inflation russia mid teen accord second official deep recession help putin win heart mind compatriot u.s group represent large industrial energy user manufacturer oppose export u.s natural gas appear open consider exception help european weather possible cutoff russian natural gas ukraine leader seek reassure jittery citizen invasion neighbor russia imminent despite troop buildup group industrial energy consumer america ask energy secretary jennifer granholm limit export liquefy natural gas lng surge u.s export help drive natural gas price group argue paul cicio group president tell reporter tuesday group take position u.s respond tension russia europe natural gas personal view europe need gas u.s supply ally cicio say note china recipient u.s gas export capacity supply ally absolutely cicio say maybe don capacity ship china need sensitive political crisis real thing

 A few globalist-owned and controlled animal feed companies are supplying farmers with tainted chicken feed that allegedly prevent hens from producing eggs, adding to the chaotic food shortages and supply chain breakdowns. Is this another attempt to cripple the entire food supply, including meat and eggs, so everyone will run to the grocery stores and buy genetically-mutated, lab-concocted Franken-meat that Bill Gates funds? It would appear so.

Not only are hens unable to lay eggs for months after consuming globalist-manufactured tainted feed, but could it be possible those chickens and eggs are also toxic for humans to consume, possibly causing infertility issues for them also? Local egg suppliers and farmers are blowing the whistle on what could be the tip of the iceberg when it comes to corporations purposely trying to cripple the meat and egg supplies of this country, driving inflation through the roof.

Ever since October, several American egg farmers have experienced ZERO egg production from their chickens, until they switched their feed to a different kind, some even going with goat feed. Now, suddenly, the chickens are laying eggs again, almost back to the normal rate. What is the explanation? Chickens do produce fewer eggs in the winter due to the shorter daylight hours and molting (shedding of feathers), but they don't usually completely stop laying.

Many of these farmers say the mass media and Big Food are using the avian flu outbreak as a cover story for the egg laying problem, but that still doesn't explain why every chicken had completely stopped laying eggs while on the tainted food regimen. What companies are the farmers pointing the finger at?

Purina's Dumor brand and Tractor Supply's Producer's Pride brand of chicken feed. These are the culprits, and if you follow the money up the line, it leads straight to the corporate gurus and globalists who are urging all humans to stop eating meat and eggs, and start eating grub worms and cockroaches, in order to save the planet from… global warming. Sure. Meanwhile, at the Davos convention, the globalists are all eating salmon and steaks. So, you were saying?

It's now more than obvious there is a deliberate war on food being waged against civilians by the globalists. Centralized suppliers, especially those that supply rural farmers that are mostly Conservatives and Republicans, are obviously out to cripple the egg supply, as strong evidence comes from two particular brands of feed these farmers use regularly.

This tragedy is forcing people to connect the dots and realize that it's not just the hen food that's causing production and infertility problems, but the human food as well. Egg farmers are now on the record saying, “If they are willing to poison my chickens to prevent me from supplying myself or others with eggs, then surely they would poison the food I eat and feed my family.”

There is a massive public awakening happening now, as food prices soar and supplies get choked out. More people are dying right and left from ""unknown causes"" and it's getting worse by the day. People are dropping dead from heart attacks and strokes and many fewer humans have been having babies over the past few years, since the scamdemic began. Coincidence? It's population reduction, and it's a war being waged using food, medicine, viruses, dirty vaccines, and supply chain dismantling.

EN_UA_300018.txt,URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader,URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor,"Ukrainian terrorist hot air balloon shot down over Russia 

 The Russian military shot down a Ukrainian hot air balloon over the Kursk region of Russia. They wanted to use the aerostat to carry out a terrorist attack on targets inside Russia, the Defence Ministry said.

The department noted that on April 16 at about 8:15 a.m., air defence systems shot down a small hot air balloon over the territory of the Kursk region. No other details of the incident were provided.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine used similar aircraft during the special military operation. At the end of March, soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces shot down a ""terrorist balloon”, which was disguised as a probe.

The improvised hot air balloon bombers are equipped with a GPS tracker, flight control equipment, ballast, an explosive device and batteries. Coordinates for dropping the explosives are entered into the navigation controller of the balloon. Externally, the aerostat is disguised as a weather balloon to avoid damage.

The accuracy of such drones is not high for hitting targets on the contact line, so they are used to drop bombs on populated areas.

In February 2023, former Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said that Russia was using balloons with radar corner reflectors to deplete Kyiv's air defence system.

Specially equipped balloons can be used to combat drones, Sergei Bendin, acting head of the Moscow branch of the Aeronautics Commission of the Russian Geographical Society said.

Manned and unmanned airships may carry means of electronic warfare that could protect the military from drones. In addition, balloons and airships can be used for reconnaissance and communications relay.

 FACT CHECK: Did Greta Thunberg Say Saving The Banks Would Save The World?

A video shared on social media purports climate change activist Greta Thunberg said to save the banks in order to save the world.

Verdict: False

This video is missing context. Thunberg was not advocating for banks to “save the world.”

Fact Check:

Thunberg recently pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book festival, BBC reported. The event was sponsored by the company Baillie Gifford and Thunberg refused to appear at the event claiming that Baillie Gifford, “invests heavily in the fossil fuel industry.”

The Facebook post purports Thunberg suggested the way to save the world is to save the banks. The post shared a small clip from an interview with Thunberg in which the audience claps after her alleged statement.

“The money is there if we can save the banks, we can save the world,” she says in the clip. The caption reads, “GRETA – Saying the quiet parts out loud. The only way to save the planet is to save the banks.”

The clip is taken out of context. Check Your Fact conducted a reverse image and found the clip stems from a conference called, ‘The Right to a Future’ held by The Intercept.

The interviewer asks Greta about her rebuttal to governments saying fighting climate change is “too expensive.” The full exchange features Thunberg arguing that world governments have enough money to help curb climate change suggesting if there is “enough money to bail out the banks, then there is enough money to help the environment.” (RELATED: Did RFK Jr. Meet With Then-President Trump To Lead A Vaccine Safety Commission?)

There is no credible news report that suggests she was making this claim or had recently made such a remark.

A company that makes fake meat won nearly $1.5 million from the Biden-Harris Department of Defense.

“The Better Meat Company, based in West Sacramento, California, was awarded $1.48 million to plan a bioproduction facility for mycoprotein ingredients that are shelf-stable, have high protein and fiber contents, and can be dehydrated,” the Pentagon announced.

The August grant comes just a month after the Pentagon announced it would no longer explore ways to feed troops “lab-grown meat,” following backlash in the media and from the beef industry.

A Pentagon spokesman repeated part of the news release in a statement to The Daily Wire and said the product will not be used in Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), a durable food package given to troops.

“We are investing in sources of protein such as chickpeas and tofu. The Department is not funding research into ‘lab-grown’ or ‘fake meat’ – nor does it have plans to include such protein substitutes in service members’ MREs,” the spokesman told The Daily Wire for an article earlier this week.

However, there is a connection between “mycoprotein” and the fake meat. The Daily Wire reported:

The grant will, however, fund a “facility for mycoprotein ingredients,” the same exact ingredient used to create the fake meat. The Daily Wire asked the Defense Department if these facilities will be used by the Better Meat Company to create fake meat during or after the grant term, but has not received a response.

Fake meat has been a favored tool of globalist elites and “climate change” activists because it ostensibly creates less pollution than cattle ranching, although that claim is questionable.

“Within current frameworks, governments can create clear, supportive, agile and efficient regulatory processes to ensure safe and transparent pathways that instill confidence in consumers and industry players alike, fostering a robust alternative protein market in a shift towards food systems that are more sustainable, secure and just,” a World Economic Forum report claimed.

The push for “alternative protein[s]” is to help countries reach the Paris Agreement’s radical environmentalist goals.

University of Southern California researchers also released a paper in August of this year detailing ways to encourage people to eat less red meat and testing the effectiveness of terms like “climate change” and “climate justice.”

As LifeSiteNews reported at the time:

The paper ultimately found that a willingness to eat less red meat fell along partisan lines, with Democrats being more eager to deny themselves the nutrient dense food, which is chock full of vitamins and proteins that aid in muscle growth. Republicans, on the other hand, were “often unresponsive” to changes in terminology.

The paper concludes that “climate change communications may therefore need to go beyond terminology.” It recommended that “effective communication strategies include using compelling everyday language, presenting clear graphs, emphasizing social norms, and making climate-friendly actions the default.”

The researchers said “conservative spokespeople” could be recruited to push Republicans to embrace the “climate change” agenda.

At the same time, some states have begun fighting back against the intrusion of lab-grown meat into grocery stores and onto kitchen tables.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation in May of this year that bans the sale of lab-grown meat in the state of Florida. It is being challenged in court.

“While the World Economic Forum is telling the world to forgo meat consumption, Florida is increasing meat production, and encouraging residents to continue to consume and enjoy 100% real Florida beef,” a news release stated at the time.

Gov. DeSantis said the Sunshine State was “fighting back against the global elite’s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals.”

“Our administration will continue to focus on investing in our local farmers and ranchers, and we will save our beef.”",EN,"['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement']","['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Blaming global elites', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist']",fake meat company receive million pentagon company make fake meat win nearly million biden harris department defense well meat company base west sacramento california award million plan bioproduction facility mycoprotein ingredient shelf stable high protein fiber content dehydrate pentagon announce august grant come month pentagon announce long explore way feed troop lab grow meat follow backlash medium beef industry pentagon spokesman repeat news release statement daily wire say product meal ready eat mre durable food package give troop invest source protein chickpea tofu department fund research lab grow fake meat plan include protein substitute service member mre spokesman tell daily wire article early week connection mycoprotein fake meat daily wire report grant fund facility mycoprotein ingredient exact ingredient create fake meat daily wire ask defense department facility well meat company create fake meat grant term receive response fake meat favor tool globalist elite climate change activist ostensibly create pollution cattle ranch claim questionable current framework government create clear supportive agile efficient regulatory process ensure safe transparent pathway instill confidence consumer industry player alike foster robust alternative protein market shift food system sustainable secure world economic forum report claim push alternative protein[s help country reach paris agreement radical environmentalist goal university southern california researcher release paper august year detail way encourage people eat red meat test effectiveness term like climate change climate justice lifesitenew report time paper ultimately find willingness eat red meat fall partisan line democrat eager deny nutrient dense food chock vitamin protein aid muscle growth republican hand unresponsive change terminology paper conclude climate change communication need terminology recommend effective communication strategy include compelling everyday language present clear graph emphasize social norm make climate friendly action default researcher say conservative spokespeople recruit push republican embrace climate change agenda time state begin fight intrusion lab grow meat grocery store kitchen table florida gov ron desantis sign legislation year ban sale lab grow meat state florida challenge court world economic forum tell world forgo meat consumption florida increase meat production encourage resident continue consume enjoy real florida beef news release state time gov desantis say sunshine state fight global elite plan force world eat meat grow petri dish bug achieve authoritarian goal administration continue focus invest local farmer rancher save beef

 The Met Office has been unable to back up a claim that storms in the U.K. are “more intense” due to the effects of climate change. The claim was made by senior Met Office meteorologist Claire Nasir on January 22nd on BBC 5 Live Breakfast in the aftermath of Storm Isha, and led to a freedom of information request for an explanation by investigative journalist Paul Homewood. The Met Office has replied that it is unable to answer the request due to the fact that the information “is not held”.

In fact the Met Office could have addressed the claim that storms are growing in intensity by referring to its own ‘State of the Climate 2022’ report:

The most recent two decades have seen fewer occurrences of maximum gust speeds above these thresholds [40/50/60 knots] than during previous decades, particularly comparing the period before and after 2000. This earlier period [before 2000] also included among the most severe storms experienced in the U.K. in the observational records including the ‘Burns Day Storm’ of January 25th 1990, the ‘Boxing Day Storm’ of December 26th 1998 and the ‘Great Storm’ of October 16th 1987. Any comparison of storms is complex as it depends on severity, spatial extent and duration. Storm Eunice [in 2022] was the most severe storm to affect England and Wales since February 2014, but even so, these storms of the 1980s and 1990s were much more severe.

An explanation for the remarks broadcast unchallenged on the BBC was provided by the Met Office, “in order to provide advice and assistance”. The statement about more intense storms being due to climate change was, the Met Office explains, in reference to “our published U.K. Climate Projections, looking at projections in the future”. This is straight out laughable, since it seeks to justify a statement firmly in the present with waffle about future modelled projections. Paul Homewood comments that it is “small wonder that so many have little confidence in the Met Office anymore”. Meanwhile, the Global Warming Policy Foundation has demanded that the Met Office retracts the “false ‘more intense storms’ claim”. The foundation notes that there is no compelling trend in maximum gust speeds recorded in the U.K. since 1969.

Of course these remarks by Claire Nasir are just the latest in a long line of scares that are being spread by state-funded operations promoting the collectivist Net Zero project. In the mainstream media there is little or no push back on often outrageous and improbable claims of climate collapse and potential future human misery.

In December, the headlines were full of the news that London could suffer an endemic dengue plague by 2060 due to changes in the climate. The claim from the Health Security Agency arose from a computer model fed with an implausible rise in temperature of 3-4°C within 80 years. Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, called the claims “entirely fictional” and “shameless”. Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch commented that science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. “This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute,” he said.

 Consumers and businesses urged to use a brown bin

Consumers and businesses are being urged to use a brown bin, recycle their food waste and reduce their carbon footprint, following National Food Waste Recycling Week, which ran from June 2-9.

New research of over 1,000 adults found that over two thirds of all householders in Ireland currently use a brown bin and, of those who do, helping climate change is their top motivation.

However, a recent study from the Environmental Protection Agency found that, in commercial general waste bins, 30% of the contents are food waste; while in household general waste bins, 17% of the content is food waste, meaning this food waste will never be recycled.

“We’ve made great progress in Ireland with over two thirds of people now using a brown bin but, as we see from the research, there is still a high proportion of food waste that could be recycled going into our general waste bins,” said Pauline McDonogh, Resource Efficiency Officer at MyWaste.ie

“The introduction of new legislation means everyone, everywhere in Ireland with a kerbside waste collection service is now entitled to a brown bin service. We’d urge everyone – consumers and businesses – if you don’t use a brown bin, please start, and make a positive change for our environment,” she added.

In Ireland it’s estimated we waste about 750,000 tonnes of food each year. Food waste that ends up in landfill is a significant contributor to climate change – food waste is estimated to generate up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing food waste has both environmental and financial benefits.

The brown bin service accepts all types of food: Raw and cooked meat and fish, plate scrapings, and fruit and vegetable peelings, in addition to food-soiled paper napkins, paper towels, greasy pizza boxes, and light garden waste.

 The president of Russia said on Friday the United States and its NATO allies have ignored Moscow’s security demands, while a top Kremlin official said Russia does not want a war.

“There won’t be a war as far as it depends on the Russian Federation, we don’t want a war,” Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during an interview with local radio stations. “But we won’t let our interests be rudely trampled on and ignored.”

During the call, Putin said he wants to continue dialogue with the West to negotiate a stalled peace agreement for eastern Ukraine between Russia, Ukraine, France, and Germany. Presidential envoys from the four countries already met in Paris on Wednesday and agreed to another meeting in Berlin in two weeks.

The latest diplomatic move also comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday called on the West not to create “panic,” challenging U.S. warnings about an imminent Russian attack.

“I don’t consider the situation now tenser than before. There is a feeling abroad that there is war here. That’s not the case,” Zelensky told reporters at a Friday press briefing. “We don’t need this panic,” he added.

Zelensky’s comment comes one day after rumors spread that President Joe Biden warned him during a phone call that Kyiv would soon be “sacked” in an invasion by Russian military forces.

“He has previously said this publicly and we have been warning about this for months. Reports of anything more or different than that are completely false,” she said.

Meanwhile, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko also ruled out that there will be war, saying there will not be a war unless Belarus or Russia comes under attack.

“The leaders of some countries have gone mad, they think they can win that war,” Lukashenko said. “But there will be no victory, we will all lose.”

Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told parliament the number of Russian troops near Ukraine—which amounts to about 130,000—is comparable to Moscow’s military buildup last spring, when Moscow eventually pulled its forces back after massive exercises.

“We haven’t observed any events or actions of military character that significantly differ from what was going on last spring,” with the exception of the deployment to Belarus, Reznikov said.

While Moscow and the West are mulling their next steps, NATO said it was bolstering its deterrence in the Baltic Sea region, and the United States ordered 8,500 troops on higher alert for potential deployment to Europe.

Russia has launched military drills involving motorized infantry and artillery units in southwestern Russia, warplanes in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea, and dozens of warships in the Black Sea and the Arctic. Russian troops have also headed to Belarus for sweeping joint drills, again raising Western fears that Moscow could stage an attack on Ukraine from the north.",EN,['URW: Amplifying war-related fears'],['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other'],putin say nato ignore security demand kremlin rule war ukraine president russia say friday united states nato ally ignore moscow security demand kremlin official say russia want war win war far depend russian federation don want war foreign minister sergey lavrov say interview local radio station win let interest rudely trample ignore putin say want continue dialogue west negotiate stall peace agreement eastern ukraine russia ukraine france germany presidential envoy country meet paris wednesday agree meeting berlin week late diplomatic come ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky friday call west create panic challenge u.s warning imminent russian attack don consider situation tenser feeling abroad war case zelensky tell reporter friday press briefing don need panic add zelensky comment come day rumor spread president joe biden warn phone kyiv soon sack invasion russian military force previously say publicly warn month report different completely false say belarusian leader alexander lukashenko rule war say war belarus russia come attack leader country go mad think win war lukashenko say victory lose ukrainian defense minister oleksii reznikov tell parliament number russian troop near ukraine amount comparable moscow military buildup spring moscow eventually pull force massive exercise haven observe event action military character significantly differ go spring exception deployment belarus reznikov say moscow west mull step nato say bolster deterrence baltic sea region united states order troop high alert potential deployment europe russia launch military drill involve motorized infantry artillery unit southwestern russia warplane kaliningrad baltic sea dozen warship black sea arctic russian troop head belarus sweep joint drill raise western fear moscow stage attack ukraine north

Dear President Trump!

My name is Faina Savenkova. I am a teenager living in Donbass. I am 15 years old, and I am a young writer and journalist. However, the Ukrainian government sees me just as one of many civilian targets in this war. In my short life, I have had to endure the horrors of war due to the weapons that Western countries supply to Ukraine. I know that there was recently an attempt on your life. I am very glad that the perpetrator did not succeed because human life is the greatest gift given to us by God. But the deadly threat that you face is the threat that the children of Donbass face every day at the hands of Ukraine’s extremist government.

July 27th is the Day of Remembrance for the Children Victims of the War in Donbass. On July 27, 2014, the Ukrainian military launched a massive artillery strike on Horlivka, resulting in the deaths of 22 civilians, including children. Yes, the war in Ukraine began in 2014. Since then, the aggression of the Ukrainian authorities and army towards the civilians of Donbass has only intensified, which is why we want to live in the safety Russian Federation. The list of deceased children is only growing, as they continue to die due to the ambitions of adults. This must be stopped as soon as possible.

In one of your speeches to American voters, you said that you want to make America great again. Mr. Trump, the greatness of a country depends not only on the amount of weaponry it supplies to other countries, such as Ukraine, but also on whether this country can stop supplying those weapons that kill innocents. President Biden started the war in Ukraine, and now every day, hundreds of Ukrainians die on the battlefield. You may not consider yourself a friend of Russia, but I am sure that you can help bring this conflict to a speedy end. I also hope that Russia and the United States can establish a dialogue for the sake of mankind's future and the entire planet.

 Energy giant Centrica is prepared to do the right thing, small beer though it looks

Hope on bills

AT last one energy giant is prepared to do the right thing, small beer though it looks.

Centrica’s grants of £250 to £750 for customers least able to pay their monstrous new gas bills are welcome.

But they still won’t make much of a dent.

No surprise there when the firm is donating only ten per cent of the profits from its British Gas arm.

That’s a negligible fraction of Centrica’s soaring total: £1.34billion in just six months this year.

It can do so much more.

Read More on Energy Bills

But at least it is doing something.

More than can be said of Shell and BP, making scandalously vast war profits since Putin strangled the oil supply.

Those who still oppose the windfall tax in these truly exceptional circumstances should think again.

Bar Russians

WHY should Russians be free to holiday in Britain, or Italy, or the South of France?

We and the EU should ban new visas now.

No, it’s not fair on those opposed to Putin.

But many of them fled Russia months or years ago.

Depressing surveys show huge support among the remaining population for Putin’s genocide.

It is delusional to imagine those are all inaccurate.

Ordinary Russians seem mostly behind wiping Ukraine and its people off the map.

Our Defence Secretary Ben Wallace wants only to tighten visa rules to bar the families of oligarchs and Kremlin goons.

But we should go further, as Ukraine’s President Zelensky says.

Russians who can prove they have publicly opposed Putin can request asylum.

The rest must know they are not welcome to travel to Europe while their country is still butchering its neighbour.

We must do everything we can to turn them against their murderous dictator.

Block heads

BRITAIN is being suffocated by a culture of obstructionism which stops anything getting done while simultaneously seeking to regulate our lives and crush pleasure.

Thanks to NIMBYs, we can’t build enough homes or power plants, nor approve a single reservoir, nor extract shale gas crucial to our energy security.

The Lib Dems are shamefully proud to champion all campaigners against progress.

Similarly, in Whitehall, their left-liberal civil service soulmates enjoy thwarting any radical ideas for change.

Meanwhile the same group obsessively plot to dictate what ordinary people can eat and drink — and even whether to allow us a harmless flutter.

A new “study”, funded by your money, urges a ban on gambling ads and sponsorship — plus intrusive checks on punters’ bank accounts.

Why? Because a truly tiny proportion of the population, 0.2 per cent and falling, is addicted.

EN_UA_010735.txt,Other,Other,"Russia's Infrastructure Attacks Could Impact Ukraine's Neighbors: Official 

 Russia's latest attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure could impact the Eastern European nation's neighbors, a key Ukrainian energy official said on Tuesday.

Nearly nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow has continued to ramp up its attacks against Ukrainian infrastructure in recent weeks, targeting cities across Ukraine including the capital city of Kyiv.

Despite the vast size of the Russian military, its troops have struggled to achieve substantial gains in Ukraine. Meanwhile, throughout the fall, Kyiv has retaken control of formerly occupied territories, most recently recapturing control of Kherson, a major city in the nation's southern region.

Concerns about attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure have grown as winter approaches, and these attacks threaten to leave millions of Ukrainians without power throughout the winter, which could see dangerously low temperatures.

On Tuesday, Russia hit Ukraine with its latest attack on its infrastructure, which Ukraine's Energy Minister German Galushchenko described as the ""most massive shelling"" since the war began on February 24, 2022.

""Today again Russia strikes large-scale missile strikes on energy facilities. This is the most massive shelling of the energy system since the beginning of the war,"" he wrote in a Facebook post. ""This attack can have an impact not only on the energy system of Ukraine, but also on the energy systems of some of our neighbors.""

Galushchenko said the attack hit Ukraine's generators and electricity transmission system, describing the attack as ""another attempt of terrorist revenge"" in which Russia tried to ""inflict maximum damage on our energy system on the eve of winter.""

One Ukrainian neighbor reported outages due to the attack.

Moldovan Minister of Infrastructure and Regional Development Andrei Spînu wrote in a Telegram post that the Russian attacks led to power outages across the country. The lines did not suffer damage due to the attack but were disconnected due to a safety measure.

""As a result of Russia's bombing of the Ukrainian energy system in the last hour, one of the power lines that provide electricity transport for our country was disconnected in automatic mode (automatic load shedding according to frequency). This has led to massive power outages across the country,"" he wrote.

Moldovan authorities restored power for most of its residents later Tuesday, but Spînu warned that Russian attacks against Ukraine could lead to further outages.

""Russian aggression against Ukraine directly affects our country as well. The risks of power outages remain high. Any bombing by Russia against Ukrainian power plants may lead to a repeat of today's situation,"" he wrote.

Newsweek reached out to the Ukrainian Ministry of Energy for comment.

 Unfortunately, a new poll shows that the majority of Americans believe to some extent the unscientific climate doom propaganda that has been consistently wrong for half a century. The good news: most Americans still oppose ditching fossil fuels and gas cars altogether.

Pew Research Center published the results of its new survey on June 28. While climate alarmists’ predictions have been consistently and wildly wrong for 50 years now, with one unscientific claim after another proven false, the media, government, and institutions continue pounding in the narrative — and with some apparently considerable effects:

- 74% of Americans say they support the country’s participation in international efforts to reduce the effects of climate change.

- 67% of U.S. adults prioritize the development of alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and hydrogen power over increasing the production of fossil fuel energy sources.

I have previously explained in more detail how “green” energy is actually toxic for the environment, besides being inefficient and unprofitable. In other words, “green” energy is a lose-lose option. Solar panels and wind turbines have killed billions of birds, for instance, and offshore wind turbines can be deadly for whales (not to mention, wind turbines and solar panels generate plenty of toxic waste). And those “green” electric vehicles (EV)? EV batteries, which have to be replaced every few years, are very toxic to manufacture and dispose of.

Perhaps Americans are starting to realize that:

[Pew:] Less than half of the public (40%) favors phasing out the production of gas-powered cars and trucks. Support for this policy is 7 percentage points lower than it was two years ago. And underscoring the strong feelings big changes to American life can engender, 45% say they would feel upset if gas-powered cars were phased out; fewer than half as many (21%) would feel excited.

You mean Americans don’t want to switch to unreliable electric cars that have to depend upon an already strained grid? No way!

If Pew is to be believed, however, Americans are a little too credulous of the narrative that carbon is about to make this planet into a ball of fire. (Spoiler: it isn’t):

- 76% favor providing a tax credit to businesses that develop carbon capture technologies and 70% support taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions.

- 61% favor requiring power plants to eliminate all carbon emissions by the year 2040

One very simple truth that the climate alarmists don’t want you to know is that carbon is absolutely essential for life on Earth. Indeed, increased carbon actually helps plants — including food crops — thrive. Human, plant, or animal, we need carbon. So drastically reducing carbon could hurt humans and devastate crops and plants.

By the way, a recent study found that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are too low to cause global warming. That seems like important information, but don’t expect to see it in the mainstream media.

It is disappointing that so many Americans believe to some degree in the climate hoax after all these years. But it is encouraging that Americans are not falling hook, line, and sinker for some of the lies around electric vehicles and fossil fuels.

We don’t need to give up our cars to save the planet. It’s all just a political deception.

 Large numbers of foreign leftists have been killed by Russian missiles in Ukraine after posting selfies on Reddit that disclosed their location.

 Bad luck for solar panel owners and users, and anything relying on photosynthesis. But as such umbrellas would be far too heavy to move even if they could be made, probably nothing to worry about. Just another climate alarm concoction in search of funding.

– – –

A team of climate scientists wants to launch enormous umbrellas into space to reduce the Earth’s exposure to the sun and fight climate change, The New York Times reported Friday (via Climate Change Dispatch).

The underlying idea is that large parasols could be positioned in space such that they marginally reduce the intensity of sunlight the Earth receives and thereby mitigate some global warming, the Times reported.

To block out enough radiation, a single sunshade would need to be approximately the size of Argentina — nearly one million square miles — and would weigh about 2.5 million tons, so scientists are looking to prove the idea could work by first producing a 100-square foot prototype with the help of $10 to $20 million of funding.

Dr. Yoram Rozen, a physics professor and the Asher Space Research Institute’s director at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, is leading the team of scientists pushing the idea, according to the Times.

Because the Argentina-sized umbrella would be too large to feasibly launch into space, his team is hoping to build a set of smaller shades that would diffuse the intensity of the radiation reaching the planet.

“We can show the world, look, there is a working solution, take it, increase it to the necessary size,” Rozen told the Times.

Rozen and his team are still designing the prototype, but they anticipate that they could build it within about three years once they get the required funds [Talkshop comment – of course], according to the Times.

A full-sized product would cost trillions of dollars, and that expense would likely have to be picked up by many countries (i.e., their taxpayers), Rozen told the Times.

American Interventionism Is Dangerous,

But Is It Worse than the Alternative?

I’ve been here before, only I didn’t know it. When I born in the summer of 1984, the world had already escaped nuclear holocaust on a number of occasions, but the biggest close calls happened in the early 1980s, with one of them so close to a Soviet-American thermonuclear war that the Soviet officer who de-escalated the event is dubbed “the man that saved the world” – Stanislav Petrov.

Like all incredible lucky stories, Stanislav was called to duty at the last second, because the officer originally assigned to the shift was sick.

Suddenly, his screen was filled with notices of nuclear warheads headed to the Soviet Union from the United States, and he had to decide whether or not to call Moscow ASAP and alert them that in five minutes, the entire country would be obliterated!

But something stopped him… he began reasoning that had the United States started on the path of nuclear war, they’d launch hundreds of missiles, not just a few, and decided to hold off and learn that no other station was reporting anything.

Subsequently, he learned that this was a new satellite detection system that was totally useless, and that even flares from the clouds and sun could make it beep.

Basically, he found out that the latest Soviet air defenses were garbage and was actually fired, instead of hailed for his deep thinking.

I was born the year after Stanislav Petrov saved the world, including my own parents.

Now, the Russians and NATO members are fighting a proxy war in Ukraine. France is ready to send troops to Ukraine already and, instead of having the country join NATO, it will essentially turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between Russia and the rest of Europe, but president Biden, of all people, is the one blocking it.

No wonder precious metals are soaring, but do I agree with hedge fund managers that it is overvalued?

Courtesy: Zerohedge.com

In my opinion, gold is not overvalued, and its fair price is in the neighborhood of $2,582, whereas silver’s is around $37.

In the next few weeks, Biden will realize that France entering Ukraine, while showing that Washington is playing second fiddle to an emerging superpower in Europe. Washington stands to gain much from this, as it will drastically shift from policing the world to coalizing with other nations and keeping its influence, while isolating more and more, which is a very bi-partisan strategy.

If this happens, a head-on confrontation between France and Russia will send the human race back to the WW2 era, and I submit to you that French troops will then be reinforced by German, Polish and Italian ones.

Ukraine, in effect, will be like the Berlin Wall, separating Russia from Europe proper.

If you’re shaking your head in disbelief, just know that during Carter’s term in office, a 40c-worth chip malfunctioned once, prompting the screens to show that 2,000 Soviet warheads were en route to major American cities. Only five minutes later, when Carter was about to be notified and we were minutes away from launching a counterstrike, the operations room called to say it was a faulty chip!!!

Yeah, own silver… it’s going higher.

 Moscow: Russia will ask the UN Security Council for an investigation into Nord Stream gas pipelines explosions in September last year for which it blames the US.

The Russian parliament’s committee for international relations has introduced the motion regarding this and is expected to get approval by the State Duma later this week.

What does the proposal say?

According to a report by TASS, the proposal calls the Baltic Sea pipelines blasts as “an act of international terrorism” and a “monstrous sabotage.""

It seeks from the United Nations to hold accountable both - who gave the order for the explosions and those who carried it out.

“The criminal act has threatened the security of all Eurasia,” the proposal stated.

Giving the reference to the report of American investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, the lawmakers blamed US President Joe Biden’s administration, saying it “gave the illegal order and bears full responsibility for the multi-billion-dollar damage to the infrastructure of Russia, Germany, France and the Netherlands.""

Don’t Miss: US planted explosives along Nord Stream gas pipelines in 2022 under Biden supervision, claims Seymour Hersh

They further described the pipeline sabotage as inflicting long-term damage to the security, economy and environment of the entire region.

Hersh in his report alleged that the Nord Stream gas pipelines were damaged in a joint operation between the US and Norway.

US actions require “a thorough international investigation, punishment of those responsible and compensation for the damage caused,” the proposal said.

What Seymour Hersh’s report say?

Last week, Hersh in over 5,000 words report claimed that “top secret and highly-dangerous operation” was carried out by the divers during BALTOPS22, a series of military exercises in the Baltic Sea carried out by 16 NATO countries.

According to him, divers trained at the US Navy’s Diving and Salvage Centre in Florida, planted C4 explosives on three Nord Stream pipelines in June 2022. They were detonated after three months using a sonar buoy which broadcast a signal that triggered the bombs.

He further claimed that the Nord Stream attack was carried out in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.

Explosions in Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were reported on 26 September, 2022, an attack that, ostensibly, continues to puzzle investigators.

 by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:

Though Western ‘news’ media have gotten their ‘explanation’ of this event from Ukraine’s Government, it never made sense that Russia would have wanted to flood, harm, and weaken, the entire western half of the territory that Russia now controls in the former Ukraine, including in Crimea (which was getting its water-supply from that dam).

The anonymous author of the “Moon of Alabama” website has a long and almost flawless record of accurately exposing realities that mainstream U.S.-and-allied ‘news’-media had been hiding, and the latest such is his June 13th “Did Russia Destroy The Nova Kakhovka Dam?” His report there turns upside-down and inside-out the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ that the dam had been bombed not by a missile, but by an explosive device which had been placed there by saboteurs whom Ukraine’s Government assumes were from Russia. U.S.-Government-approved ‘news’-media accept and amplify that assumption, but “MoA” does not.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

First, he quotes the New York Times and other U.S. Government mouthpieces presenting the Ukrainian Government’s ‘explanation’ of the blow-up; and then he rips it apart by noting the extremely relevant (but in U.S.-and-occupied lands ignored) fact, that on May 12th, Britain had supplied to Ukraine its “Storm Shadow” missiles that are designed to have a two-stage bombing-operation: first, a normal surface bomb, but then after it a fuse-ignited ground-penetrating bomb to explode deeper inside even a fortified and hardened underground target such as that dam was apparently blown up.

The British-supplied Storm Shadow weapon is perfect for this type of destruction — exploding from deep underground, instead of from the surface. And whereas Russia doesn’t have any Storm Shadows, Ukraine definitely does — ever since May 12th.

The present news-report about U.S.-and-allied lies is being simultaneously submitted for publication by all of the standard U.S.-Government mouthpiece propaganda-media, just in case any of them might finally want to go beyond their standard U.S.-Government-approved sources.

Ever since at least late 2022, Russia has been warning that Ukraine’s government wants to blow up that dam. For example, on 1 November 2022, Reuters headlined “Russia announces wider evacuation of occupied southern Ukraine”, and reported that,

“Due to the possibility of the use of prohibited methods of war by the Ukrainian regime, as well as information that Kyiv is preparing a massive missile strike on the Kakhovka hydroelectric station, there is an immediate danger of the Kherson region being flooded,” Vladimir Saldo, Russian-installed head of occupied Kherson province, said in a video message.

“Given the situation, I have decided to expand the evacuation zone by 15 km from the Dnipro,” he said. “The decision will make it possible to create a layered defence in order to repel Ukrainian attacks and protect civilians.”

Moscow has accused Kyiv of planning to use a so-called “dirty bomb” to spread radiation, or to blow up a dam to flood towns and villages in Kherson province. Kyiv says accusations it would use such tactics on its own territory are absurd, but that Russia might be planning such actions itself to blame Ukraine. …

Saldo, the Russian-imposed occupation leader for the province, identified seven towns on the east bank that would now be evacuated, comprising the main populated settlements along that stretch of the river.

 RAMSTEIN AIR BASE - Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin promised Tuesday that the United States will not let Ukraine fail in fighting off Russia, even as further aid remains stalled in Congress and Kyiv’s forces face shortages of munitions.

The Republican-led House of Representatives has been blocking $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine and the United States has warned that a recent $300 million package would only last a few weeks.

The “United States will not let Ukraine fail”, Austin said at the opening of a meeting in Germany of Ukraine’s international supporters, at which he is seeking to secure further assistance for Kyiv.

“We remain determined to provide Ukraine with the resources that it needs to resist the Kremlin’s aggression,” he said. Washington announced $300 million in assistance for Ukraine last week, but Austin said it was only possible due to savings on recent purchases.

“We were only able to support this much-needed package by identifying some unanticipated contract savings”, Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a statement the day before that it is “critically important for us that the Congress soon completes all the necessary procedures and makes a final decision” on aid for Kyiv.

Top US military officer General Charles “CQ” Brown told journalists en route to the Ukraine meeting that Kyiv’s troops are “having to pay attention to their supply rates and how they execute.” There is an “incremental kind of back and forth between Ukraine and Russia”, with “incremental gains on both sides”, Brown said.

But he noted that “even as the Russians have gained territory, they do it at a pretty big cost in number of casualties, like in personnel, but also in number of pieces of equipment that are being taken out.”

Austin said in his remarks Tuesday that “Russia has paid a staggering cost for (President Vladimir) Putin’s imperial dreams”, using “up to $211 billion to equip, deploy, maintain, and sustain its imperial aggression against Ukraine.”

“At least 315,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded” since Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Austin said, adding that Ukraine has also “sunk, destroyed, or damaged some 20 medium-to-large Russian navy vessels.”

The sinkings have been an embarrassment for Moscow and Russian state media confirmed Tuesday that the country had replaced the head of its navy. Austin and other US officials have spearheaded the push for international support for Ukraine, quickly forging a coalition to back Kyiv after Russia invaded and coordinating aid from dozens of countries.

Speaking at the Ramstein US base, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin has offered another half a million euros worth of military aid to Ukraine. “That includes 10,000 rounds of ammunition from the stock of our armed forces,” he told journalists. Germany is Ukraine’s second biggest donor of military support, after Washington, which has committed tens of billions of dollars to aid Kyiv since February 2022.",EN,"['URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",washington let ukraine fail defence chief vow ramstein air base defense secretary lloyd austin promise tuesday united states let ukraine fail fight russia aid remain stall congress kyiv force face shortage munition republican lead house representative block billion assistance ukraine united states warn recent million package week united states let ukraine fail austin say opening meeting germany ukraine international supporter seek secure assistance kyiv remain determined provide ukraine resource need resist kremlin aggression say washington announce million assistance ukraine week austin say possible saving recent purchase able support need package identify unanticipated contract saving austin say ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky say statement day critically important congress soon complete necessary procedure make final decision aid kyiv military officer general charles cq brown tell journalist en route ukraine meeting kyiv troop have pay attention supply rate execute incremental kind forth ukraine russia incremental gain side brown say note russians gain territory pretty big cost number casualty like personnel number piece equipment take austin say remark tuesday russia pay staggering cost president vladimir putin imperial dream billion equip deploy maintain sustain imperial aggression ukraine russian troop kill wound russia launch invasion ukraine austin say add ukraine sink destroy damage medium large russian navy vessel sinking embarrassment moscow russian state medium confirm tuesday country replace head navy austin official spearhead push international support ukraine quickly forge coalition kyiv russia invade coordinate aid dozen country speak ramstein base german defence minister boris pistorius say berlin offer half million euro worth military aid ukraine include round ammunition stock armed force tell journalist germany ukraine second big donor military support washington commit ten billion dollar aid kyiv february

 Is the U.S. experiencing record heat this summer? Nope. That’s just the propaganda that the climate alarmists would like you to believe. But Marxists often use global warming as an excuse to restrict liberties and confiscate property rights.

Data that hasn’t been manipulated by climate alarmists shows that this summer hasn’t seen a record heatwave across the U.S. There is no climate crisis, no man-made climate Armageddon, so why keep pushing the narrative? Because it’s a wonderfully self-righteous veneer for greedy, tyrannical, freedom-hating Marxism. Don’t fall for the propaganda, but be vigilant. The most vocal climate alarmists have a hidden — and dangerous — agenda.

For instance, the Biden administration doesn’t promote toxic “green” energy or target gas stoves and gas-powered vehicles to save the planet. These are schemes to make money or make citizens poorer and less independent.

Chris Martz of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow’s (CFACT) posted data on June 26 to explain that evidence does not support the “record heat”/global warming claim:

Despite claims from the climate spin doctors that last week's heatwave was “unprecedented,” not one state set a new “all-time” high temperature record… A total of 39 states recorded their “all-time” June high temperature records thirty or more years ago. Of those 39, 31 were set prior to 1960 and 28 prior to 1950. Six states recorded their June “all-time” record highs each in 1934, 1936 and 2012, while five were set each in the years 1919, 1931 and 1994.

The Desert Southwest has yet to see a heatwave that is as intense as that of late-June 1994. In the historical record, it remains unmatched.

As someone living in the Desert Southwest, I can add my personal vouch that we’re not experiencing record heat even within my memory. But by ginning up all this climate hysteria, leftists hope to control people’s minds and actions. The woke activists who glue themselves to streets, splash paint over historic monuments, and swear not to have children because of “global warming” are brainwashed lackeys of Marxist elites. Their life goals are all defined by politicians instead of by their jobs, their families, and their friends.

Loving ‘Humanity,’ Hating Humans: Dostoevsky and Leftists’ False ‘Virtue’

And if people are afraid, as climate propaganda is meant to make them, they are a great deal easier to control and more likely to agree with the government assuming dictatorial powers. By the way, I don’t believe the propaganda is quite as effective as leftists would like, but fear is certainly their goal. As the insidious and climate fearmongering World Economic Forum (WEF) put it, you will “own nothing, have no privacy” and enjoy it — or else. Forget the facts that increased carbon is beneficial for plants and warming makes ecosystems thrive — Marxists have a dystopia to establish!

No major climate prediction has come true in over 50 years. The lies are more ridiculous today than they were half a century ago, but they are still dangerous. We might not be facing our ultimate doom from global warming, but we could be looking at a major dystopian push from Western, especially U.S., leadership that will fundamentally transform our lives.",EN,"['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Climate change is beneficial', 'CC: Climate change is beneficial', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science']","['CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Other', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Climate cycles are natural', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Climate change is beneficial: CO2 is beneficial', 'CC: Climate change is beneficial: Temperature increase is beneficial', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Other']",record heat lie marxist machination u.s experience record heat summer nope propaganda climate alarmist like believe marxist use global warming excuse restrict liberty confiscate property right datum hasn manipulate climate alarmist show summer hasn see record heatwave u.s climate crisis man climate armageddon push narrative wonderfully self righteous veneer greedy tyrannical freedom hate marxism don fall propaganda vigilant vocal climate alarmist hidden dangerous agenda instance biden administration doesn promote toxic green energy target gas stove gas power vehicle save planet scheme money citizen poor independent chris martz committee constructive tomorrow cfact post datum june explain evidence support record heat /global warming claim despite claim climate spin doctor week heatwave unprecedented state set new time high temperature record total state record time june high temperature record thirty year ago set prior prior state record june time record high set year desert southwest heatwave intense late june historical record remain unmatched live desert southwest add personal vouch experience record heat memory gin climate hysteria leftist hope control people mind action woke activist glue street splash paint historic monument swear child global warming brainwash lackey marxist elite life goal define politician instead job family friend love humanity hate human dostoevsky leftist false virtue people afraid climate propaganda mean great deal easy control likely agree government assume dictatorial power way don believe propaganda effective leftist like fear certainly goal insidious climate fearmongere world economic forum wef privacy enjoy forget fact increase carbon beneficial plant warming make ecosystem thrive marxist dystopia establish major climate prediction come true year lie ridiculous today half century ago dangerous face ultimate doom global warming look major dystopian push western especially u.s leadership fundamentally transform life

Russian units have been carrying out successful offensive operation in the Kupyansk sector amid the inability of forces of the Kyiv regime to achieve any declared tasks and objectives of their ‘counter-offensive’ in Zaporozhye and South Donetsk. Earlier, Russian detachments also made a series of tactical advances south of Adeevka and in the area of Marrinka in the countryside of Donetsk.

These developments on the frontline took place amid the long-expected death of the grain deal under the shelter of which the Kyiv regime and its sponsors used the Odessa port infrastructure for military purposes. 

Apart from these actions, the West sabotaged the implementation of the part of the deal related to the Russian interests. Therefore, the fate of the deal was de-facto predetermined from its very start. The recent series of massive attacks aimed against the Republic of Crimea and the Crimean Bridge became a logical continuation of this approach.

In such conditions, Russia carried out a series of strikes on military objects placed within the Odessa port infrastructure. 

On July 18, the Russian Armed Forces carried out a group strike with precision sea-based weapons against facilities involved in preparations of attacks with unmanned boats as well as a ship repair plant near Odessa, where these boats were manufactured or at least partly assembled. 

Additionally, storage facilities with a total of about 70,000 tonnes of fuel were destroyed close to Nikolayev and Odessa. These facilities were used to supply fuel for the military hardware of the armed forces of the Kyiv regime. On the next day, on July 19, the Russian military delivered another round of strikes on such targets. E

xplosions were reported in the countryside of Odessa, including the Illichevsk port area where a large fuel storage depot was allegedly destroyed. Other sources claim that strikes also hit positions of Ukrainian air defense facilities in the Radujniy area.

The cost of the Russian withdrawal from the grain deal and strikes on the Odessa port infrastructure for Kyiv and its puppeteers already exceeded any damage suffered by Russia from terrorist attacks aimed against Crimea. 

Nonetheless, NATO HQs demonstrate little ability to draw conclusions from observed reality. On July 19, Crimean authorities shut down a local highway and ordered the evacuation of about 2,200 people from four settlements in the east of the peninsula. The decision was made after an ammunition depot in the area close to the evacuated villages “caught fire”. 

Reports say that the fire was caused by a strike launched by the Kyiv regime. NATO-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were allegedly employed. 

By such actions, NATO and Kyiv have been consistently pushing Russia to the long-delayed but needed decisions regarding the elimination of military infrastructure in Odessa and nearby areas.

 Warmer winters bringing earlier blooms and earlier bugs, experts say

BALTIMORE -- If you enjoyed the extra sunshine and hotter temperatures this winter season, then enjoy the sweet fragrance of cherry blossoms blooming early.

But brace yourself for the early arrival of bugs.

Washington D.C's famous cherry blossoms tend to be the go-to indicator that Spring is here.

Mike Litterst with the National Park Service and National Mall said after experiencing the third warmest winter on record in the DC area, the cherry blossoms could bloom as early as March 22nd to March 25th.

""But it was so warm this year,"" Litterst said. ""It's complicating things a little bit.""

Normally, the blossoms are inactive during the winter. But the warmer temperatures this season are kicking off the blooming period earlier.

""We're seeing, if you will, some confusion in the trees about this,"" he said. ""Our primary indicator tree is showing four different stages of the bloom process depending on which branches you're looking at.""

But blossoms are not the only visitors that may pay us a visit sooner rather than later.

""This could turn out to be a very buggy year,"" University of Maryland Professor Emeritus of Entomology Michael Raupp said.

Michael Raupp, otherwise known as ""The Bug Guy,"" said with blossoms expected to open two weeks sooner, we can expect to see more pollinators.

""The honeybees are busy,"" Raupp said. ""The carpenter bees are out looking for pollen sources right now.""

Though you may be tempted to show a little more skin because of the warmer weather, mosquitoes will be out in full force. So, have some extra bug spray on hand.

""At the temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit, it will take mosquitoes about two to three weeks to develop but at 90 degrees Fahrenheit they're going to do it in one week,"" Raupp said. ""That means we will have twice as many generations in the same amount of time.""

A spike in ticks is also a concern as it could lead to lime disease and red meat allergies.

Raupp said if you spot a tick on your body after a hike remove it in the first 24 hours. Then, wash your clothes and dry them for half an hour to kill any remaining ticks.

""The bugs that have been just hanging out there just waiting for a little warmth, hey guess what, they got it in spades right now,"" he said.

Maryland's growers are also facing some challenges because of the early heat.

""We're already hearing reports from our growers around the state that the Alfalfa Weevil, which is an important pest on certain crops and usually doesn't appear for several weeks, is actually active now and beginning to create damage on our forage crops,"" he said.

However, Raupp and Litterst say because of climate change all these changes are not surprising and may just become our new norm.",EN,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],warm winter bring early bloom early bug expert extra sunshine hotter temperature winter season bring downside expert ago warm winter bring early bloom early bug expert baltimore enjoy extra sunshine hotter temperature winter season enjoy sweet fragrance cherry blossom bloom early brace early arrival bug washington d.c famous cherry blossom tend indicator spring mike litterst national park service national mall say experience warm winter record dc area cherry blossom bloom early march nd march th warm year litterst say complicate thing little bit normally blossom inactive winter warm temperature season kick bloom period early see confusion tree say primary indicator tree show different stage bloom process depend branch look blossom visitor pay visit soon later turn buggy year university maryland professor emeritus entomology michael raupp say michael raupp know bug guy say blossom expect open week soon expect pollinator honeybee busy raupp say carpenter bee look pollen source right tempt little skin warm weather mosquito force extra bug spray hand temperature degree fahrenheit mosquito week develop degree fahrenheit go week raupp say mean twice generation time spike tick concern lead lime disease red meat allergy raupp say spot tick body hike remove hour wash clothe dry half hour kill remain tick bug hang wait little warmth hey guess get spade right say maryland grower face challenge early heat hear report grower state alfalfa weevil important pest certain crop usually appear week actually active begin create damage forage crop say raupp litterst climate change change surprising new norm

 Make no mistake - the West wanted Russia to invade the Ukraine.

Make no mistake - the West wanted Russia to invade the Ukraine.

They goaded Russia into it deliberately, then abandoned Ukraine for all intents and purposes.

It’s part of their plan to bring the entire world down so they can build it up again in their image.

Russia is going to attack the USA.

Again, this is what the West wants.

The entire show fits in with their demonic vaccination operation.

The Russian attack will finish what the vaccinations and the sanctions started

This is the work of mad people.

This is the work of Satan.

The West represents human civilization at its peak.

And war is part of the plan to reverse that.

Putin has stated that being cut off from Swift is equivalent to a nuclear attack.

The consequence of which must entail a retaliatory nuclear attack.

That is the conclusion we must read into that statement.

Part of the reason for attacking Ukraine was to get rid of the nazis and junkies.

The USA is the symbolic embodiment of both.

The problem for Russia is the Antichrist not Biden.

He it is who is behind the vaccinations, degeneracy, economic implosion, religious sellout and finally nuclear war.

If I am aware of him I’m sure, as Prince Charles of England has hinted, others are aware of him as well.

Not sure but I believe most Western leaders are as well, having signed up to the genocide via voluntary injection.

His next objective is mandatory injection and for that they need sprawling camp detentions everywhere.

Once detained these people will be subjected to torture then killed as they do not fit into their plans.

Western leaders have already fallen and unless they are forcefully replaced by the popular vote they are the central core of the satanic plan unfolding like clockwork.

However by taking out the USA, the rest of Europe will fold to Putin and the tough threats will not be ignored and the Antichrist will be defeated.

America will still survive but it will be freed from demonic entrapment with the intent to enslavement.

It will again become a light to the world for the Statue of Liberty was and always will be a symbol of that light.

 The science of climate change often is presented in complicated language that speaks of computer models and the theoretical inputs and outputs thereof and concludes that the globe is on the verge of “boiling.” Well, leave it to three physicists -- steeped in calculus and such arcane matters as the behavior of molecules and the nuclear charge of atoms -- to simplify the analysis and arrive at a much less alarming determination.

“Straightforward calculations … show that eliminating U.S. CO2 emissions by the year 2050 would avoid a temperature increase of 0.0084 degrees Celsius,” states a brief paper authored by Drs. Richard Lindzen, Massachusetts Institute of Technology; William Happer, Princeton University; and William A. van Wijngaarden, York University, Toronto. On the Fahrenheit scale, the value of averted warming is 0.015 ◦F degrees.

In short, the amount of warming averted by eliminating CO2 emissions in the United States would be too small to measure. The paper bolsters the position of those who argue that a changing climate is the product of natural forces, that human-induced carbon dioxide emissions can have only a minuscule effect on global temperature, and that CO2 is a valuable plant food and not a pollutant.

Rather than using theoretical assumptions about various factors that are fed into computers, the paper’s calculation relies almost exclusively on “observable data” that are widely accepted and publicly available, says Dr. Happer.

“This is something anybody with a calculator can figure out,” said the scientist, who may be best known for his contribution to a laser-based technology for destroying incoming ballistic missiles as part of the so-called Star Wars program of the 1980s.

The data needed for the math are the number of years until 2050, the amount of carbon dioxide being added to the atmosphere, which scientists regularly measure, and the current concentration of atmospheric CO2, which is approximately 427 parts per million as of June 2024.

The only assumed datapoint is the sensitivity of the atmosphere to CO2 increases. The paper uses a value almost the same as one commonly used “before global-warming alarmism became fashionable.” Even if the value is quadrupled to a number favored by the politically driven Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the amount of warming averted still is only 0.034 degrees Celsius.

So, what if the entire world eliminated carbon dioxide emissions from the activities of mankind? Since U.S. emissions account for 12% of global output, the answer lies in the math to determine the remaining 88%. The paper’s calculation is that the amount of warming averted would be 0.07 degrees Celsius. Using the higher IPCC sensitivity value, the number quadruples to 0.28 degrees Celsius. Both are still inconsequential and certainly not worth destroying the world economy.

Noting that others using different approaches have come to conclusions similar to the paper’s, Dr. Happer said he and his coauthors wanted to show that the controversial subject of climate change need not be complicated.

“More members of the public should understand that they are being victimized by false information disseminated by those whose interests have more to do with money and power than with environmental concerns,” he said. “Answers found in relatively simple mathematics strongly suggest this to be the case.”

 Is EU kowtowing to Germany's interests?

Brussels has found yet another way to take hundreds of thousands of euros out of European taxpayers' pockets, and it's evident which member state is controlling the EU bubble.

Another session of the European Parliament is behind us and we are one step closer to a European Green Deal. This is what Joachim Brudzinski, MEP for Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party, said following this week’s EP debate on the energy performance of EU buildings.

In his view, this is just the latest directive that will result in hundreds of thousands of euros being siphoned off by Brussels from the pockets of Polish and European citizens. The directive includes a ban on gas boilers by 2025. „If this is not an example of a particular kind of ecological madness, or even idiocy, then there are other examples of Brussels’s mad ambitions,” the PiS politician said. The directive would also stipulate that all new buildings must be zero emission by 2030. He believes this is ideological madness, best exemplified by the fact that until the war in Ukraine, gas was the so-called „clean energy source” powering Europe’s largest economy. Brudzinski also pointed out that it is clear who controls Brussels and whose will and interests prevail in EU actions.

„As long as Germany had Nord Stream with Russia, gas was fine. When Nord Stream was stopped, suddenly the Germans realised that gas was fossil energy and they were already saying we should move away from gas. And what should we switch to? Heat pumps. Where will these pumps be manufactured? Well, new factories are already mushrooming along the German-Polish border – in Germany, in fact.”

the Polish MEP pointed out.

With the help of left-wing politicians in Poland, the European Parliament’s liberal majority has voted in favour of a proposal which would make everyone living in a family house today pay tens of thousands of euros out of their own pocket to implement a policy that will result in some economies growing, while others are being sidelined. The vice president of the Law and Justice Party explained that no European funding had been provided to implement the directive.

 This Bill Gates startup makes butter from air that tastes ‘like the real thing'

Bill Gates-supported startup, Savor, pioneers dairy-free butter with minimal environmental impact

RA California-based startup claimed that it has been successful in making butter which is dairy-free and tastes just as good. Savor, backed by the Microsoft founder Bill Gates, said that its experiments with creating diary-free alternatives to ice-cream, cheese, and milk have produced a new animal-free butter alternative. This has been made by utilising a thermochemical process that allows it to build fat molecules, creating chains of carbon dioxide, hydrogen and oxygen.

Savor said that its products will have a significantly lower carbon footprint than animal-based ones as the “butter” comes in at less than 0.8g CO2 equivalent per kg. In contrast, real unsalted butter with 80% fat has a standard climate footprint of 16.9kg CO2 equivalent per kg.

Kathleen Alexander, Savor’s chief executive, said, “We are currently pre-commercial and working through regulatory approval to be able to sell our butter. We are not expecting to be able to move forward with any kind of sales until at least 2025. So far, we had informal taste panels with tens of people. We expect to perform a more formal panel as part of our commercialisation and scale-up efforts.”

 NEW YORK—An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program to protest the war in Ukraine was released from custody Tuesday and fined about $270, but still could face a prison sentence.

Marina Ovsyannikova told reporters she was not allowed to sleep while held in police custody and that she was interrogated for 14 hours.

Ovsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked behind the presenter during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.

In a video recorded earlier, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”

The state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video and remains under investigation for the on-air protest under a law banning dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces. The new law carries a maximum 15-year prison sentence.

Ovsyannikova, whose father is Ukrainian and her mother Russian, spent the night in police custody.

“These were very difficult days of my life because I literally went two full days without sleep, the interrogation lasted for more than 14 hours and they didn’t allow me to contact my family and close friends, didn’t provide any legal support,” Ovsyannikova said.

 Eight states — California, Rhode Island, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Washington — and the District of Columbia are now on board with plans to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles within the next decade.

The plans to phase out the vehicles and switch to electric and hybrid vehicles come as the Biden administration continues to pursue its lofty climate goals in a struggling economy. The administration, for example, wants half of all new cars and trucks sold in 2030 to be zero-emission, despite sputtering EV sales.

All 8 of the states and D.C. have adopted the Advanced Clean Cars II rule, and will have an outright ban on the sale of new gas-powered vehicles after 2035.

California was the first to adopt the rule, aiming to have 35% of new vehicle sales emit zero emissions by 2026, and boosting that goal to 68% by 2030.

According to the California Air Resources Board, the regulation overhauls the state’s “growing zero-emission vehicle market and robust motor vehicle emission control rules and augments them to meet more aggressive tailpipe emissions standards and ramp up to 100% zero-emission vehicles.”

As noted by Money, the states’ plans to ban gas-powered vehicles have generally not required votes from lawmakers, but have been advanced with support from governors and environmental regulators.

The EV market has struggled in recent months, as highlighted by The Daily Wire. Ford, for example, had to cut 1,400 employees from its Rouge Electric Vehicle Center, rolled back the planned production number of the electric F-150 Lightnings in half, and slashed $12 billion in EV investments.

President Biden, however, is not slowing down when it comes to targeting the gas-powered vehicle industry. Earlier this month, Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set new eye-popping regulations in an effort to increase the number of electric vehicles on the road.


The new EPA rules set emission standards for vehicles made between 2027 and 2032 and would eliminate more than 7 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, setting off concerns across the nation.

For example, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) railed against the EPA’s move, calling it both “reckless” and “ill-informed.”

“The federal government has no authority and no right to mandate what type of car or truck Americans can purchase for their everyday lives,” the senator said. “This reckless and ill-informed rule will impose what is effectively an EV mandate without ensuring the security of our supply chains from nations like China and without a realistic transition plan that addresses our domestic infrastructure needs.”",EN,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",state plan ban sale gas power vehicle biden epa tackle climate crisis state california rhode island maryland massachusetts new jersey new york oregon washington district columbia board plan ban sale gas power vehicle decade plan phase vehicle switch electric hybrid vehicle come biden administration continue pursue lofty climate goal struggle economy administration example want half new car truck sell zero emission despite sputter ev sale state d.c adopt advanced clean cars ii rule outright ban sale new gas power vehicle california adopt rule aim new vehicle sale emit zero emission boost goal accord california air resources board regulation overhaul state grow zero emission vehicle market robust motor vehicle emission control rule augment meet aggressive tailpipe emission standard ramp zero emission vehicle note money state plan ban gas power vehicle generally require vote lawmaker advance support governor environmental regulator ev market struggle recent month highlight daily wire ford example cut employee rouge electric vehicle center roll plan production number electric f- lightning half slash billion ev investment president biden slow come target gas power vehicle industry early month biden environmental protection agency epa set new eye pop regulation effort increase number electric vehicle road new epa rule set emission standard vehicle eliminate billion ton greenhouse gas emission set concern nation example sen joe manchin wv rail epa call reckless ill inform federal government authority right mandate type car truck americans purchase everyday life senator say reckless ill inform rule impose effectively ev mandate ensure security supply chain nation like china realistic transition plan address domestic infrastructure need
EN_UA_000568.txt,Other,Other,"Russia Responds to UK’s ‘Very Dangerous’ Coup Allegations 

 Russia’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday dismissed claims from the United Kingdom that Moscow wanted to install a pro-Russia leader in Kyiv while it considers whether to invade the beleaguered Eastern European nation.

The UK further suggested that the Kremlin currently is “maintain[ing] links with” former officials including Serhiy Arbuzov, a former deputy prime minister of Ukraine between 2012 to 2014; Andriy Kluyev, first deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2012; former deputy chief of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Vladimir Sivkovich; and Mykola Azarov, the prime minister of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014.

What’s more, the UK statement alleges that former Ukrainian Parliament Member Yevhen Murayev “is being considered” by Russia’s leadership “as a potential candidate” to lead the Ukrainian government.

The UK did not provide evidence for its claim. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss asserted, however, that Moscow must deescalate tensions and “end its campaigns of aggression and disinformation, and pursue a path of diplomacy.”

But over the weekend, Russian officials said the UK’s Foreign Office should stop publishing “nonsense” and “disinformation.”

The embassy further alleged that the UK’s strategy is to accuse “Russia of plotting ‘inevitable’ invasion of Ukraine and try to play the role of an ideological leader, defending itself from ‘autocrats’ and aiming to ‘free the world.’”

Murayev, meanwhile, responded to the UK’s statement by dismissing the claim.

In a message to Reuters, Mykhailo Podolyak, a Ukrainian adviser to the presidential office, said the allegations should be taken seriously, acknowledged there was doubt among Ukrainians as to whether Murayev was “too ridiculous a figure” to be the Kremlin’s pick to lead Ukraine. But he added that Russia had propped up previously minor figures in leadership positions in annexed Crimea and separatist-held Donbass.

Therefore “one should take this information as seriously as possible,” he said.

On Saturday, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne appeared to endorse the UK assessment that the Kremlin is plotting to install a Moscow-friendly puppet administration.

“This kind of plotting is deeply concerning,” Horne said. “The Ukrainian people have the sovereign right to determine their own future, and we stand with our democratically-elected partners in Ukraine.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],russia respond uk dangerous coup allegation russia foreign ministry sunday dismiss claim united kingdom moscow want install pro russia leader kyiv consider invade beleaguered eastern european nation uk suggest kremlin currently maintain[e link official include serhiy arbuzov deputy prime minister ukraine andriy kluyev deputy prime minister deputy chief ukraine national security defense council vladimir sivkovich mykola azarov prime minister ukraine uk statement allege ukrainian parliament member yevhen murayev consider russia leadership potential candidate lead ukrainian government uk provide evidence claim foreign secretary liz truss assert moscow deescalate tension end campaign aggression disinformation pursue path diplomacy weekend russian official say uk foreign office stop publish nonsense disinformation embassy allege uk strategy accuse russia plot inevitable invasion ukraine try play role ideological leader defend autocrat aim free world murayev respond uk statement dismiss claim message reuter mykhailo podolyak ukrainian adviser presidential office say allegation take seriously acknowledge doubt ukrainian murayev ridiculous figure kremlin pick lead ukraine add russia prop previously minor figure leadership position annexed crimea separatist hold donbass information seriously possible say saturday u.s national security council spokeswoman emily horne appear endorse uk assessment kremlin plot install moscow friendly puppet administration kind plotting deeply concern horne say ukrainian people sovereign right determine future stand democratically elect partner ukraine

 ""Aren't They Fools?"": Putin Says Ukrainian Statehood Risks 'Irreparable Blow' If War Continues

Russian President Vladimir Putin gave statements on Tuesday which assessed the overall status of the nearly two-year conflict with Ukraine at a moment Western and world leaders meet in Davos for the World Economic Forum (WEF). Zelensky while there in Switzerland pressed Ukraine's case for the need to achieve air superiority.

But Putin in his fresh remarks stressed that not only do Russian forces have the clear upper hand, but he emphasized for the first time that Ukrainian statehood itself risks an ""irreparable"" blow if the war continues. He stressed that Ukraine's military has already ""failed"".

""Not only has their counteroffensive failed, but the initiative is entirely in the hands of the Russian Armed Forces,"" Putin said in the televised remarks. ""If this continues, Ukraine's statehood could be dealt an irreparable, very serious blow,"" he added, but he didn't clarify further precisely what he meant by this.

""They are trying to show that they can also do something. But instead of solving military tasks, they act in such a barbaric way. Attacks are being carried out on peaceful settlements with indiscriminate weapons,"" Putin said in reference to the past several weeks of cross-border attacks on Belgorod city, which have killed and maimed Russian civilians.

Putin further addressed Zelensky's efforts to gather world leaders for a peace summit hosted by Switzerland, to consider Kiev's 10-point peace plan, which it should be noted rejects the possibility of territorial concessions.

""The so-called 'peace formula' that's being talked about in the West and in Ukraine is a continuation of the decree of the Ukrainian president banning negotiations with Russia,"" Putin said, according to a translation in Sputnik.

""As for the negotiating process, it's an attempt to encourage us to abandon the territorial gains we've achieved over the past 1 1/2 years. But this is impossible. Everyone understands that this is impossible,"" the Russian leader continued.

He explained that earlier in the conflict, the two sides were close to serious negotiations that could have led to peace, but that ultimately Zelensky allowed himself to be the puppet of Western powers...

""A day later, they threw all the agreements into the trash, and now they are saying publicly—including the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group—that 'Yes, we were ready, but we missed the chance, because then-Prime Minister of Britain Mr. [Boris] Johnson came and persuaded us not to implement these agreements,'"" Putin said.

He stressed: ""Fools, are they not? They're admitting directly that if they had gone for it, everything could have been ended a long time ago, 1 1/2 years ago.""

Lately, Ukraine has been seeking to get China involved in getting on board with its peace formula. Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak on Sunday said, ""China needs to be involved in talks to end the war with Russia."" He issued the words just ahead of the WEF. China remains the most influential Global South country widely viewed as squarely in Russia's corner, having refused to rebuke Moscow or join Western-led sanctions after two years of the conflict.

 KHARKIV - Russia pounded over 30 villages and towns in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region after launching a ground offensive in the border region, forcing almost 6,000 to evacuate, the governor said on Monday. Ukraine’s General Staff acknowledged on Monday that Russia “currently is achieving tactical success” after driving a wedge into Kyiv’s defences. Russia’s defence ministry said on Monday that troops had “improved the tactical position and dealt a blow to (Ukrainian) manpower” around border villages including Lyptsi and the town of Vovchansk.

“They are shelling the villages, firing on everything they can,” Sergiy Kryvetchenko, deputy head of the military administration in the village of Lyptsi, told AFP. “The KABs (guided aerial bombs) are flying. The artillery is flying. Drones. Everything,” he said.On Friday, Russia began an offensive across its border into the Kharkiv region and later claimed to have taken several villages in the region near the border.

The situation in the Kharkiv region is “complex and dynamically changing”, with Russian troops mounting assaults in various areas, Ukraine’s General Staff said. Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Synegubov wrote on social media that over the last day, “more than 30” towns and villages “were struck by enemy artillery and mortar attacks”, wounding at least nine people.

Some areas were also bombed by Russian aircraft, Synegubov added. A total of 5,762 people have been evacuated from their homes since the start of the offensive, the governor said. Over the course of Sunday, Russia “carried out 22 assaults” in five border areas, 14 of which were still ongoing, the General Staff said. The General Staff said fighting was ongoing for the border town of Vovchansk, where Russia was deploying “significant forces”.

numbering up to five battalions.

Vovchansk, which previously had a population of 2,500 but now has only 200-300 residents, suffered “massive shelling” on Sunday that hit houses and wounded seven, said Synegubov.

A 69-year-old man was also wounded in the town of Izyum by detonating ammunition and a woman was injured in a village near the town of Kupiansk.

The city of Kharkiv itself had not been struck over the last 24 hours, however, he said.

Synegubov said on national television that “the grey zone and the front line are expanding” because Russia is “trying to deliberately stretch it, attacking in small groups in new directions”.

The DeepState Telegram channel, which is close to the Ukrainian army, wrote that Russia had taken pockets of territory measuring around 100 square kilometres (39 square miles).

Russia “continues to advance to Vovchansk”, the channel said.

“They are gaining foothold on the outskirts for further entry into the town.”

Russia was also advancing towards the border village of Lyptsi and attempting to enter the nearby village of Glyboke, it said.

Ukraine was mounting “constant fire”, including from drones, “but unfortunately it does not stop them”.

The Russian defence ministry said troops had repelled Ukrainian counterattacks near Glyboke.

Rybar, a Russian Telegram channel with military links, said Moscow’s offensive led to territorial gains because troops took some villages where Russian soldiers already had a presence and others that were “deserted wastelands”.

As of Monday morning, there were no “large-scale breakthroughs of the enemy’s defences”, Rybar said.

EN_CC_100069.txt,CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities,CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments,"U.K. Backs $1 Trillion Climate ‘Reparations’ I... 

 What fresh nonsense is this? Climate ‘reparations’ are coming, to compensate other countries for the ‘extreme weather’ they’ve been experiencing, which is allegedly our fault, because a model which has always been wrong said so. The U.K. has now backed the transparent scam. The Telegraph has more.

Britain has opened the door to paying climate change reparations to developing countries by supporting talks on the issue at the COP27 summit.

On Sunday, at the meeting in Egypt, U.K. negotiators backed a last-minute agreement to address “loss and damage” payments to countries badly affected by climate-related disasters.

Rishi Sunak will appear at the conference in Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday, where he will pledge £65.5 million for green technology in developing countries.

The Prime Minister will say: “By honouring the pledges we made in Glasgow, we can turn our struggle against climate change into a global mission for new jobs and clean growth. And we can bequeath our children a greener planet and a more prosperous future. That’s a legacy we could be proud of.”

Boris Johnson will also deliver a speech warning against the “naysayers” who threaten Net Zero targets.

Pakistan is leading a push by developing countries including Bangladesh and the Maldives for compensation from richer countries responsible for most of the world’s pollution.

The U.K. backed the issue being on the COP27 agenda during two days of negotiations ahead of the Egypt summit and is understood to accept that a deal must be done over the economic cost of climate change, which is forecast to reach $1 trillion by 2050.

On Sunday night, a Downing Street source said Mr Sunak planned to “scale up progress and support” for developing countries suffering the worst effects of global warming.

The Prime Minister will come under pressure in Egypt to agree to a costly deal on reparations at the same time as he draws up plans for sweeping domestic tax rises and spending cuts.

On Sunday night, Treasury sources said Jeremy Hunt had signed off up to £35 billion in spending cuts and up to £25 billion in tax hikes to fill an estimated financial black hole of £60 billion.

 The Biden administration continues to lead the world in contributions to Ukraine with nearly $200 billion in tax payers’ money promised or sent as aid, as American citizens suffering from disasters at home are told there is no money for them.

The Biden administration rejected a request for federal disaster assistance from Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine following the train derailment disaster in East Palestine that led to an unprecedented release of highly toxic chemicals, just days after the CDC edited the toxicology profile for vinyl chloride, massively increasing the lethal exposure level and removing information about how the chemical affects children

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) told Ohio’s state government that it was not eligible for disaster assistance to help the community recover from the toxic spill, Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for DeWine, told Fox News Digital on Thursday. Tierney explained that FEMA believed the incident didn’t qualify as a traditional disaster, such as a tornado or hurricane, for which it usually provides assistance.

According to Zelensky’s Ukrainian government, the US leads all countries with $196 billion in total military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine between January 24, 2022 through November 20, 2022. Germany has sent the second-most funds, with $172 billion sent in that span.

It is clear where Biden’s loyalties lie and the people of Ohio do not figure in that equation.

Fox reports: In that same span, the rest of the world has contributed less than $75 billion of total aid, with most of that sum coming from the United Kingdom ($28.2 billion), Poland ($24.3 billion), and Estonia ($5.48 billion).

Some members of Congress are looking to put a stop to the superabundant spending by the U.S. government, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who introduced a resolution to end military and financial aid to Ukraine.

“How much more for Ukraine? Is there any limit?” asked Gaetz, R-Fla., on the House floor. “Which billionth dollar really kicks in the door? Which red line we set will we not later cross?”

 DRAMATIC video shows a tank storming across the border from Ukraine into Russia today as anti-Putin soldiers claimed to have seized villages.

Drones were also reportedly used in the ""invasion"" as explosions rang out along the frontier in the Belgorod region - where the local governor issued a desperate ""don't panic"" message to residents.

The governor of the Belgorod region, Vyacheslav Gladkov, told residents that to ensure safety of citizens in the region, a ""counter-terrorist regime"" has been introduced.

Russian authorities said a ""Ukrainian Army sabotage group"" crossed the border and forces were ""taking measures to eliminate the enemy"".

Ukrainian intelligence said those involved in the incursion were ""solely Russian nationals"".

The provocative move was claimed by the Freedom of Russia Legion, a unit made up of ethnic Russian volunteers and defectors from the Russian army to fight alongside Ukraine.

In an unverified video today, members of the anti-Putin group posed in front of a road sign and an armoured car.

They claimed: ""We have again crossed the border of the Russian Federation. Russia will soon be free.

""The time to fight for the freedom of Russia has come.

""We want our children to grow up in peace and be free people... but that has no place in today's Putin's Russia.""

Armoured vehicles with Ukrainian markings were also spotted near the border, further fuelling rumours of an invasion by pro-Ukraine Russian saboteurs.

Smoke was spotted in multiple locations near border checkpoints in the region, along with videos online appearing to show a Russian soldier dead inside a checkpoint building.

And a helicopter was reportedly seen flying low over houses and deploying anti-missile flares in Rakitnoye, some 30 miles from the Grayvoron border crossing where the tank was spotted.

One post showed a radio message urgently telling Belgorod citizens to evacuate the area.

Governor Gladkov told residents earlier today: ""No one is hurt, the evacuation from Shebensky district is a lie.

""I urge you not to listen to enemies and not to panic.""

In a post on Telegram, the Freedom of Russia Legion shared a photo of a ""free Russia"" flag on a bridge.

They said: ""The first flags of free Russia met the dawn over the liberated cities. Raise the flags in your cities too. Freedom is near!""

The group claimed they had taken control of Kozinka and Gora-Podol villages.

Rumours spread that up to six other villages came under drone and mortar fire.

The flag raised in the photo is the flag used by Russian anti-war protesters - many of whom live in eastern Ukraine - and is also displayed on the Freedom of Russia Legion's Telegram channel.

It describes them as ""free citizens of Russia"" who are fighting against the ""dictatorial regime"" in Russia.

Another video widely shared online appeared to show the soldiers running into the streets of the southern Belgorod region.

This was followed by aerial shots of border towns showing smoke billowing from multiple buildings.

Russian authorities said administrative building in the town of Golovchino was allegedly struck by a drone, and part of a rocket fell into the garden of a home in the village of Antonovka.

Authorities claimed to have full control of the villages and said they were hunting the ""terrorists"" involved in the incursion.

 FACT CHECK: Is NASA Planning To Blast Ice Particles Into The Atmosphere To Fight Climate Change?

A video shared on Facebook claims the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change.

Verdict: False

The claim is false. The idea was proposed via a study conducted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and serves as a collaboration between NOAA and NASA, but has not been put into practice. A NASA spokesperson denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

Fact Check:

A “fresh group of NASA astronauts” who just completed basic training will participate in the first Boeing Starliner test launch in May, according to Space.com. The launch will be a week-long mission, the outlet reported.

In the Facebook video, an unnamed male claims NASA is purportedly planning to inject ice particles into the atmosphere to fight climate change based on an article from Unilad. The video, which originally stems from TikTok, has garnered over 1,000 views as of writing.

The claim is false, however. The Unilad article, published on Mar. 1, 2024, makes it clear that injecting ice particles into the atmosphere is only a “proposed solution” and has not been put into practice. The article also indicates the proposal is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA and references a recent piece from the Daily Mail that cites a study conducted by NOAA physicist Josh Schwarz.

According to the study, the concept is called intentional stratospheric dehydration and “would involve dispersing small particles (known as ice nuclei) into high altitude regions of the atmosphere that are both very cold and super-saturated in water vapor. These nuclei would increase the formation of ice crystals that otherwise would not have formed.”

“This ‘[ISD]’ strategy would not counteract a large fraction of the forcing from carbon dioxide but may contribute to a portfolio of climate interventions by acting with different time and length scales of impact and risk than other interventions that are already under consideration,” Schwarz and his co-authors wrote in the same study.

Likewise, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim. In fact, the opposite is true. Both Lead Stories and USA Today debunked the claim in Mar. 8 and Mar. 15 articles, respectively. (RELATED: No, 80 Percent Of Texas’ ‘Cattle Grazing Land’ Was Not Destroyed By Recent Fires)

Additionally, the claim is neither referenced on NASA’s website nor its verified social media accounts. NOAA also has not publicly commented on the claim.

NASA Spokesperson Allard Beutel denied the claim’s validity in an email to Check Your Fact.

“This is an unfortunate mischaracterization of a study done by another agency. As this was a study, NASA is not planning to inject ice into the stratosphere,” Beutel said.

 by Frank Bergman, Slay News:

A recent study has concluded that globalist claims of “manmade climate change” are completely fabricated and have no basis in reality.

The researchers found that there is no scientific evidence to support theories of anthropogenic “global warming.”

According to the study, led by leading scientists in Greece, claims that humans cause “climate change” are based on imagination and assumptions.

The study’s paper, authored by lead researcher Professor Demetris Koutsoyiannis of the National Technical University of Athens, was published in the scientific journal AIMS Press.

In the “Conclusions” section of the study’s paper, the researchers write:

“Rather, such claims are based on imagination and climatic models full of assumptions.

“However, as shown in the causality direction in time series produced by climatic models is opposite to that of the real-world data.”

The study found that the narrative of human-generated carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions affecting temperatures is based on fake science.

In the “Abstract” section of the paper, Koutsoyiannis notes:

“The premise of this study is that the climatic system is very complex and subject to perpetual change due to numerous processes, either internal or external to it.”

“The fact that one of them, namely the relationship of climate with atmospheric CO2, is highlighted in the last decades does not correspond to its actual importance as a climate driver.

“The promoted importance is a non-scientific issue, related to the narrative that humans, through their emissions by fossil fuel burning, are responsible for the changes we see in climate.”

The study stated that, under the guise of science, the propagation of the anti-CO2 narrative is being driven by political and economic forces.",EN,"['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Human activities do not impact climate change', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Data shows no temperature increase', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: CO2 concentrations are too small to have an impact', 'CC: Downplaying climate change: Climate cycles are natural', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives']",manmade climate change narrative completely fabricate study warn frank bergman slay news recent study conclude globalist claim manmade climate change completely fabricate basis reality researcher find scientific evidence support theory anthropogenic global warming accord study lead lead scientist greece claim human cause climate change base imagination assumption study paper author lead researcher professor demetris koutsoyiannis national technical university athens publish scientific journal aim press conclusion section study paper researcher write claim base imagination climatic model assumption show causality direction time series produce climatic model opposite real world datum study find narrative human generate carbon dioxide co)emission affect temperature base fake science abstract section paper koutsoyianni note premise study climatic system complex subject perpetual change numerous process internal external fact relationship climate atmospheric co highlight decade correspond actual importance climate driver promote importance non scientific issue relate narrative human emission fossil fuel burning responsible change climate study state guise science propagation anti co narrative drive political economic force
EN_UA_102655.txt,Other,Other,"BIOWARFARE ON AMERICANS: RFK Jr. says CIA was directly involved in funding COVID research for Wuhan lab 

 by Ethan Huff, Natural News:

The reason why the Biden regime could not care less about even attempting to punish communist China for covering up the “lab leak” that many believe occurred at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, allowing the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) to escape, is because doing so would expose the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and its bioweapons program.

These and other statements were made by 2024 presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in a recent interview with Fox News‘ Jesse Watters. Kennedy suggested that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is also involved in funding the bioweapons programs from which COVID appears to have originated.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“I think the CIA was involved certainly in this research,” Kennedy told Watters and viewers. “They were funding it through USAID. And NIH, I think, in the end gave about $26 million in funding to the Wuhan lab. But USAID, which was functioning as the CIA surrogate, gave over $64 million. The Pentagon also gave a lot of money.”

Kennedy would go on in the interview to blast Tony Fauci, the former head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), for his complicity in unleashing hell on the world that resulted in tens of millions of needless deaths.

“I think he caused a lot of injury,” Kennedy, who wrote an entire book about the subject, said of Fauci. “I think that he particularly, by withholding early treatment from Americans, we racked up the highest death count in the world. We only have 4.2 percent of the globe’s population but we had 16 percent of the COVID deaths in this country and that was from bad policy.”

RFK Jr. says vaccines do, in fact, cause autism

Unlike the United States, many other countries allowed their citizens to access tried-and-true remedies for coronaviruses such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), both of which were maligned or even banned in the U.S. as “fake news.”

“There were countries that did the opposite of what we did that provided ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, other early treatments to their population, and had 1/200th of our death rate,” Kennedy said.

Concerning the subject of vaccines, Kennedy clarified for Watters and viewers his longtime position that poison jabs do, in fact, cause autism – though that does not necessarily mean that he opposes vaccines being legal, just so long as sound science is able to back them.

“I do believe that autism comes from vaccines,” Kennedy revealed. “But I think most of the things people believe about my opinions about vaccines are wrong. I, you know, all I have said about vaccines is we should have good science.”

“We should have the same kind of testing, placebo-controlled trials that we have for every other medication. Vaccines are exempt from pre-licensing placebo-controlled trials. There’s no way that anybody can tell the risk profile of those products or even the relative benefits of those products before they’re mandated, and we should have that kind of testing.”

Be sure to watch the interview with Kennedy below:

One commenter noted that he agrees with Kennedy in that COVID was “cultivated” and “intentionally released at just the right time, one year before a U.S. presidential election.”

“It was perfect timing for Biden’s campaign to use it against Trump while they were working hard in the background to hide all of Biden’s corruption,” this person added. “I think they are also funding labs in Ukraine as well. That and NATO membership is one of the biggest reasons Russia invaded.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],biowarfare americans rfk jr say cia directly involve fund covid research wuhan lab ethan huff natural news reason biden regime care attempt punish communist china cover lab leak believe occur wuhan institute virology allow wuhan coronavirus covid- escape expose national institutes health nih bioweapon program statement presidential hopeful robert f. kennedy jr recent interview fox news jesse watter kennedy suggest central intelligence agency cia involve fund bioweapon program covid appear originate truth live https://sgtreport.tv/ think cia involve certainly research kennedy tell watter viewer fund usaid nih think end give million funding wuhan lab usaid function cia surrogate give million pentagon give lot money kennedy interview blast tony fauci head national institute allergy infectious disease niaid complicity unleash hell world result ten million needless death think cause lot injury kennedy write entire book subject say fauci think particularly withhold early treatment americans rack high death count world percent globe population percent covid death country bad policy rfk jr say vaccine fact cause autism unlike united states country allow citizen access try true remedy coronaviruse ivermectin hydroxychloroquine hcq malign ban u.s fake news country opposite provide ivermectin hydroxychloroquine early treatment population /th death rate kennedy say concern subject vaccine kennedy clarify watter viewer longtime position poison jabs fact cause autism necessarily mean oppose vaccine legal long sound science able believe autism come vaccine kennedy reveal think thing people believe opinion vaccine wrong know say vaccine good science kind testing placebo control trial medication vaccine exempt pre licensing placebo control trial way anybody tell risk profile product relative benefit product mandate kind testing sure watch interview kennedy commenter note agree kennedy covid cultivate intentionally release right time year u.s presidential election perfect timing biden campaign use trump work hard background hide biden corruption person add think fund lab ukraine nato membership big reason russia invade

 VLADIMIR Putin has honoured an army unit accused of war crimes and genocide in the Russian town of Bucha, reports suggest.

A decree signed by the Russian tyrant gave the 64th Motor Rifle Brigade the title of guards – scandalously praising them for ""mass heroism and valour, tenacity and courage.""

Earlier this month, the Ukrainian ministry identified the unit as those responsible for the alleged rape and murder of innocent Ukrainians.

The barbarous pack, headed by Lieutenant Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - dubbed the “Butcher of Bucha” - left a trail of death and destruction in their wake.

Harrowing pictures from the city, to the north-west of the capital Kyiv, showed the bodies of civilians scattered in the road and in shallow graves — many with bound hands and signs of torture.

Some of them, from the wounds they had suffered, had been shot from close range.

Heavily mutilated corpses of what appeared to be men scattered along the floor of a children's camp as rescue workers carried the innocent victims out in body bags.

A local priest said dogs were seen eating rotting corpses in apocalyptic scenes to grip the commuter town after the troops laid waste to warzones.

Men, women and children were found handcuffed with a bullet in the head and chest as evidence of alleged torture chambers emerged online.

Women and children were also found by Ukrainian soldiers, having been raped and then murdered.

The barbaric troops are believed to have conducted the Bucha slaughter as they scarpered from Kyiv after their botched attempt to take the Ukrainian capital.

Days later, Ukrainian intelligence suggested the troops were being redeployed in Belgorod in Western Russia amid claims that Russian commanders were refusing to rotate their brigades.

The country’s defence ministry claimed troops were being sent to the ""hottest spots"" in the hope they will be slaughtered by Ukrainian fighters before they can testify before a war crime tribunal.

The Kremlin has continued to deny accusations its troops committed war crimes in Ukraine after suggesting chilling pictures of dead bodies strewn across Kyiv streets were staged by Ukraine and the West.

Heroic President Volodymyr Zelensky was visibly emotional as he visited the site just days after the mass graves were discovered.

The Ukrainian leader was flanked by security as he vowed to ensure that the “war crimes” committed by Russian soldiers on his country’s soil were “the last such evil on Earth”.

Boris Johnson later described the events as not “far short of genocide” as the EU's Ursula von der Leyen was later seen visiting the scene of the massacre.

It comes as the number of heads of state and former prime ministers backing calls for an international tribunal over Ukraine continues to rise amid widespread international condemnation of the events unfolding in Eastern Europe.

 A FORMER spy alleges a body double stands in for Vladimir Putin at key events – and has revealed what he says are the tell-tale signs.

Sergei Zhirnov claims to have served alongside the Russian tyrant in the KGB intelligence service of the former Soviet Union, which is now known as the FSB.

Zhirnov said he had believed until now that claims of Putin using doppelgangers were “conspiracy theories”.

But he has now changed his mind, citing a speech made by a “skinny” and coughing Putin on February 21 and contrasting it with an appearance at a pro-war concert next day in Moscow as evidence.

Footage highlights him waving his hands around and repeatedly touching his nose, not traits especially common with Putin.

Zhirnov told Ukrainian TV that “a totally different Putin pops up” with “a wider face as if he bloated in 24 hours”.

READ MORE ON VLADIMIR PUTIN

""He has a totally different shape of eye orbits, a totally different head, absolutely different wrinkles - a different voice.”

Far from shunning people, perhaps to avoid Covid, he was “almost kissing and hugging everyone”.

His allegation comes as a video shows an unusually exuberant Russian president at a helicopter plant in Siberia.

Zhirnov is now exiled in France and was a former classmate of Putin at KGB Red Flag Institute, a spy training centre.

The claim Putin uses a body double has also been made by the head of Ukrainian military intelligence.

Major General Kyrylo Budanov claimed the body doubles are used to hide Putin’s loss of control in the Kremlin.

He claimed Ukrainian secret services detected Putin body doubles standing in for him on a number of ""special occasions"" in the past, but this had become ""usual practice"" now

""We know specifically about three people that keep appearing, but how many there are, we don't know,"" Budanov said.

""They all had plastic surgery to look alike.""

The spy chief alleged all the doubles had surgery but said the one thing that gives them away is their height.

“It's visible in videos and pictures. Also gesturing, body language and earlobes, since they are unique for every person.""

The claim that Putin uses body doubles is also regularly made by the General SVR Telegram and YouTube channel, which claims to be run by a Kremlin insider.

Most experts dismiss such claims as absurd and far-fetched, though several noticed Putin’s unusually buoyant mood in Siberia, compared to recent public appearances in Moscow.

One claim was that Putin had had an extra dose of medicine.

It has been alleged body doubles were used by former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev.

Putin three years ago admitted that officials had considered using doubles, but he claimed the idea was rejected.

""I discarded the idea of any doubles,” he said.

He admitted the idea came up in the early 2000s when Russia was hit by terrorist attacks.

It was suggested a lookalike should take his place at events where the head of state might be at risk, he said.

 It turns out that the green climate agenda is a ploy, or Trojan Horse, to let the enemy inside the gate to put all family farmers out of business; destroy the tradition of animal husbandry; and promote the worldwide consumption of insects rather than meat – for the non-elite, of course, since those at the top of the pyramid still plan to gorge on meat and the finest of the fine when it comes to all things fancy and gourmet.

It is you and I whom the globalists want to be stuck in chains eating cockroaches and crickets for dinner every night while we celebrate the ""happiness"" of owning absolutely nothing and somehow being happy about it – how is that supposed to work?

(Related: Did you catch the news that South Pole, the world's leading seller of so-called ""carbon credits,"" is no longer operational because it was all just a scam from the very beginning?)

In his documentary film ""No Farmers No Food,"" EpochTV host Roman Balmakov, the film's maker, discusses how an army of climate activists is being groomed by corrupt governments into shutting down all food-producing farms because said farms are ""destroying the planet,"" we are told.

Instead, the powers that be want these farms to be replaced by bug factories like the kinds billionaire eugenicist Bill Gates is starting to build across the tens of millions of United States farm acreage he has been gobbling up in recent years.

""People in charge of some of the most powerful organizations on the planet have determined that agriculture, specifically animal agriculture, is to blame for global warming, and global warming is to blame for the high prices of food and food shortages,"" Balmakov says about who he believes is behind the green agenda.

By now, you have probably heard about the farmer protests in The Netherlands, which have spread to the United Kingdom, Bulgaria, and elsewhere as green politicians in these areas push to outlaw traditional farming due to the ""carbon"" it produces.

In other areas such as California, green bureaucrats are taking a slightly different approach by simply depriving farmers of the water they need to grow food for the nation and world. By creating constant artificial scarcity of water through ""droughts"" (i.e., flagrant water mismanagement), the narrative can be spun that we are running out of water and thus must stop eating meat.

We are already seeing the consequences of all this green meddling in the form of sky-high food prices and food shortages, and what will soon become widespread famine and mass starvation.

Truth be told, the ever-so-slight ""warming"" that one can, in a way, argue has been occurring – the earth goes through warming and cooling phases all the time, a simple fact check shows – has actually helped the planet by making it more green in a literal sense with more plants and improved crop yields.

The greenies are always lying about this, though. They want us to believe that unless we get rid of all meat, gas-powered cars, and industry, the ecosystems of the planet are going to collapse. This is a lie that must constantly be refuted, or else you had better start getting used to cockroach curry, mosquito marinades, and fly flakes in your pantry.

EN_CC_200024.txt,Other,Other,"African lawmakers agree to back climate action to avert food crises 

 Eastern African parliamentarians on Thursday agreed to champion the cause for swift and determined climate action from governments and relevant organizations to avert food crises and malnutrition in the sub-region.

""The Eastern Africa sub-region is particularly vulnerable, experiencing cascading effects on food security, nutrition, poverty, and livelihoods. Climate change leads to a breakdown of food systems, resulting in loss of rural livelihoods, income, and ecosystems,"" said the Eastern Africa Parliamentary Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in a joint statement issued in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, after attending the fifth general assembly meeting organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

The meeting discussed current legal and policy issues and gaps related to climate action and food systems transformation in the sub-region, as well as opportunities and priority actions, including policy options and financing mechanisms, to advance this crucial agenda in Eastern Africa.

Some 22 million children under the age of 5 years are stunted in eastern Africa, according to FAO. /CFP

Some 22 million children under the age of 5 years are stunted in eastern Africa, according to FAO. /CFP

Adan Haji Yusuf, the chairperson of the alliance, stressed the essential role of parliamentarians in combating hunger and malnutrition. He highlighted that their legislative, budgetary, and oversight responsibilities uniquely position them to elevate the importance of food and nutrition security to the highest levels of the political and legislative agenda.

Moses Wetangula, speaker of the National Assembly of Kenya, said Africa has struggled with poverty and hunger despite having all the necessary agricultural resources and policy instruments. Wetangula questioned why Africa, with its vast arable land, dynamic youth, favorable weather, and abundant water, has not been able to achieve food self-sufficiency and social transformation over an extended period.

""I urge fellow parliamentarians to shift their attention towards fulfilling the crucial investment requirements for agriculture, as outlined in the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program, which stipulates that countries allocate ten percent of their national budget to agriculture,"" he said.

According to recent FAO data for 2023, 135 million people in eastern Africa are undernourished, almost half of the 282 million undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa. Some 22 million children under 5 years old are stunted, and 362 million people, representing 85 percent of the region's population, cannot afford a healthy diet, FAO said.

David Phiri, special adviser to FAO assistant director-general and outgoing sub-regional coordinator for Eastern Africa, underlined the pressing concerns of both climate change and food insecurity and malnutrition in the Eastern African region. Phiri said that even though the sub-region hosts less than 25 percent of the African population, it accounts for almost 50 percent of the undernourished people in sub-Saharan Africa.

He emphasized that the bidirectional relationship between climate change and agriculture creates an unprecedented challenge for the farming population, noting that extreme weather events, which mainly occur due to climate change, are becoming among the major triggers of such a predicament.

The Eastern Africa Parliamentary Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition, established in April 2019 in Arusha, Tanzania, comprises members of Parliament from Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda.

 A Former Ukrainian MP Blew The Whistle On Burisma's Connections To Terrorism

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

Former Ukrainian MP Andrey Derkach, who’s reviled by the Biden Administration for sharing dirt about Hunter Biden’s Burisma corruption scandal with Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani ahead of the 2020 elections, just gave a very important interview to Belarus’ BelTA where be blew the whistle even louder. According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.

Derkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.

On the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.

About that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.

That’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.

In his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”

Looking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.

Altogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.

The dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other']",ukrainian mp blow whistle burisma connection terrorism ukrainian mp blow whistle burisma connection terrorism author andrew korybko substack ukrainian mp andrey derkach revile biden administration share dirt hunter biden burisma corruption scandal trump lawyer rudy giuliani ahead election give important interview belarus belta blow whistle louder accord million bribe pay cash shut investigation son scandal eventually find way ukrainian armed force military intelligence agency derkach claim proof secret court order divide fund invest portion build country drone army second finance terrorist attack like assassination darya dugina specifically mention interview allegation expand one share early year real world impact hunter corruption scandal analyze time subject ukrainian assassination terrorism derkach say cia fbi actually condone action despite public claim contrary warn immoral policy inevitably ricochet particular cite fbi chief christopher wray testimony congress april say law enforcement official fear crocus like attack presently plot country shouldn forget ukraine military intelligence service gur chief suspect russia investigation bad terrorist attack history mean portion burisma million bribe way hand likely finance word order effect hunter corruption scandal partially responsible brutal murder innocent civilian halfway world year later scandalous derkach share detail indirect consequence cover son illicit activity add gur link figure connect western narrative september nord stream terrorist attack regard story distraction complicity view elaborate time enter discourse laud cia length go cover role view cia send highly train ukrainian diving team baltic sea exactly western medium report plant fake bomb word cover story shouldn belittle experience cia experience mi prepare cover operation lot experience proxy cover story form certain position order dodge responsibility actually happen look forward derkach expect ukraine attempt terrorist attack russia public precondition accept cia leak medium lay blame zelensky lap derkach believe actually chief staff andrey yermak run albeit western puppet convince west prepare formally replace zelensky doesn know altogether importance derkach interview veteran ukrainian politician retain lot source inside regime having serve rada whopping year homeland charge treason flee russia early follow charge election meddling behalf country september argument politically drive attempt intimidate whistleblower dirt derkach share hunter burisma corruption scandal mention newly reveal order effect lead brutal killing civilian halfway world company bribe way gur hand enemy government ukrainian proxy try discredit sensational allegation listen say mind

 China France File photo: cnsphoto

As French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs Stéphane Séjourné will kick off a visit to China on Monday, Chinese experts said on Sunday that economic and trade relations are the cornerstone of China-France bilateral ties, and the two countries have broad cooperation prospects in green development and technology innovation.

This type of bilateral cooperation has set a good example for the EU by adhering to the principle of mutual benefit and addressing differences through dialogue and consultation, experts said.

On Friday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian announced that Séjourné will pay a visit to China on Monday at the invitation of Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi.

During Séjourné's visit, the two countries are expected to focus on bilateral economic and trade relations, solving problems encountered in cooperation, and creating a better business environment for enterprises of both sides, Cong Yi, a professor at the Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Sunday.

In addition, they may strengthen communication and cooperation in international affairs and jointly address global challenges such as climate change and public health, Cong noted.

This year marks the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. France will be the guest country of honor at the China International Fair for Trade in Services 2024 and the seventh China International Import Expo.

Over the past six decades, the two countries have adhered to mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, with economic and trade cooperation becoming increasingly closer, experts noted.

""China and France eye faster growth in traditional areas including agricultural products, aviation and civilian nuclear power,"" Cong said.

Under the mechanism ""from French farms to Chinese tables,"" the two countries have reaped fruitful achievements in agricultural products.

As an important source of China's agricultural and food imports, France is China's top agricultural import market and second-largest agricultural trading partner in the EU.

For many years, France has been the largest supplier of bottled still and sparkling wines to China. According to the China Association for Imports and Export of Wines and Spirits, China's wine imports in 2022 amounted to about $1.43 billion, with an import volume of 335,300 kiloliters, of which three countries - France, Chile and Italy - accounted for nearly 80 percent.

In 2022, France's wine exports to China totaled $661.9 million.

In addition, France was the first Western country to sign an air transportation agreement with China and the first Western country to cooperate with China in civilian nuclear energy, according to new.china.com.

""The digital economy will become an important area of economic and trade cooperation between China and France. The two sides can launch in-depth collaboration in artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and other fields,"" Cong said.

The two countries also have extensive room for cooperation in the field of clean energy, and they can jointly develop and promote new-energy technologies to help transform the global energy structure, he noted.

Moreover, cooperation between China and France in the fields of the economy, trade, science and technology has demonstrated the broad prospects and great potential of China-EU cooperation, which has helped to enhance the confidence of both sides in cooperation between China and Europe, Cong said.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],china france cooperation set example eu china france file photo cnsphoto french minister europe foreign affair stéphane séjourné kick visit china monday chinese expert say sunday economic trade relation cornerstone china france bilateral tie country broad cooperation prospect green development technology innovation type bilateral cooperation set good example eu adhere principle mutual benefit address difference dialogue consultation expert say friday chinese foreign ministry spokesperson lin jian announce séjourné pay visit china monday invitation member political bureau cpc central committee minister foreign affairs wang yi séjourné visit country expect focus bilateral economic trade relation solve problem encounter cooperation create well business environment enterprise side cong yi professor tianjin university finance economic tell global time sunday addition strengthen communication cooperation international affair jointly address global challenge climate change public health cong note year mark th anniversary establishment diplomatic relation china france france guest country honor china international fair trade service seventh china international import expo past decade country adhere mutual benefit win win outcome economic trade cooperation increasingly close expert note china france eye fast growth traditional area include agricultural product aviation civilian nuclear power cong say mechanism french farm chinese table country reap fruitful achievement agricultural product important source china agricultural food import france china agricultural import market second large agricultural trading partner eu year france large supplier bottled sparkle wine china accord china association import export wine spirit china wine import amount billion import volume kiloliter country france chile italy account nearly percent france wine export china total million addition france western country sign air transportation agreement china western country cooperate china civilian nuclear energy accord new.china.com digital economy important area economic trade cooperation china france side launch depth collaboration artificial intelligence big datum cloud computing field cong say country extensive room cooperation field clean energy jointly develop promote new energy technology help transform global energy structure note cooperation china france field economy trade science technology demonstrate broad prospect great potential china eu cooperation help enhance confidence side cooperation china europe cong say

 After Russia announced Tuesday that it will pull out some troops from near the Ukrainian border, top NATO officials expressed that they are “cautiously optimistic” for a de-escalation of tensions.

“There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue. This gives grounds for cautious optimism. But so far we have not seen any sign of de-escalation on the ground from the Russian side,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters Tuesday morning following Russia’s announcement.

Russia did not say how many units were being withdrawn, and how far, after a build-up of some 130,000 Russian troops to the north, east, and south of Ukraine. Video footage posted online by the Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on Tuesday allegedly showed Russian tanks moving back to their permanent bases and away from the border.

NATO said that it has yet to see evidence of a de-escalation in the crisis.

“Russia has amassed a fighting force in and around Ukraine unprecedented since the cold war. Everything is now in place for a new attack,” Stoltenberg said. “But Russia still has time to step back from the brink, stop preparing for war and start working for a peaceful solution.”

The Kremlin said Tuesday’s developments were proof that Western talk of war had been both false and hysterical.

“February 15, 2022 will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement, according to Reuters.

On Monday, Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko told Russian media the United States and the West are trying to “spark a conflict” with recent statements about a possible invasion.

“Look, if we planned any war against Ukraine, the media would have behaved completely differently. Because the media is the modern war’s bombardments,” he said.

France said it had yet to confirm the return of some Russian troops to bases, though this would be a positive sign. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, on the latest Western diplomatic mission to defuse the crisis, met Putin in the Kremlin.

Over the past weekend and on Monday, White House officials called on Americans to leave Ukraine and asserted that an invasion could occur in the near future. No evidence was provided for the second claim.

The U.S. Department of State also shut down its embassy in Kyiv and moved it to Lviv, located in the western part of Ukraine.

“We are in the process of temporarily relocating our Embassy operations in Ukraine from our Embassy in Kyiv to Lviv due to the dramatic acceleration in the buildup of Russian forces,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement.

“These prudent precautions in no way undermine our support for or our commitment to Ukraine. Our commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering,” Blinken added, noting that “the path for diplomacy” is available.

Around the same time, confusion was sparked when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a statement on Facebook that said Russia would invade on Feb. 16. However, his office later said that he made the remarks sarcastically in an apparent attempt to make light of various Western intelligence reports suggesting an imminent invasion.",EN,['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader'],['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors'],nato cautiously optimistic amid report russian troop withdrawal russia announce tuesday pull troop near ukrainian border nato official express cautiously optimistic de escalation tension sign moscow diplomacy continue give ground cautious optimism far see sign de escalation ground russian nato secretary general jens stoltenberg tell reporter tuesday morning follow russia announcement russia unit withdraw far build russian troop north east south ukraine video footage post online russian defense ministry press service tuesday allegedly show russian tank move permanent basis away border nato say evidence de escalation crisis russia amass fighting force ukraine unprecedented cold war place new attack stoltenberg say russia time step brink stop prepare war start work peaceful solution kremlin say tuesday development proof western talk war false hysterical february history day western war propaganda fail humiliate destroy single shot fire foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova say statement accord reuter monday belarussian president alexander lukashenko tell russian medium united states west try spark conflict recent statement possible invasion look plan war ukraine medium behave completely differently medium modern war bombardment say france say confirm return russian troop basis positive sign german chancellor olaf scholz late western diplomatic mission defuse crisis meet putin kremlin past weekend monday white house official call americans leave ukraine assert invasion occur near future evidence provide second claim u.s department state shut embassy kyiv move lviv locate western ukraine process temporarily relocate embassy operation ukraine embassy kyiv lviv dramatic acceleration buildup russian force secretary state antony blinken say statement prudent precaution way undermine support commitment ukraine commitment ukraine sovereignty territorial integrity unwavering blinken add note path diplomacy available time confusion spark ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky post statement facebook say russia invade feb office later say remark sarcastically apparent attempt light western intelligence report suggest imminent invasion

Are you ready for your government to tell you that you can only travel a 20-minute radius from home because it’s part of saving the planet from global warming? Scotland’s plan to implement “20-minute neighborhoods” nationwide is almost ready to launch, and have no doubts, it’s just another fancy name for climate lockdowns. No, this is not about the pandemic. This is about the governments of the world attempting to steal more freedoms and rights from their citizens, and if you believe you can save the world by staying near your home and neighborhood, then you most definitely are completely brainwashed by the crooked “system.”


The fake “war on carbon” includes restrictive 20-minute “neighborhoods” monitored by the tyrannical Scottish government and the United Nations

It’s documented already. The Scottish government is prepared for climate lockdowns, where their citizens may never leave their homes again, except to visit the city park (think prison ‘yard’) or the nearby convenient store, then return immediately to house arrest. Every citizen will be treated like a hard criminal, and actually really become one, if the new mandates are broken.

This is all documented under the United Nations’ “Sustainable Development Goals” umbrella policy. That’s because the “Climate Emergency Response Group” is on the scene, ready to save planet earth from the evil car users and restore the temperature back to whatever it was at before cars were invented (the same).

Get ready to “decarbonize” your energy and land use, while surrendering all of your “natural assets” in ways that benefit the “communities” (big government). That’s right, the Scottish government is planning “future places” where people can walk around or drive a few miles to escape their home prisons. This is also called “local living” and “green space” under the UN goal’s documented “National Planning Framework.”

“National Spatial Strategy” spells out “liveable places” and “productive places” meaning work from home and never leave, except for government-supervised local movements

Scotland is just a litmus test for the rest of the world. Have no doubts that once this is implemented and the populace succumbs, it will become a law of the New World Order, run by NATO police and the globalists, to keep the whole world on climate lockdown. This is not a Marvel movie where a few superheroes must save the planet from the sun’s heat bursting all of the humans into flames next month. This is reality, even though the earth is in a slow cooling phase that won’t affect humans for about a million more years. That’s why you should follow the science, not the rogue governments and their insane mandates, if you want to survive this.

Scotland’s Climate Change Plan is focused on achieving “net zero emissions by 2045,” meaning their economy will be completely wrecked, the citizens all starving to death, zero employment outside of working from home off a phone or computer, and total government tyranny. The “need to travel” will be reduced by 20%, periodically, until no person shall leave their home ever again, for anything, in order to save earth from global burning.

No person in Scotland will be allowed to travel more than 20 minutes from their home, and just how soon until even that is reduced to 10, 5, 1, then zero? It’s like when the governments said everyone would have to wear Covid masks for just a couple weeks, to flatten out the curve, then we would all go back to normal. Remember that?

 George W. Bush and Barack Obama will hold back-to-back conferences this week focusing on “democracy” and “disinformation.”

George W. Bush’s executive director who is working with the former president on the democracy and disinformation conference is David J.

 The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

ajor international organizations issued an appeal Wednesday for urgent measures to deal with rising food insecurity in poor countries, including financing to support farmers and increase food supplies.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Western sanctions on Moscow, have sent energy and food prices soaring in recent weeks, while rising natural gas prices also have impacted fertilizer production, which in turn hurts farmers.

""It is critical to quickly provide support for food insecure countries in a coordinated manner,"" the heads of the IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization and UN World Food Program said in a joint statement.

Protests have erupted in some countries over high prices, and the statement said, ""The increase in food prices and supply shocks can fuel social tensions in many of the affected countries, especially those that are already fragile or affected by conflict.""

The organizations called on the international community to provide financing for emergency food supplies, a safety net for poor families and farmers, and to increase agricultural production.

They also called for ""open trade"" that avoids export restrictions or ""humanitarian food purchases.""

While the poor nations are most vulnerable to the crisis, middle income countries increasingly are at risk, the statement said.

""Surging fertilizer prices along with significant cuts in global supplies have important implications for food production in most countries, including major producers and exporters, who rely heavily on fertilizer imports,"" they said.

IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, World Bank President David Malpass, WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and WFP director David Beasley issued the statement before next week's meeting of the IMF and World Bank.

Increased fragility

The war in Ukraine came as the global economy was trying to right itself following the COVID-19 pandemic, while navigating supply chain snarls that created shortages and a surge in inflation.

New lockdowns in China have added further uncertainty to the recovery.

Ukraine is a key source of grain while Russia is a major producer of energy and fertilizer needed for agriculture.

Protestors in Peru have taken to the streets to demand government action, as did people in Sri Lanka, where the government on Tuesday announced it was defaulting on its US$51 billion in foreign debt.

Poverty rose sharply during the pandemic, and the World Bank warns that for each one percentage point increase in food prices, 10 million people are thrown into extreme poverty worldwide.

""Sharply higher prices for staples and supply shortages are increasing pressure on households worldwide and pushing millions more into poverty,"" the officials said.

""Increased fragility and conflict pose persistent harm to people around the globe.""

EN_UA_021918.txt,Other,Other,"US, China, Israel and others are developing AI killer drones; this poses significant risks 

 by Rhoda Wilson, Expose News:

The Pentagon’s recent developments in AI technology have drawn concern and criticism as they approach the deployment of autonomous AI weapons systems capable of making lethal decisions independently.

The New York Times reports that countries such as the United States, China and Israel are actively working on lethal autonomous weapons empowered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), which can autonomously identify and engage targets.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Critics argue that the use of AI-controlled drones with the ability to autonomously kill humans is a highly alarming development, as it places life-or-death choices on machines with minimal human oversight. Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.

The issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.

Meanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.

US Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.

Critics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.

Advocacy groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots warn that AI technology’s dehumanisation poses significant risks. This dehumanisation could not only impact the use of force but also permeate other aspects of our lives, extending to automation in law enforcement, smart homes, and beyond. The campaign notes the urgent need for a global treaty banning autonomous weapons to prevent the wide-scale production and proliferation of these technologies from potentially falling into the wrong hands.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],china israel develop ai killer drone pose significant risk rhoda wilson expose news pentagon recent development ai technology draw concern criticism approach deployment autonomous ai weapon system capable make lethal decision independently new york times report country united states china israel actively work lethal autonomous weapon empower artificial intelligence ai autonomously identify engage target truth live https://sgtreport.tv/ critic argue use ai control drone ability autonomously kill human highly alarming development place life death choice machine minimal human oversight country include russia australia israel oppose effort nation pass bind resolution united nations call ban ai killer drone issue surround deployment ai weapon spark intense debate key question revolve role human agency use force austria chief negotiator matter alexander kmentt emphasise issue security legal concern ethical pentagon reveal plan deploy swarm ai enable drone ai weapon programme drone equip advanced ai capability intend provide united states tactical advantage counter numerical superiority china liberation army deputy secretary defence kathleen hick highlight role ai control drone swarm reshape battlefield dynamic make hard plan hit defeat concern arise human supervision decision make capability argue limitation ai autonomy hinder strategic advantage critic point recent incident ai drone utilise conflict zone ukraine use ai control drone conflict russia extent human casualty cause ai drone remain uncertain raise additional concern advocacy group like campaign stop killer robot warn ai technology dehumanisation pose significant risk dehumanisation impact use force permeate aspect life extend automation law enforcement smart home campaign note urgent need global treaty ban autonomous weapon prevent wide scale production proliferation technology potentially fall wrong hand
EN_UA_300145.txt,Other,Other,"Over 1000 Indian MBBS students evacuated from war-torn Ukraine resume studies at Uzbekistan medical varsity 

 Hundreds of Indian MBBS students, who had to leave war-hit Ukraine in 2021, have resumed their studies in a leading medical university in Uzbekistan. The Samarkand State Medical University in Uzbekistan welcomed over 1,000 Indian medical students who were evacuated from Ukraine after the Indian Embassy there inquired about the possibility of a transfer for the affected students.

Amit, originally from Bihar’s Begusarai, experienced the Russian attack in Ukraine and spent one night in a basement. He was among the students evacuated by the Indian government through the ‘Operation Ganga’ initiative.

‘Operation Ganga’ was launched by the Indian government to bring back Indians stranded in Ukraine, resulting in the successful evacuation of a total of 18,282 Indian nationals under the initiative.

“I thought I wouldn’t make it and would either die or will be stranded in Ukraine. Once I was back home in India, me and my family were relieved but then began the never-ending cycle of uncertainty about what was next. I had finished three years of my MBBS in Ukraine and to start all over again or pursue something else was not an option I wanted to consider. I later decided to move to Uzbekistan,” Amit told PTI.

He says living expenses in Samarkand are higher than that of Ukraine but he is happy to be able to continue his education.

Tanwi Wadhva from Punjab’s Ferozepur, who was studying at Bukovinian State Medical University in Ukraine, was apprehensive about joining the university due to the loss of a semester.

“I attended online classes for eight months. We were hopeful that the war would end and we would go back. Some students even went back from different routes but I didn’t want to take that risk. I evaluated all options from Georgia to Poland and decided to come to Uzbekistan. The university admitted us a semester back, I was initially apprehensive about the loss of one semester but later I changed my mind and it was worth the decision,” she said.

Divyansh from Meerut who used to study at the same university as Wadhwa said Uzbekistan’s universities offered teaching and learning in English and the curriculum was on the same lines.

“Not all countries have universities which offer English as a medium of instruction. So that was a very important factor. Quality of life is similar in Ukraine and Samarkand but this place feels safer now,” he said.

Around 19,000 Indian students were studying in Ukraine when the Russian invasion began in February 2021.

According to estimates, approximately 2,000 Indian students have gone back to Ukraine and they are residing mostly in the western part of the East European country.

Several Indian medical students were left with no choice after their evacuation from Ukraine and transferred to universities in other countries to continue their studies. Many have gone to Russia, Serbia and other European countries.

Dr Zafar Aminov, Vice Chancellor, of Samarkand State Medical University, said when the war broke out, the Indian Embassy reached out to them enquiring if the affected students could seek a transfer.

“We evaluated the requirements of such students and then ultimately decided that enrolling them with a semester back would be a viable option to provide equivalence. We then set up a team to facilitate transfers and also made special arrangements for these students. We hired 30 more Indian teachers to ensure there are no accent issues,” he told PTI.

Aminov said the university has accommodated over 1,000 Indian transfer students from Ukraine.

Deepika Kaidala Jayaramaiah, a student from Karnataka, said after seeing the war situation right in front of her, moving to a peaceful country was the priority.

“I have only read about war in history books. Never imagined that I would witness the situation in person. After it was evident that going to Ukraine was not an option now, I decided to resume my medical journey in Uzbekistan,” she said.

 Ukrainians show strength at Deaflympics in Brazil

Caxias do Sul (Brazil) (AFP) – When Rymma Filimoshkina practiced the hammer throw in the yard near her house in Mariupol at the start of the Ukraine war, her neighbors thought she was throwing a bomb.

Issued on:

But her ""weapon"" isn't one of destruction: it just won the 33-year-old deaf athlete a gold medal at the Deaflympics in Brazil.

Thousands of kilometers (miles) from the conflict at home, the Ukrainian team is raking in the medals at the Olympics for the deaf, which opened on May 1 and wrap up Sunday in the southern city of Caxias do Sul.

With two days left to go in the Games, Ukraine had a commanding lead in the medal table, with a total of 116 -- more than double the second-place United States.

""In this event, we show the world we exist: we are Ukraine, a real powerful, independent and democratic country,"" said Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the Ukraine Paralympic committee.

""One soldier called us and said: in between battles, we support you on TV. Your fighting spirit in sports is very important for us,"" he told AFP.

'Really want' peace

Ukraine has a history of punching above its weight in disabled sport.

Its Paralympic program owes its success to two and a half decades of specialized schools in every region of the country for children with disabilities, who start participating in sporting programs at an early age, Sushkevych says.

Ukraine finished sixth in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo last year, and second at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in March, just after Russia launched its invasion.

The team's success at the Deaflympics is symbolically charged: Ukraine had finished second in the medal table at the last three editions of the event -- behind Russia, which was banned from all international competitions over the invasion.

""I dedicate these medals to Ukraine. I'm very proud to represent my country,"" said a smiling Dmytro Levin, a 24-year-old native of Kharkiv, speaking in sign language after winning two golds and a bronze in orienteering.

""I'm happy to have won this medal for Ukraine. But all I really want is peace,"" said 15-year-old Sofia Chernomorova, who won bronze in badminton.

'Didn't hear the sirens'

Filimoshkina said she still remembers the vibrations she felt with every bomb that exploded in Mariupol, the port city devastated by relentless Russian strikes.

""A lot of deaf people died because they didn't hear the air raid sirens and went outside at the wrong time,"" she said.

Her teammate Julia Kysylova, who won silver in the hammer throw, said that for a long time, she was sure they would have to cancel their trip for the Games.

""When the war erupted, it was impossible to train. I spent a month sheltering at home,"" said the 25-year-old athlete from Nova Kakhovka, in the hard-hit southern region of Kherson.

She finally managed to flee to Spain, leaving her husband behind.

""It was a miracle we managed to cross the border. The trip took more than two days,"" she said.

""After the Games, I hope to go back home and be with my husband,"" she added.

""But I don't know if that will be possible.""

EN_UA_103445.txt,Other,Other,"Vladimir Putin spotted with mystery ‘prominent scar’ on his neck as rumours about ‘thyroid cancer battle’ swirl 

 VLADIMIR Putin was spotted with a mystery ""prominent scar"" on his neck that has led to swirling rumours the despot is amid a ""thyroid cancer battle"".

Intrigue over the Russian leader's health resurfaced following photos that were snapped at an Orthodox Easter cathedral service in Moscow at the weekend.

Images showed stone-faced Putin clasping a candle as the church proceedings went on.

However, most strikingly was an evident ""scar"" on his neck.

It prompted a debate online about whether the new snaps stack up the claims made by Proekt media, who have said Putin is suffering from thyroid cancer.

The independent outlet spearheaded an investigation that revealed the dictator was constantly accompanied by a team of surgeons.

One in particular, Yevgeny Selivanov, who specialises in thyroid cancer.

The scar appears as a prominent diagonal line upwards from left to right on his neck.

It was clearly seen in the pictures posted by the Kremlin from the Easter service.

Telegram channel, Unian, claimed the scar was the shape of a letter 'Z', a pro-war symbol used by Putin’s invading forces.

Most read in The Sun

An Unian spokesman said: ""A strange scar in the shape of the letter 'Z' has been noticed on Putin's neck.

""The unusual shots were taken on Easter when the dictator visited a cathedral.""

Denis Kazaksky, a Ukrainian blogger, also pointed to the ""prominent scar"" in one of his social media videos.

He said: ""What is it with Volodya [Putin]?

""I think I have figured out where the 'Z' came from.""

It is not the first time Putin's apparent scar has come to light.

In December 2020, Russian media outlet Sobesednik identified a distinct marking on his neck.

At the time, plastic surgeon Amjad Al-Yousef said: ""In theory, after intubation such a scar can remain, but this is only in theory.

""It often happens that not even a scar remains as the skin heals.""

He was speaking before suspicious claims emerged that Putin suffered from thyroid cancer.

However, there is no evidence the despot leader has ever undergone surgery for removal of the thyroid gland.

Al-Yousef claimed it could possibly not be a scar but a mark in his loose skin - common in an ""elderly person"".

Conversely in 2020, the marking did not appear as prominent as seen in recent days at the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow.

Al-Yousef suggested Putin, 70, had undergone regular plastic surgery on his face - but this was not done on his neck.

He said: ""No plastic surgery is performed on this part of the body.

""Even if we assume that this is some kind of innovation in plastic surgery, then in this case it would have been performed more professionally without such a serious mistake.""

Pointing to a photo of Putin from 2020, Al-Yousef clarified the differences in appearance.

He said: ""Here is the classic neck of a 68 year old man with low skin strength.

“With age, skin turgor changes and becomes weaker.

""Vladimir Putin’s face is very well-groomed, professional cosmetic care is noticeable.

""And when we see the perfect face, we naturally begin to pay attention to the skin of the neck.

""Unfortunately, there are no such effective professional treatments for the neck.

""While putting a shirt and a tie on, the throat is squeezed, the skin gathers and turns into such a fold.""

The Proekt investigative report claimed one medic Alexey Shcheglov ""relentlessly"" followed the Russian leader and had made 59 trips encompassing 282 days by his side.

According to the report, Shcheglov was seen as a medic ""who, among other things, can be the first to detect problems with the thyroid gland, including oncological ones.""

Putin was also under the attention of Igor Esakov, an ENT specialist, who made 38 trips to Putin, covering 152 days.

He was also accompanied by Yevgeny Selivanov, a cancer surgeon - during 35 trips, it was reported.

His expertise covers ""peculiarities of diagnostics and surgical treatment of elderly and senile patients with thyroid cancer.""

Multiple other medics were revealed as caring for the Russian president.

Separate claims have suggested Putin was undergoing chemotherapy.

One political analyst claimed the warmonger was ""high on speed"" to get through key meetings as he struggles with health issues.

EN_CC_300040.txt,CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities,CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities,"California Governor Slams Big Oil For Lying About Climate Change 

 US News & World Report's…

While predictions of a fully-fledged…

California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, accused the oil industry of lying days after the state’s Attorney General filed a lawsuit against five Big Oil majors for downplaying climate change risks.

“The climate crisis is, after all, a fossil fuel crisis,” Newsom said, as quoted by Bloomberg, at the opening of Climate Week in New York City. “They continue to play us for fools. I’ve had enough and I’m sick and tired of this.”

On Friday, Newsom’s office posted on X “Big Oil has been lying to us – covering up the fact that they’ve long known how dangerous the fossil fuels they produce are for our planet. It has been decades of damage & deception. With @AGRobBonta , California is taking action to hold big polluters accountable.”

The “big polluters” referred to in the post include Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell, and ConocoPhillips, Reuters reported. The American Petroleum Institute is also among the defendants.

The lawsuit alleges these companies had caused Californians billions of dollars in damages and its authors plan to create what they call an abatement fund to use for coverage of future damages, the Reuters report also noted.

On Sunday, Newsom called the damage already done “incalculable”.

The state of California has been at the forefront of the energy transition, sporting the highest fuel prices in the nation and also the biggest EV market. California is also a major electricity importer from other states and an oil importer, too.

Earlier this year, Governor Newsom signed a bill for the ban of internal combustion engine vehicles from 2035 in California, following in the footsteps of the European Union and the UK, both with their own ICE car bans in the works.

In comments on the lawsuit, Chevron said “Climate change is a global problem that requires a coordinated international policy response, not piecemeal litigation for the benefit of lawyers and politicians.”

“Its local courts have no constructive or constitutionally permissible role in crafting global energy policy,” a company spokesman also said, as quoted by Bloomberg.

The slave trade in Ukraine has become one of the most serious problems of our time. Since the 2014 coup d’état, Kiev has been a key player in modern slavery, particularly for human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks. The political and social instability that has affected the country since the Western-led regime change operation is one of the main factors for the growth of such human rights violations.

A recent investigative report published by the Foundation to Battle Injustice showed in details the seriousness of the slave trade in Ukraine. According to the organization, Kiev has become one of the main global hubs in the human trafficking market, with free exploitation and circulation of irregular workers – in addition to the well-known trafficking of women and children in the predatory sex market.

The study points out that more than 300,000 Ukrainians were victims of the slave market between 1991 and 2021. This situation, however, has deteriorated even further since Vladimir Zelensky came to power. It is estimated that since the beginning of Zelensky’s government, more than 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved. These numbers are alarming and place Ukraine as one of the main agents of human trafficking in the entire world.

In its report, citing sources familiar with the topic and several insiders, the Foundation exposed how the slave trade in Ukraine is not limited to the exploitation of Ukrainian citizens. Since 2021, two reception centers for refugees from Africa have been operating in Ternopil. These facilities were used not only for receiving migrants but also for selling them on the European black market. An alleged member of the Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet, on condition of anonymity, reported to investigators that the organizer of the Ukrainian human trafficking network is Ruslan Stefanchuk, current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.

It is said that Stefanchuk is the main beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, working both in the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and in the exploitation of foreigners who arrive through migratory flows and are handed over to criminal networks in Europe. Relatives of the Ukrainian parliamentarian also appear to be involved in such activities, as a large network of private companies is legally registered in the name of people close to him, such as his brother, Mykola Stefanchuck, and his wife, Marina Stefanchuk.

Stefanchuk and his relatives’ companies have the function of disguising the slave trade, making it appear to be a legal business. Advertisements are made to “help” people in various ways, such as offering employment or financial assistance. Thus, migrants, refugees and vulnerable Ukrainians are lured into meetings and interviews by supposedly legal and responsible companies, but soon after the meetings their documents are confiscated, and these people are captured and handed over to criminal networks.

“Everything is built to look as legal as possible. Ukrainian women, children and men are invited for interviews at respectable companies in Kiev, Ternopil, Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk. They are made tempting financial offers and paradisiacal working conditions. Then, under a plausible pretext, their identity cards are confiscated. After that, they can do absolutely anything they want with them,” source told investigators.

This type of situation is not surprising. In Ukraine, several crimes are committed with impunity by high-ranking state officials. Illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, military enlistment of children and even organ trafficking have been frequently reported in the country. It is worth remembering the case of Vasily Prozorov, a former Ukrainian secret service agent who emigrated to Russia and has done important work exposing Kiev’s crimes. According to him, there is a criminal network of trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian children in pedophile schemes in which Western officials are deeply involved.

 BERLIN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Climate activists from the Last Generation environmental group staged nationwide protests in Germany on Friday against the government's transport policy by disrupting traffic in 26 cities.

The members of the group are known in Germany as Klimakleber (climate stickers) as they are frequently gluing themselves to roads and infrastructure to block traffic and gain attention. In the capital Berlin, for example, the main traffic circle around the Victory Column was blocked in this way.

The activists accuse the government of ""breaking its own climate law,"" arguing that the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) refused to present an emergency climate protection program as required by German law.

While Germany met its overall emission reduction target in 2022, the transport sector slightly increased its emissions compared to the previous year, according to the Federal Environment Agency (UBA).

Internationally, transport is also failing to deliver on climate change mitigation, as global decarbonization measures would currently only lead to a 3 percent reduction in emissions in the sector by 2050, according to the International Transport Forum (ITF).

The transport sector would ""miss by a wide margin the reduction needed to keep climate change in check,"" the ITF warned in May.

To meet the Paris Agreement's net-zero target by 2050, transport-related CO2 emissions would need to fall by at least 3 percent annually until 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned.

The activists' measures are not supported by a majority of Germany's population, sometimes even provoking violent reactions. Earlier this week, a truck driver drove into an activist. Although no one was injured, the driver could now lose his license.

On Thursday, the group already blocked two major airports in the middle of the summer vacation season, preventing flights from taking off or landing for hours.

Sound familiar?

Without the direct knowledge, say-so, or approval of the ailing US President, a group of senior Washington officials plan in top secrecy to persuade Germany to recover all the eastern European territories which the German Army took in World War II – including Austria, the Czech Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor, and the western region of Ukraine known as Galicia. In return, the Germans should agree to resuming their war against Russia on US terms.

This was known in Washington as the M PROJECT. It was devised by a group of American co-religionists, with a common ethnic origin and a shared belief in the evil of everything Russia stood for, including their religion.

The M PROJECT was the brainchild of the head of US intelligence, the White House military advisor, and other generals and admirals. They were all Irish-American Roman Catholics.

Through a special emissary code-named DAISY, they attempted to recruit their German co-religionists in the plan. To earn their reward, the Germans’ job was to arrange a coup d’état in Berlin; kill Adolph Hitler; and hurry up, before the Russian Army made good its advance through Ukraine, Poland, and on to Berlin.

This was the M PROJECT of 1943. President Franklin Roosevelt knew nothing of it. It failed, but the secret was kept for more than thirty years. By then, the US didn’t need to persuade the Germans by killing their chancellor. They do have a problem this week, though, to compel the new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to join the M&M PROJECT – that’s the old M PROJECT modernized by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his deputy Victoria Nuland, for a new push through the Ukraine front.

The Germans must hurry this time too. The M&M PROJECT is due to start on Tuesday this week, according to Bloomberg. The Times of London says it will be Wednesday. The White House national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, an Irish-American, says it will be “any day now.”

On Friday, this and a great many preceding and succeeding murder plots and invasions devised by US officials will be exposed in the new book from Dances with Bears.

 Facts and data show “three strikes and climate alarmism should be out,” climate truth-teller Steve Milloy told PJ Media. “But it’s still at bat and swinging,” propped up by the “fake news media.”

Junk Science’s Milloy explained the three biggest truths undermining the mainstream narrative in exclusive comments to PJ Media. [emphasis, links added]

“We are 35 years into climate alarmism, and we’ve had no global warming since 2015 despite 450 billion tons of emissions; no type of natural disaster correlates with emissions or warming; and no apocalyptic climate prediction has ever come true,” Milloy stated.

It’s time to admit the fraud.

“That’s three strikes and climate alarmism should be out. But it’s still at bat and swinging because the fake news media shares its leftist agenda and will not call it out,” Milloy added.

After all, governments can use climate change as a convenient excuse for increasing their power and control.

Milloy’s comments followed the publication of a new report.

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), The Heartland Institute, the Energy & Environmental (E&E) Legal Institute, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, the International Climate Science Coalition, and Truth in Energy and Climate issued their “Climate Fact Check: September 2023 Edition.” Milloy posted the report at ClimateRealism.com.

The first myth the groups attacked was the media apocalypse prophesying on “global warming.” They looked at data to determine if September did have record heat.

Based on NASA satellite data, September 2023 had the highest temperature anomaly (i.e., difference from average) on record. It was 0.9C warmer than the 1991-2020 average.

In contrast, the Temperature.global compilation of actual temperature measurements from surface stations has September only slightly warmer than the average monthly temperature of the past 8 years and 9 months, and far from the warmest month since January 2015.

Which data is more accurate and reliable? “NASA admits the surface stations are. There has still been no global warming since January 2015,” the report insisted. [That’s “because they directly measure the temperature where people reside”]

It also stated that “average global temperature” is “not an actual physical metric,” but merely a “flawed notion” used to fuel climate alarmism.

The report analyzed and fact-checked multiple media claims about the past month’s weather. Did the huge downpour in New York City break records and was it due to climate change?

No, the groups said, citing the New York Times’s records to disprove the claims.

As The New York Times asserted, is rainfall across the country becoming “more fearsome” due to global warming? The problem with that claim is that warmer air doesn’t cause “more intense rainfall,” the groups explained.

Are Alpine glaciers melting at a concerning rate? Perhaps, but it’s not because of man-made “emissions;” the report noted that the Alps were free of ice thousands of years ago, and the current receding has been ongoing for years, before modern industrial society.

The report further fact-checked claims around hurricanes, Antarctic ice, emissions and the “hottest summer” propaganda, Norwegian glaciers, and allegedly human-driven global warming.

It ends by providing context to an analysis supposedly proving man-driven global warming. If you add in the warming caused by “the series of El Niños,” it’s highly questionable that fossil fuels have warmed Earth “to any discernible extent.”

In fact, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data showed earlier this year that there hadn’t been global warming for eight years.

The “climate crisis” is an unscientific political crock.

 THIS is the astonishing moment a Ukrainian armoured vehicle bravely takes on a vastly more powerful Russian tank in a ferocious firefight - and WINS.

The astounding video filmed from a drone appears to show a Ukrainian BTR-4 raining hell on the invaders' tank in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine.

The BTR-4 appears to unload a volley of rounds from its 30mm cannon causing severe damage to Putin's war machine - despite it having 40mm armour.

Rounds can be seen streaking through the air in the dramatic David and Goliath struggle.

And after pounding what is believed to be a Russian T-72 tank - a ferocious inferno engulfs and then obliterates it leaving the machine in tatters.

The humiliating scenes come despite Putin's battle tanks being fitted with 125mm cannons - more than FOUR TIMES the size of a BTR-4.

Its main gun can fire armour-piercing shells and highly explosive rounds.

It can also launch AT-11 laser guided anti-tank missiles.

But the 44.5 tonne tanks are less mobile and quick to aim than nippy troop carriers like the BTR-4, whose cannons can rapid-fire.

The T-72 and other variants of it has seen extensive use on both sides in the war in the Donbas since 2014 and the Russo-Ukrainian.

Most read in World News

It is a family of Soviet/Russian main battle tanks that entered production in 1969.

Latest estimates suggest Putin's savages have now lost an eyewatering 756 battle tanks since the war began on February 24.

That comes alongside estimates that Russia has lost an astonishing 20,000 men in just 50-days of war.

They have also seen 163 planes and 144 helicopters blasted out the sky above war ravaged Ukraine.

Russia's latest military humiliation comes as the Kremlin redeploys forces eastward after a disaster campaign to take the capital Kyiv.

REDEPLOYMENT

Putin is now focusing efforts in the Donbas region which has been gripped by war between government forces and pro-Russian separatists since 2014.

Russia annexed Crimea the same year and recognize the independence of the rebel regions in the Donbas.

Moscow now intends to forge a strategic corridor between Crimea and its own sovereign territory via the Donbas.

It means roads such as the one shown in the video will remain scenes of intense fighting for months to come.

It comes as the Russian military continues to move helicopters and other equipment together for such an effort, according to a senior U.S. defence official.

And worryingly it is likely to insert more ground combat units in the region once it has regrouped after shouldering massive losses.

But it's unclear precisely when Russia will launch a bigger offensive in the Donbas.

It comes as Russia's flagship Moskva was sunk after an extraordinary missile attack by the Ukrainians.

HUMILIATION

The ship - a 40-year-old symbol of Russian military might - was left a smouldering wreck after taking direct hits from two Neptune anti-ship missiles.

The ship later sunk as it was being towed to naval port Sevastopol in Crimea.

First Rank Captain Anton Kuprin, 44, was killed after the ship was hammered by the missiles, according to Kyiv sources.

It has been alleged that only around 50 of the crew are accounted for - having been picked up by a Turkish vessel.

While another 14 were reportedly flown to the port of Sevastopol, leaving around 450 whose fates remain a mystery.

Video from within in Sevastopol overnight shows dozens of cars purportedly belonging to the sailors still parked in the port - suggesting their owners haven't come to collect them.

The sinking of the Soviet-era Moskva in the Black Sea prompted Russia to launch a furious retaliation, later claiming to have blitzed the factory which made the missiles that sunk their prized flagship.

The defence ministry said it had rocketed the 'Vizar' plant on the edge of Kyiv on Thursday night which it says manufactures Neptune anti-ship missiles.

Russian Vladimir Putin, craving bloody revenge for the sinking, then ordered a brutal new bombing campaign promising more strikes against the Ukrainian capital.

In a statement, Russia defence ministry said: ""The number and scale of missile strikes on targets in Kyiv will increase in response to any terrorist attacks or acts of sabotage on Russian territory committed by the Kyiv nationalist regime.""

Strikes later rocked the capital Kyiv on Thursday night, according to Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko.

Social media videos have shown the sky above Kyiv lit up by countless explosions - they appear to be the most serious attacks since Russia retreated from the capital earlier this month.

While blasts were also heard in the southern city of Kherson, the eastern city of Kharkiv and in Ukraine's western city of Ivano-Frankivsk.

She only looks at the financial side, but we all know, no farmers, no food. We are a major exporter of our products so this has an effect worldwide.

Trump is NOT on our side for those who forgot his operation warpspeed with the plan of military involvement. In his current campaign he even talks about so-called freedom cities. Do not be fooled, these are AI generated concentration camps!

Military presence is something they want us to get used to. It is not anti terrorism, it is anti citizens.

 My publisher contacted me this week, drawing attention to a Wall Street Journal article claiming climate change is producing shortages of “the finer things in life,” like wine, coffee, cocoa, and olive oil. [emphasis, links added]

The implication was clear: your carbon footprint is causing the price of these commodities to sharply rise.

“Total bull-bleep,” I replied.

Specifically, the story speaks of the recent drought in West Africa, which has resulted in a cocoa shortage; dry spells in Vietnam, which have reduced coffee harvests; and parched Italian olive groves and grape vineyards, which were recently destroyed by wildfires.

None of these meteorological events has anything to do with the use of fossil fuels and the subsequent release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

The truth is that these regions of the world are historically well-known for witnessing wild swings in otherwise natural weather patterns.

As I explain repeatedly in my new book Climate Cult: Exposing and Defeating Their War on Life, Liberty, and Property, such misinformation feeds into an elaborate propaganda campaign designed to frighten the developed world into demanding a carbon-neutral energy grid that would be about as reliable North Korea’s.

Let’s begin with West Africa, where the climate periodically exhibits large spatial and temporal variabilities that allow for recurrent droughts, some lasting hundreds of years.

In fact, the past couple of years of dry weather pales in comparison to the West African droughts in the 1970s and ’80s.

As for cocoa production, a reality missing from the discussion is that global consumers are demanding more cocoa than ever, so a blip in production impacts retail price and availability like never before.

The recent drought in Vietnam is quite serious, but I’m happy to report it’s not being caused by your SUV.

While the lack of rain in parts of Southeast Asia is the worst since the 1930s (a decade which remains the hottest on record throughout much of the world), the drought is associated with an El Nino weather pattern.

El Nino and its sister La Nina are ancient occurrences that possess the dynamics to both enhance or diminish precipitation, depending on a variety of quite ordinary atmospheric circumstances.

Wildfires feeding on extremely dry vegetation have certainly taken a recent toll on olive groves in Italy and drought has impacted wine production there as well.

The journal Nature recently published a study claiming, “Climate change is affecting grape yield, composition, and wine quality. As a result, the geography of wine production is changing.” However, the publication’s editorial bias seems to have caused them to ignore the historical record.

The worst drought in modern Italy occurred in the 1920s. However, going back further, that region’s most catastrophic precipitation deficiency began in the 1530s and lasted the better part of a decade.

It was so extreme that Protestant reformer Martin Luther wondered if it was a sign of the end times. Clergy in Germany, Italy, and England urged the people to beg God for forgiveness and pray for the deliverance of rain.

As I explain in my book, those pushing the climate agenda employ ad hominem arguments that appeal to raw emotions rather than intellect.

And, as I also detail, those on the left aren’t fond of examining history. For them, Karl Marx stated it best in his 1844 book, The Holy Family: “History does nothing; it possesses no immense wealth; it wages no battles.”

 We accept the named legislation “Inflation Reduction Act” (IRA) is a legislative misnomer intended to obfuscate the true construct of the bill. The IRA was factually the ‘green new deal’ program packaged under the guise of an ‘inflation reduction’ premise. However, in order to discuss the outcome of the content we have to play the game of pretending around the purpose of the legislation.

Within the IRA there was a $7,500 tax credit for American made Electric Vehicles. The intent of the legislation was to provide incentives for U.S. consumers to purchase ‘sustainable’ and environmentally friendly electric cars, trucks, SUV’s etc made in America.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) scored the bill with this legislative intent in mind. However, the Treasury Department is now taking apart the granular details of the legislation in order to qualify foreign made vehicles for the $7,500 credit. The rules interpretation from the Treasury Dept essentially negates the CBO score, and the outcome is going to be much more expensive than initially stated.

Because the $7,500 comes in the form of a tax credit, the IRS (Treasury) is the institution making the determinations for qualification. Treasury is changing the qualifications to permit basically any EV to qualify, by parsing a difference between a leased vehicle and a purchased vehicle. Additionally, Treasury is changing the battery sourcing aspect by qualifying essentially any trade agreement as a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), saying the term Free Trade Agreement was undefined in the legislation.

As an outcome & simply cutting to the chase, EV batteries from just about anywhere, inside EV vehicles from basically anywhere, that are purchased as leases from just about any auto manufacturer, will qualify for the $7,500 credit. It’s all a shell game, with the Biden administration determining where the pea is located.

Dec 29 (Reuters) – The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday that electric vehicles leased by consumers starting Jan. 1 can qualify for up to $7,500 in commercial clean vehicle tax credits, a decision that makes those assembled outside North America eligible.

The announcement is a win for South Korea and some automakers that earlier this month sought approval to use the commercial electric vehicle tax credit to boost consumer EV access. Automakers said the credit could be used to reduce leasing prices.

The $430 billion U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August ended $7,500 consumer tax credits for purchases of electric vehicles assembled outside North America, angering South Korea, the European Union, Japan and others. The new Treasury guidance does not change the definition of what constitutes North American assembly to make more vehicles eligible for EV purchases.

Treasury said it was using “longstanding tax principles” to determine consumer leasing could qualify for the EV tax credit.

The IRA also imposes significant battery minerals and component sourcing restrictions, sets income and price caps for qualifying vehicles and seeks to phase out Chinese battery minerals or components. The commercial credit does not, however, have the sourcing restrictions of the consumer credit.

Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat who chairs the chamber’s energy panel, urged Treasury to pause implementation of both commercial and new consumer EV tax credits and said they had bent “to the desires of the companies looking for loopholes” and would seek new legislation that “prevents this dangerous interpretation from Treasury from moving forward.” (read more)

From the Wall Street Journal, “One of the documents released Thursday pointed out that because the legislation doesn’t define what a free-trade agreement is, the Treasury Department might consider other types of trade agreements to expand the eligibility. The department didn’t provide examples of such agreements, but trade lawyers have suggested that the 2019 bilateral trade agreement with Japan and the World Trade Organization’s government procurement agreement could be candidates.” (link)

I am reminded of the words from Democrat Congressman Alcee Hastings during the construction of the ObamaCare legislation. WATCH (10 secs):

.

Once again using language to obscure reality.

It is a funny thing to see the BS passed into law and then the Treasury department”deciding” who gets the taxpayer money as an incentive to buy a car made with Cobalt mined by slaves in Africa.

Indentured slaves, but non the less, it’s children doing the mining, yet it’s for the environment.

EN_UA_300058.txt,Other,Other,"Russia Turns Missiles on Ukraine's Farm Storage 

 Russian cruise missiles, flying low and hugging the terrain to dodge Ukrainian air defenses, destroyed farm storage buildings in the Odesa region early Friday, Ukrainian officials said, as the Kremlin’s forces expanded their targets following three days of bombardment of the region’s Black Sea port infrastructure.

Two missiles struck the storage facility, starting a fire, and while workers fought to put it out another missile hit, destroying farm and firefighting equipment, the southern Odesa region’s Gov. Oleh Kiper said.

The attack injured two people and destroyed 100 metric tons of peas and 20 metric tons of barley, according to Kiper.

The attack was small-scale in comparison with barrages in recent days that put Odesa in Russia’s crosshairs after Moscow tore up a wartime deal that allowed Ukraine to send grain through the key Black Sea port.

Russia targeted Ukrainian critical grain export infrastructure after vowing to retaliate for an attack that damaged a crucial bridge between Russia and the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula.

Though Friday’s strike was more muted, the recent uptick in attacks has kept people in Odesa on edge.

“The enemy is continuing terror, and it’s undoubtedly related to the grain deal,” said Natalia Humeniuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian military’s Operational Command South.

Both Russia and Ukraine have announced that they will treat ships traveling to each other’s Black Sea ports as potential military targets.

The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, said the recent barrages in southern Ukraine are part of an overarching strategy.

“The Russian military’s intensifying strikes against Ukrainian port and grain infrastructure and threats of maritime escalation are likely a part of a Kremlin effort to leverage Russia’s exit from the Black Sea Grain Initiative and exact extensive concessions from the West,” it said in an assessment late Thursday.

The Russian Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the navy conducted drills that simulated action to seal off a section of the Black Sea.

In the maneuvers, a missile boat fired anti-ship cruise missiles at a mock target in the northwestern part of the Black Sea.

In other developments, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced the resignation of the country’s Culture Minister, suggesting the ministry’s spending was misguided during wartime.

“Paving stones, city decorations, and fountains can wait till after the victory,” he said.

The move follows a series of recent scandals related to the expenditure of local authorities across the country, such as the repair of a cobblestone road in Kyiv’s city center or a renovation of a city fountain in a western Ukraine city.

 Letters to the Editor: Oil companies are killing the planet. Now they want to sell us a fake solution?

To the editor: Let’s recognize “carbon management” for what it is — a fossil fuel industry euphemism for commodifying pollution and providing life support to this dirty industry. While urgent action is needed to address the climate emergency, carbon capture is not a real solution. (“Will storing CO2 in old oil fields slow global warming? First California plan nears approval,” Jan. 14)

The process in question requires vast amounts of energy and water. The presence of oil wells and pipelines can result in dangerous and potentially deadly leaks. That’s especially true of improperly plugged wells in the oilfields that companies like California Resources Corp. want to use as carbon dumping grounds.

Carbon capture and storage projects divert funds away from what is truly needed: a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and rooftop solar.

Rather than marking “a drastic transformation for fossil fuel companies” and communities, as oil industry supporters claim, carbon management is nothing more than corporate greenwashing intended to keep these polluting companies in business.

..

To the editor: Let me see if I understand this correctly.

California Resources Corp. wants to utilize its depleted oil fields to store carbon emissions deep underground. This company polluted California for decades, for profit, and now it wants to utilize the same ground that is basically a wasteland of little to no value to store carbon emissions that resulted from the extraction of its product in the first place.

The company made unbelievable amounts of money extracting fossil fuels that have resulted in the loss of many lives through their detrimental effects on the environment. Now, it wants to be part of the solution by profiting from the removal of the very same environmental toxins.

I think California Resources Corp. could pay for this sequestration itself in an attempt to mitigate the horrid effects it’s had on the human population over the decades. But then again, there would be no profit in that.

 Russia is planning to hold war games near Ireland’s coast in international waters, which are “not welcome,” Ireland’s foreign minister said on Jan. 24 amid heightened tensions near the Russia–Ukraine border.

“This isn’t a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what’s happening with and in Ukraine,” Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told reporters.

Coveney said the exercises are slated to take place about 150 miles off Ireland’s southwest coast within its airspace and exclusive economic zone.

“The fact that they are choosing to do it on the western borders, if you like, of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that in our view is simply not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks,” Coveney said.

He added that Ireland doesn’t have the “power to prevent this happening but, certainly, I’ve made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it’s not welcome.”

The remarks come as Russia has massed an estimated 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s border, demanding that Ukraine not join NATO. Russia also has denied it is planning an invasion, and it says the Western accusations are merely a cover for NATO’s own planned provocations.

Russia invaded Ukraine to annex the Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Meanwhile, Moscow also backed pro-Russian separatists fighting in the eastern portion of the country known as the Donbas.

NATO will “take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies,” said Jens Stoltenberg, the alliance’s secretary-general. “We will always respond to any deterioration of our security environment, including through strengthening our collective defense.”

But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed the United States and NATO for sword-rattling and fear-mongering.

“All this is happening not because of what we, Russia, are doing. This is happening because of what NATO, the U.S. are doing,” Peskov told reporters, citing what he described as false reports that Russia is allegedly evacuating diplomats from Ukraine.

 Biden to ask for extra funds for Israel, Ukraine wars

WASHINGTON (NewsNation) — President Joe Biden will ship his fourth prime-time deal with to the nation Thursday evening in an effort to pitch the American public on the necessity to proceed funding the wars in Israel and Ukraine.

Israel continues to pound the Gaza Strip with airstrikes, together with within the south the place Palestinians have been informed to take refuge. The long-expected floor invasion has not but occurred, however the nation’s protection minister has informed troops to “be prepared” to invade.

Palestinian militants fired rockets into Israel on Thursday from Gaza and Lebanon, and tensions flared within the Israeli-occupied West Financial institution.

Biden’s funding request is more likely to be round $100 billion over the subsequent 12 months, in line with folks straight accustomed to the proposal who insisted on anonymity to debate inner deliberations.

A senior White Home official informed The Related Press that Biden continued to develop his remarks on Thursday after working with shut aides all through the week, together with on his flight house from Israel. The official declined to be recognized forward of the president’s speech.

The Gaza Well being Ministry mentioned 3,785 folks have been killed in Gaza because the warfare started, nearly all of them girls, kids and older adults. Practically 12,500 others have been injured, and one other 1,300 folks have been believed buried underneath the rubble, well being authorities mentioned.

Greater than 1,400 folks in Israel have been killed, largely civilians slain throughout Hamas’ lethal incursion on Oct. 7. Roughly 200 others have been kidnapped. The Israeli army mentioned Thursday it had notified the households of 203 captives.

With reference to the warfare additional east, the White Home has warned that point is working out to forestall Ukraine, which not too long ago struggled to make progress in a grueling counteroffensive, from dropping floor to Russia due to dwindling provides of weapons.

A Russian missile assault killed two civilians in an condo constructing in southern Ukraine on Wednesday, native authorities mentioned, as President Vladimir Putin dismissed the significance of a brand new U.S.-supplied weapon that Kyiv used to execute one of the vital damaging assaults on the Kremlin’s air property because the begin of the warfare.

Putin informed reporters that Russia “will be capable of repel” additional assaults by the U.S.-made Military Tactical Missile System, often called ATACMS.

Biden hopes that combining each of those points into one piece of laws will create the required political coalition for congressional approval.

Nevertheless it gained’t be simple.

Biden faces an array of steep challenges as he tries to safe the cash. The Home stays in chaos as a result of the Republican majority has been unable to pick a speaker to exchange Rep. Kevin McCarthy, who was ousted greater than two weeks in the past.

Discussions on giving interim Home Speaker Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., the authority to handle legislative affairs and conduct flooring votes — an unprecedented transfer — have intensified because the Home is and not using a everlasting chief at a vital time for Congress.

Biden’s speech shall be delivered from the Oval Workplace at 8:00 pm ET.

Biden’s earlier prime-time addresses to the nation included when the U.S. narrowly averted a nationwide debt default and on the anniversary of coronavirus lockdowns. His first was to deal with the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who was discovered responsible of murdering George Floyd.

EN_UA_300066.txt,Other,Other,"WH: Support for Ukraine Still Strong, Despite Progressives' Letter to Biden 

 The White House said Tuesday that United States' support for Ukraine's war efforts would ""remain strong,"" despite the Congressional Progressive Caucus's signed memo urging President Joe Biden to establish diplomatic talks with Russia.

""Our support for Ukraine will remain strong until the end of this war,"" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.

On Monday, the House Progressives signed a letter challenging Biden's handling of Ukraine and requested the White House engage in diplomacy discussions with Russia, in hopes of ending the ongoing war between the neighboring countries.

And earlier today, amid backlash from other congressional Democrats, the Progressives rescinded their memo-driven request to the Biden White House.

Regarding the White House's role in Ukraine and Russia theoretically ending the war, minus more violence or destruction, Jean-Pierre said that's up to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy — and not the Biden administration.

""Our job, as we see it today, as we've seen it for this past year — more than a year — is to make sure that Ukraine has what it needs on the ground, as we see this war happening in Ukraine,"" said Jean-Pierre.

""We're doing this to strengthen their hand, not just on the battlefield, but if they choose, if Ukraine chooses to negotiate,"" she added.

According to The Hill, the House Progressives had been working on their bold political stance since the summer, but waited to craft a public notice until a sizable number of total Democrats signed on for the call to action.

That rationale unwittingly fueled the uproar among congressional Democrats.

""They waited to get about 30 [people] and released,"" one anonymous source texted The Hill on Tuesday, without going into greater detail about the sensitivity of internal negotiations. ""Didn't consider election timing.""

As Newsmax chronicled Tuesday, the House Progressives' memo offered initial praise to Biden for providing financial and logistical support to Ukraine's self-defense efforts.

However, the CPC also demanded ""vigorous"" diplomatic efforts in support of a negotiated settlement and ceasefire, through ""direct talks with Russia.""

And that included certain measures to protect a ""free and independent"" Ukraine, according to reports.

The Republicans have yet to offer a formal response to reports of internal Democrat disagreements over the last two days.

However, that didn't preclude Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., also the CPC chairwoman, from deflecting some heat toward GOP leadership.

""Because of the timing, our message is being conflated by some as being equivalent to the recent statement by Republican Leader McCarthy threatening an end to aid to Ukraine if Republicans take over,"" said Jayapal, referring to recent remarks from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., pledging that a GOP-controlled House would not give a ""blank check"" to Ukraine.

 Former Vice President Mike Pence fired back on social media after an out-of-context video clip of him suggesting he’s more interested in the war in Ukraine than issues plaguing cities across the US went viral on Friday.

In the video, former Fox News host Tucker Carlson questions the 2024 Republican presidential candidate about where his priorities lie after Pence criticizes the length of time it has taken the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with weapons to fend off Russia’s invasion of the former Soviet state.

“You are distressed that the Ukrainians don’t have enough American tanks. Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.

“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.

To which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”

Several conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”

The former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.

“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.

In the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth. We can do both.

“And as president of the United States, we will secure our border, we will support our military, we will revive our economy and stand by our values. And we will also lead the world for freedom under my administration. I promise you.”

Pence made an unannounced visit to Kyiv late last month and became the first declared 2024 Republican contender to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The 64-year-old made the trip with Samaritan’s Purse, an evangelical Christian humanitarian organization that the former vice president previously accompanied to Poland and Ukraine, a Pence adviser said.

“I really do believe that if Vladimir Putin and the Russian military were to overrun Ukraine, it wouldn’t be too long before they cross the border where our men and women would be required to fight,” Pence, an outspoken backer of the Ukrainian war effort and providing US military support for the country, told NBC News in June.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Overpraising the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene']",pence call viral clip suggest care ukraine fake news vice president mike pence fire social medium context video clip suggest interested war ukraine issue plague city go viral friday video fox news host tucker carlson question republican presidential candidate priority lie penny criticize length time take biden administration provide ukraine weapon fend russia invasion soviet state distressed ukrainians don american tank city united states bad past year drive city get well united states visible carlson say forum family leadership summit iowa economy degrade suicide rate jump public filth disorder crime exponentially increase concern ukrainians country people find map ve receive ten billion tax dollar don tank think fair question ask like concern united states carlson ask pence pence respond concern tucker ve hear routine concern conservative social medium seize clip include turn point usa founder charlie kirk share snippet exchange twitter write tucker carlson brutalize mike pence prioritize ukraine despite litany social ill afflict america vice president shoot kirk social medium share clip answer carlson show explain pence administration country able tackle issue affect ukraine domestic problem time sorry charlie kirk fake news clip remark interested penny write tweet extended clip penny continue response carlson say anybody say leader free world solve problem home pretty small view great nation earth president united states secure border support military revive economy stand value lead world freedom administration promise penny unannounced visit kyiv late month declare republican contender meet ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky -year old trip samaritan purse evangelical christian humanitarian organization vice president previously accompany poland ukraine pence adviser say believe vladimir putin russian military overrun ukraine wouldn long cross border man woman require fight penny outspoken backer ukrainian war effort provide military support country tell nbc news june

 A bill set to go before the Senate during the current period gives corporations the green light to continue greenwashing their financial statements for the next three years, environmental advocates say.

The government's current bill to force corporations to disclose their climate risk includes a clause that gives businesses legal immunity from private claims brought against false or misleading climate statements for three years from January 2025.

During his first reading of the bill, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the three-year transition period acknowledged that making climate disclosures for the first time would be ""challenging"" for some businesses.

""ASIC can still take action for breaches of the reporting requirements during this period,"" he said.

However, many businesses already report their climate risks, particularly large public corporations and major emitters, after sustained shareholder pressure.

Director of corporate climate NGO Climate Integrity Claire Snyder said the immunity period opened the door to misleading statements from corporations about their emissions reductions plans.

""Three years of legal immunity would give a greenlight to continue greenwashing in company reporting and delay urgently needed climate action,"" Ms Snyder said.

Australia's corporate regulators have recently been taking action on greenwashing by major corporations, after a 2023 survey by the ACCC found half of businesses had made misleading statements about their environmental credentials.

Earlier this month, financial superannuation Mercer paid $11.3 million in the first greenwashing case brought by corporate enforcer ASIC.

However despite this and other actions against Vanguard Investments and Active Super, there are concerns that ASIC does not have the resources to pursue corporate greenwashing cases, given the widespread nature of the issue.

Greens senator Nick McKim said the immunity period was too long.

""ASIC being the gatekeeper does not fill us with confidence as they hardly have a reputation as a tough cop on the beat,"" he said.

A recent Senate inquiry found ASIC had ""comprehensively failed"" to fulfil its regulatory remit and was ""reluctant or unwilling"" to commence investigations into misconduct.

The Greens have proposed an amendment to the bill to reduce the legal immunity period to one year.

ACT senator David Pocock, in additional comments to a Senate review of the bill, said there was no time to waste in holding large emitters to account.

""Given the decades of lost opportunity to address the impacts of climate change in this country, we simply don't have the luxury of time any more to dispense liability holidays to large fossil fuel producers and emitters, especially absent any good articulated reason to do so.""

 Reporter who helped reveal assassination plot on Putin opposition figure Navalny ‘BANNED’ from BAFTAs

A REPORTER who helped to reveal the plot to murder Russian dissident Alexei Navalny has been ""banned"" from attending this weekend's BAFTAs.

Christo Grozev features in the 2022 film Navalny, which has been nominated for Best Documentary at the awards ceremony.

The film follows the story of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny's poisoning in 2020 - and the subsequent efforts of Grozev and fellow investigative journalist Maria Pevchikh revealing the plot to kill the Russian opposition politician.

Navalny, one of Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, survived the attempt on his life with a deadly nerve agent.

He is currently serving sentences totalling eleven-and-a-half years on charges including fraud and contempt of court.

Taken aback by the ruling, Grozev took to Twitter on Friday to inform his followers.

He said: ""I was surprised to discover that my whole family and I have all been banned by British police from attending this weekend's Bafta awards where the documentary #Navalny is nominated.

""The reason stated: 'We represent a public security risk'.

""I understand the need to keep the public safe (although I don't understand how my son or teenage daughter constitute risk to the public). But moments like this show the growing dangers to independent journalists around the world.

""These dangers don't stem just from murderous dictators, but also from having journalists' voices hushed - instead of amplified - by the civilised world they are trying to serve.""

In response to Grozev's online remarks, Met Police said that police forces generally ""do not and cannot"" ban individuals from attending events, and the decision will rest with the show's organisers.

Despite hand-wringing about ""hostile intentions of foreign states"" in the UK, Met Police said it could not comment on an individual's safety.

A statement read: ""We cannot comment on the safety of an individual or the advice they may have been given.

""However, the situation that journalists face around the world and the fact that some journalists face the hostile intentions of foreign states whilst in the UK is a reality that we are absolutely concerned with.

""We are committed to working with our intelligence partners to investigate these threats and to take other steps to ensure the safety of those concerned.""

The Met added: ""Despite our efforts, on protective security and on investigations, we recognise the impact of those threats on those affected.

""The responsibility for such threats and their potential impact on the wider public lies with the hostile state actors behind them and we have significantly increased the resources applied to bearing down on those.

""More generally, police do not and cannot ban anyone from attending a private event. Decisions about the attendance at an event is a matter for the event organisers.

""We recognise that our advice can mean organisers have difficult choices to make when deciding how best to mitigate any risks to the security of their event, and we are grateful for the ongoing engagement of Bafta.""

Christo Grozev is the lead Russia investigator for investigative group Bellingcat.

The Netherlands-based outfit's work focuses on “security threats, extraterritorial clandestine operations, and the weaponization of information,” according to their website.

Responding to Grozev's Twitter thread, Tory MP and chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Alicia Kearns responded: ""I've raised with ministers - you are not the security risk.""

In a statement given to the PA news agency regarding security at Sunday's ceremony, Bafta said: ""The safety of all our guests and staff at the ceremony is always our highest priority, and we have robust and appropriate security arrangements in place every year.""

Bafta also confirmed that the film's producers Diane Becker, Shane Boris, Melanie Miller and Odessa Rae will be in attendance as nominees for Navalny.

 Supposedly to prevent ""global warming"" and ""brain damage,"" Hochul and other left-wingers want only electric cooking appliances to be allowed in new construction. Were that to actually happen, cafes and other eateries would no longer be able to run their businesses.

""For 35 years, we've been attacked by everybody,"" Morfogen told Carlson. ""We had organized crime in our industry in the '30s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In the 2000s, we had corrupt Wall Street, and for the last three years we've had government overreach.""

""I mean, we've seen it during covid – they did things and never followed the science and what's going on. I heard a rumor about this last year, and what I'm hearing about today from the White House to Gov. Hochul, that they want to make us, for new restaurant construction, use electric stoves.""

Not only would gas stoves be banned in new construction under Hochul's plan, but so would gas heaters. Everyone would be forced to use costly and highly inefficient electric cooking and heating appliances, which would also place enormous strain on the electrical grid. (Related: In Europe, the ongoing energy crisis is causing some to have to burn wood for warm meals and heat.)

According to Hochul and other Democrats, the planet's climate is supposedly changing because of gas use. In order to stop the climate from changing, electric must be the only source of energy used – even if it comes from coal, ironically enough.

""So let me explain it to you: we lose 40 percent productivity by using electric,"" Morfogen further stated. ""If they inquire with small business owners, I'll give them three pieces of advice: get a stronger filtration system; get a hood system that works; and, basically, train your staff how to maintain it.""

Citing a single study claiming that gas stoves contribute to 12.7 percent of all cases of asthma in children, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is attempting to implement a nationwide ban on gas stoves – because freedom of choice is not one of that group's values.

""For 35 years, we continuously have obstacles in running our industry,"" Morfogen added during the interview.

""I've got to tell you, Tucker – and I want to thank you for supporting small business – since the last time I was on, you inspired me to write the book. And I've got to tell you, our journey is constantly being attacked, like, we're vulnerable and this is the crème de la crème, because I will tell you, this will destroy our industry just as bad as they attempted to do with covid.""

If you are interested in watching the Tucker Carlson segment featuring Morfogen, you can do so at this link.

Bearing the nickname ""Golden Greek,"" Morfogen has owned and operated a number of top restaurants in New York City – at least 41 of them, in fact. He told the New York Post last summer that thievery, economic downturns, demolition problems, and changing neighborhoods are among the many reasons why his restaurants have come and gone over the years.

""Our industry was then like the Wild West,"" he explained. ""There comes a knock on the door and you have to pay protection so the mob doesn't break your window or your manager's legs.""

The new mob, apparently, are Democrats and their ""green"" tyranny solutions to climate problems that are entirely nonexistent outside of their own deranged heads.

 Interview: China's green energy transition inspires countries worldwide: UNDP chief

DUBAI, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China's green energy transitions will contribute to the global fight against climate change and inspire other countries toward green transition, said Achim Steiner, head of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), in a recent interview with Xinhua.

In the interview during the 11th World Governments Summit recently held in Dubai, the UNDP administrator said China's development has been remarkable in so many respects, including poverty alleviation, and its investments in technology and the green transition.

""It is addressing some of the legacies of its rapid industrialization, the air pollution, and the cleaning up of water systems.""

China has made major commitments that it would strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, noted Steiner.

""These transitions will enable China to be both a contributor to a global response to climate change, but also with its technologies and policies will help many other countries including many developing countries to pivot forward into a green transition strategy.""

Also in the interview, Steiner highlighted China as the backbone of the international economic recovery.

His assessment comes as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects global growth to stay at 3.1 percent in 2024 and rise to 3.2 percent in 2025 while forecasting the Chinese economy to expand by 4.6 percent this year.

""The outlook on the global economy is in part also premised on China's own economic development.""

He noted that although there are many factors influencing China's recovery in terms of GDP growth, the Chinese economy is looking positive at the moment and the UNDP remains optimistic that a recovery path is on its way.

UNDP works in about 170 countries and territories, helping to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and exclusion, and build resilience so countries can sustain progress.

As the UN's development agency, UNDP plays a critical role in helping countries achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

""We see great potential for our future collaboration in China with the SDGs, including on the SDG innovation hubs that China is establishing and where we are collaborating.""

Asked about his priorities for UNDP in 2024, Steiner said the challenge of climate change remains a centerpiece of UNDP's work.

The 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) is planned to take place in Brazil between Nov. 10 and 21, 2025.

""We are today committed to working with countries across the world towards the Conference of the Parties next year in Brazil, when countries will present their new nationally determined contributions and national climate plans,"" he said.

 ARSENAL star Oleksandr Zinchenko has recalled the harrowing moment Russia began the invasion of his home country Ukraine.

The Gunners full-back has spoken passionately in the past about the war and the toll it has had on him and his nation as a whole.

Russian president Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

Now, nearly 18 months on from the beginning of the conflict, Zinchenko has spoken about his memories of how it started.

Speaking on Piers Morgan Uncensored, he said: ""My wife suddenly woke me up. And she said, ‘It started’. I said ‘What started?’ She was crying, you know, like flooding tears.

""I said 'What’s started, what’s wrong?' And she showed me the pictures of this invasion.""

Discussing his family and friends in Ukraine, he went on to add: ""I'm so worried about them. And I'll tell you what - the mentality of people they don't want to leave, they don't want to leave the country, even if they could.

""This is their homeland. And I would for sure, after [my] football career, I will be living in Ukraine, that's for sure. One million percent.

""I was there one week ago and as soon as I passed the border it's just my homeland, my place.""

Arsenal man Zinchenko also stated he would fight for his country on the front line - much like fellow sports stars Wladimir Klitschko, Oleksandr Usyk and Vasyl Lomachenko.

EN_UA_300000.txt,Other,Other,"Report: Putin Overhauls Economy for Prolonged War 

 Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared to overhaul the country's economy for a protracted war in Ukraine, The Hill reported Friday.

After reshuffling his cabinet, replacing Sergei Shoigu with economist Andrei Belousov as Moscow's defense chief, and the ousted Nikolai Patrushev with Shoigu as secretary of Russia's security council, the moves have spurred speculation that Putin is consolidating power, according to the report.

""Taken together, the shake-up promotes economic over military minds to sustain"" Putin's ""war machine across several years, as well as stamping out any threat of a possible usurper,"" one expert told The Hill.

These changes indicate that Putin is ""digging in for the long term"" on Ukraine, Mark Galeotti, the head of Mayak Intelligence consultancy, said.

""Essentially, this is pointing to a strategy of attrition and a willingness to take risks, take losses, while waiting for Ukraine to no longer have the capacity to fight and the West no longer the will to keep supporting it,"" Galeotti told The Hill.

“Putin has brought this delegation of both cabinet members and the heads of Russian banks and energy companies — and shaken up his cabinet just before his visit to the economic patron of his war in Ukraine, the Chinese Communist Party,” Jonathan Ward, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute think tank in Washington, told The Hill.

 The World Economic Forum-aligned Netherlands government has vowed to forcibly seize 600 farms deemed to be disrespecting the WEF’s green agenda.

Dutch farmers’ organizations have vowed to launch more protests in the Netherlands in response to advice from the government’s mediator, who has demanded the seizure and relocation of farming firms and the seizure of up to 600 farms deemed to be the heaviest nitrogen emitters.


The move by the Dutch government comes just weeks after Bill Gates was caught admitting the climate change agenda is a scam for the New World Order in a newly surfaced video in which he boasts that the term “clean energy” has “screwed up people’s minds.”

According to Gates, who was speaking to an audience of his inner circle, wind, solar, battery technology and other renewable energy sources might be fashionable, but they are NOT capable of solving climate change.

Breitbart report: Farmers Defence Force leader Mark Van den Oever announced this week that Dutch farmers will once again take to the streets after the government expressed its intentions to adopt the plan presented by former deputy prime minister Johan Remkes to meet the nitrogen standards demanded by the European Union.

Remkes, who has been serving as the chief mediator between farmers’ organizations and the government in the ongoing dispute over nitrogen emissions, laid out a plan last week that would see farms located close to protected environments forcibly relocated and a scheme for the government to seize up to 600 farms that emit the most nitrogen.

In response to the plan, Van den Oever said that the scheme was “completely wrong” and that the farmers of the nation would “give the old-fashioned gas again, count on that” — in reference to the widespread tractor protests by farmers over the summer.

The Farmers Defence Force leader said that ministers have ignored the concerns of farmers and that the globalist government of Prime Mnister Mark Rutte “imposes far too much on businesses”.

The plan to relocate farms has drawn particular ire from the organisation, with spokesman Sieta van Keimpema describing the measure as a “red line” for farmers.

Defending his proposals, Remkes said last week that, as a result of the European Union’s green agenda, “the Netherlands will be locked up because it will be legally almost impossible to issue permits. Not for houses, not for farms, not for roads.”

“I write this with a heavy heart, but I see no other way,” he said, adding: “I don’t expect the agricultural sector will be happy with this report.”

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced his intentions to cut nitrogen emissions from livestock farms in half by the year 2030 in order to satisfy goals laid out in the European Union’s Natura 2000 scheme, which requires that all EU member-states remove industry or farming from areas deemed to be of ecological importance.

The government has asserted to meet the EU goals, some farms may have to reduce their emissions by as much as 95 per cent and that up to 30 per cent of all livestock farms may be shut down permanently.

Following the announcement of the scheme, thousands of farmers staged protests throughout the country, with tractors being used to block highways and other critical infrastructure, and farmers dumping manure, tyres, and hay on motorways in defiance of the green agenda.

Speaking to Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM in July, Dutch political commentator Eva Vlaardingerbroek said that her country was being used as a testing ground for the World Economic Forum’s Great Reset, saying that “all these policies are out of those institutions and they are being implemented in our country first, we are sort of the pilot country together with Canada for this agenda.”

Vlaardingerbroek went on to claim that the push from the government to seize farmland was, in fact, more a result of the migrant crisis than the alleged climate crisis, explaining that the government wants the land to house migrants. While not widespread as of yet, this has already occurred, with the province of Flevoland buying up land in Noordoostpolder to build an asylum processing centre on the site of a former farm.",EN,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Controversy about green technologies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives', 'CC: Controversy about green technologies: Renewable energy is unreliable', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",wef align dutch gov threaten forcibly sieze farm emit nitrogen world economic forum align netherlands government vow forcibly seize farm deem disrespect wef green agenda dutch farmer organization vow launch protest netherlands response advice government mediator demand seizure relocation farming firm seizure farm deem heavy nitrogen emitter dutch government come week bill gates catch admit climate change agenda scam new world order newly surface video boast term clean energy screw people mind accord gate speak audience inner circle wind solar battery technology renewable energy source fashionable capable solve climate change breitbart report farmer defence force leader mark van den oever announce week dutch farmer street government express intention adopt plan present deputy prime minister johan remke meet nitrogen standard demand european union remke serve chief mediator farmer organization government ongoing dispute nitrogen emission lay plan week farm locate close protect environment forcibly relocate scheme government seize farm emit nitrogen response plan van den oever say scheme completely wrong farmer nation old fashioned gas count reference widespread tractor protest farmer summer farmers defence force leader say minister ignore concern farmer globalist government prime mnister mark rutte impose far business plan relocate farm draw particular ire organisation spokesman sieta van keimpema describe measure red line farmer defend proposal remke say week result european union green agenda netherlands lock legally impossible issue permit house farm road write heavy heart way say add don expect agricultural sector happy report early year prime minister mark rutte announce intention cut nitrogen emission livestock farm half year order satisfy goal lay european union natura scheme require eu member states remove industry farming area deem ecological importance government assert meet eu goal farm reduce emission cent cent livestock farm shut permanently follow announcement scheme thousand farmer stage protest country tractor block highway critical infrastructure farmer dump manure tyre hay motorway defiance green agenda speak breitbart news daily siriusxm july dutch political commentator eva vlaardingerbroek say country testing ground world economic forum great reset say policy institution implement country sort pilot country canada agenda vlaardingerbroek go claim push government seize farmland fact result migrant crisis allege climate crisis explain government want land house migrant widespread occur province flevoland buy land noordoostpolder build asylum processing centre site farm

 The Ukraine War, How the British Derailed Peace

BATTLEFORWORLD.COM | November 25, 2023: Ex-Pentagon analyst revealed that the West refused to support the Ukraine-Russia peace talks and is now seeking a way out.

The leader of the Servant of the People faction in the Ukrainian parliament, Davyd Arakhamia, disclosed that the March 2022 Russian-Ukrainian peace talks was a no go because then UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson brought the negotiations to zero, to have Ukraine continue the conflict. And to pressure the Kiev regime, that was when the “Bucha massacre” appeared at the appropriate time to derailed the peace talks that was ongoing in Turkey.

The Bucha massacre was later debunked by Russia as a hoax, but the damage was already done to smear Russia on the world stage, to which the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson continued along pushing the war stroking the conflict as various countries kept on supplying all sorts of weapons.

According to Arakhamia, the Russians were willing to end the conflict if Ukraine was to agree to neutrality and provide guarantees to not join NATO. Arakhamia referenced an interview he gave to Ukrainian TV channel 1+1, saying: “When we returned from Istanbul, Boris Johnson came to Kiev and said: ‘We won’t sign anything with them at all, and let’s just fight’.”

 The leading general of the British army, Sir Patrick Sanders, just declared that Britain must prepare for a war with Russia. As we read in WIO News:

UK’s new top Army general General Sir Patrick Sanders has asked every soldier to prepare to fight against the Russian army in a potential World War III.

General Sanders, who took over from General Sir Mark Carleton Smith on Monday, told the British soldiers that they must prepare “to fight in Europe once again” as the conflict in Ukraine continues.

“There is now a burning imperative to forge an Army capable of fighting alongside our allies and defeating Russia in battle,” Sir Patrick said.

According to The Sun, the warning came in his first speech since he became Chief of the General Staff this month, taking overall control of the British Army.

“We are the generation that must prepare the Army to fight in Europe once again.”

“I am the first Chief of the General Staff since 1941 to take command of the Army in the shadow of a land war in Europe involving a continental power,” General Sanders added.

“Russia’s invasion of Ukraine underlines our core purpose — to protect the UK by being ready to fight and win wars on land.”


Columnist Mikhail Rostovsky finds it very strange that Sanders apparently believes that the war between Russia and NATO can be non-nuclear. The expert recalls that during the Cold War, an acute conflict never developed into a hot stage due to the doctrine of mutually assured destruction.

For some reason, Sanders believes that NATO will be able to fight Russia without the participation of nuclear forces.

 by Jonathan Cook, The Unz Review:

No one but the terminally naïve should be surprised that security services lie – and that they are all but certain to cover their tracks when they carry out operations that either violate domestic or international law or that would be near-universally rejected by their own populations.

Which is reason enough why anyone following the fallout from explosions last September that ripped holes in three of the four Nord Stream pipelines in the Baltic Sea supplying Russian gas to Europe should be wary of accepting anything Western agencies have to say on the matter.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In fact, the only thing that Western publics should trust is the consensus among “investigators” that the three simultaneous blasts deep underwater on the pipelines – a fourth charge apparently failed to detonate – were sabotage, not some freak coincidental accident.

Someone blew up the Nord Stream pipelines, creating an untold environmental catastrophe as the pipes leaked huge quantities of methane, a supremely active global-warming gas. It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.

If Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor. There is nothing Western states would like more than to intensify world fury against Moscow, especially in the context of NATO’s express efforts to “weaken” Russia through a proxy war waged in Ukraine.

But, after the claim made the rounds of front pages for a week or two, the story of Russia destroying its own pipelines was quietly shelved. That was partly because it seemed too difficult to maintain a narrative in which Moscow chose to destroy a critical part of its own energy infrastructure.

Not only did the explosions cause Russia great financial harm – the country’s gas and oil revenues regularly financed nearly half of its annual budget – but the blasts removed Moscow’s chief influence over Germany, which had been until then heavily dependent on Russian gas. The initial media story required the Western public to believe that President Vladimir Putin willingly shot himself in the foot, losing his only leverage over European resolve to impose economic sanctions on his country.

But even more than the complete lack of a Russian motive, Western states knew they would be unable to build a plausible forensic case against Moscow for the Nord Stream blasts.

Instead, with no chance to milk the explosions for propaganda value, official Western interest in explaining what had happened to the Nord Stream pipelines wilted, despite the enormity of the event. That was reflected for months in an almost complete absence of media coverage.

When the matter was raised, it was to argue that separate investigations by Sweden, Germany and Denmark were all drawing a blank. Sweden even refused to share any of its findings with Germany and Denmark, arguing that to do so would harm its “national security.”

No one, again including the Western media, raised an eyebrow or showed a flicker of interest in what might be really going on behind the scenes. Western states and their compliant corporate media seemed quite ready to settle for the conclusion that this was a mystery cocooned in an enigma.

Isolated and friendless

It might have stayed that way forever, except that in February, a journalist – one of the most acclaimed investigative reporters of the past half-century – produced an account that finally demystified the explosions. Drawing on at least one anonymous, highly placed informant, Seymour Hersh pointed the finger for the explosions directly at the US administration and President Joe Biden himself.",EN,"['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Distrust towards Media', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided']",medium don want know truth nord stream blast jonathan cook unz review terminally naïve surprised security service lie certain cover track carry operation violate domestic international law near universally reject population reason follow fallout explosion september rip hole nord stream pipeline baltic sea supply russian gas europe wary accept western agency matter truth live https://sgtreport.tv/ fact thing western public trust consensus investigator simultaneous blast deep underwater pipeline fourth charge apparently fail detonate sabotage freak coincidental accident blow nord stream pipeline create untold environmental catastrophe pipe leak huge quantity methane supremely active global warm gas act unrivaled industrial environmental terrorism washington able pin explosion russia initially hope vigor western state like intensify world fury moscow especially context nato express effort weaken russia proxy war wage ukraine claim round page week story russia destroy pipeline quietly shelve partly difficult maintain narrative moscow choose destroy critical energy infrastructure explosion cause russia great financial harm country gas oil revenue regularly finance nearly half annual budget blast remove moscow chief influence germany heavily dependent russian gas initial medium story require western public believe president vladimir putin willingly shoot foot lose leverage european resolve impose economic sanction country complete lack russian motive western state know unable build plausible forensic case moscow nord stream blast instead chance milk explosion propaganda value official western interest explain happen nord stream pipeline wilt despite enormity event reflect month complete absence medium coverage matter raise argue separate investigation sweden germany denmark draw blank sweden refuse share finding germany denmark argue harm national security include western medium raise eyebrow show flicker interest go scene western state compliant corporate medium ready settle conclusion mystery cocoon enigma isolated friendless stay way forever february journalist acclaimed investigative reporter past half century produce account finally demystify explosion draw anonymous highly place informant seymour hersh point finger explosion directly administration president joe biden

 The Federal Reserve’s credibility is in tatters.

It predicted low inflation through 2021 even as the money supply exploded and higher inflation followed. To catch up, it quickly raised interest rates, stressing many banks, and Fed examiners failed to act before depositors noticed that Silicon Valley Bank was insolvent.

The result was bank runs and panic. But instead of lowering inflation and preventing recession, many of the Fed’s 400 economists are busy fighting climate change. [emphasis, links added]

Examples of climate activism abound.

This year the Fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports on their climate vulnerability in a “pilot project” that is sure to expand and might lead to lending restrictions.

A query of the Fed’s listing of recent publications returns hundreds of research papers, press releases, and policy statements related to climate change. The San Francisco Fed hosted a conference on climate change in May, in which 27 Fed economists participated.

With all this effort, one might hope the Fed would produce high-quality research on climate change. But I took a close look at two Fed studies on the subject and found shockingly poor analysis.

These studies on the effect of temperature on U.S. and world economic growth are cited without a hint of skepticism and widely lavished with media attention. I’ve managed to debunk both.

In the September issue of Econ Journal Watch, I discredited a paper from the Richmond Fed claiming that warming reduces economic growth in the U.S.

I showed that the paper had serious problems with its statistical reasoning and robustness. My analysis concluded that the data used in the paper showed no meaningful relationship between temperatures and growth.

More recently I published a critique of a study from the Federal Reserve Board claiming that a year of above-normal temperatures in countries around the world makes economic contraction more likely.

The original study used sophisticated statistical techniques but failed to report that its primary finding was statistically insignificant. My request to the study’s author for computer code to reproduce the paper’s results went unanswered.

I managed to write the code from scratch and exactly replicate the results, allowing me to run additional tests that the author didn’t report.

The author’s primary result—that temperature has a bigger effect in bad than in good economic times—turned out to be statistically insignificant. Additional analysis showed that there is no reliable effect of temperature on growth at all.

There are two main reasons why the Fed study appeared at first to show a statistically significant effect of temperatures on economic growth. First, each country in the sample had equal weight in the analysis.

China had the same weight as St. Vincent though China’s population is 13,000 times as large. Equal weighting means that some small countries with unusual histories of economic growth greatly influenced the results.

The paper’s results disappeared when countries like Rwanda and Equatorial Guinea—which had economic catastrophes and bonanzas unrelated to climate change—were omitted.

Omitting similar countries representing less than 1% of the world’s gross domestic product was enough to eliminate the paper’s result. The complicated statistical techniques used in the Fed study magnified the influence of these unusual countries.

There’s a second reason why the Fed study appears to find that temperature affects growth: Many poor countries have warm climates.

A warm climate doesn’t preclude economic growth, as is demonstrated by Florida, Arizona, Taiwan, Singapore, and several Persian Gulf states. But the average poor country is warmer than the average rich country.

Debate continues as to whether this correlation is random or causal, but the hypothesis of the Fed paper is that year-to-year increases in temperature reduce annual economic growth.

The paper claims that its method controls for long-term differences in climate, but using simulated data I found that the Fed paper’s method can be fooled into finding an effect that doesn’t exist.

The only thing to learn from the Fed’s research is that climate propaganda is spreading fast, and when it comes to climate, academic economists are no more deserving of trust than are other supposed scientists and experts.

The Fed’s time would be better spent on more urgent matters, like improving its botched regulation of the banking system.

 Hypocrisy: COP28 set to break carbon emissions records amid surge in attendee turnout

Experts have raised concerns that COP28 might set a new record for carbon emissions due to the unprecedented number of participants flying into Dubai.

The event, scheduled from November 30 to December 12, anticipates around 400,000 visitors, including 97,000 individuals who have registered as official delegates and will have access to the ""Blue Zone"" reserved for accredited government representatives and corporate entities, the Daily Mail reports.

This figure marks a significant increase from the 49,704 delegates at COP27 in Egypt and 38,457 at the 2021 conference in Scotland. Since 2019, the attendance has nearly tripled. The previous conference in Glasgow was already a record-setter, generating about 102,500 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to the annual emissions of 8,000 British citizens.

With the substantial turnout expected in the UAE, there are concerns that COP28 might continue this trend of rising carbon footprints at climate conferences.

Richard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, commented to The Telegraph that this event is likely to have the highest carbon footprint so far.

Originally a modest event in the mid-1990s with about 5,000 attendees, the COP conference has grown significantly, now expecting around 80 times that number. This includes both the open Green Zone, where organizations can showcase their climate actions and the secure Blue Zone, designated for official delegates and negotiations.

However, this expansion raises concerns about the conference's own environmental impact. A significant portion of the emissions, as seen in Glasgow, comes from international flights. Additionally, the logistical needs for housing, security, and transportation for such a large number of participants add to the carbon footprint.

Amid these concerns, there was criticism when UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, along with other high-profile figures, chose to travel to the summit by private jet, with Downing Street defending the decision, emphasizing the importance of strong UK participation in the summit.

It also stated that the government's stance is not against flying but focuses on investing in new technologies like sustainable aviation fuel and carbon offsetting, asserting that it seeks to lead in climate action without imposing flight restrictions.

This year, Graham Stuart, the Tory MP and Minister of State for Climate, will be heading the UK delegation at COP28.

In November, Stuart emphasized the importance of gradually reducing and eventually eliminating the ""unabated"" use of fossil fuels in the UK, while also noting that there is ""nothing fundamentally wrong with oil and gas.""

The West is increasingly losing patience with supporting Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky in the war with Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that the West is “fed up” with the money pit that has become this war.

Plus, the U.S. has now gotten itself involved in another war between Israel and Palestine, which has the potential to advance to World War 3. Speaking at a meeting with Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Lavrov argued that “everyone is fed up” with Zelensky, the Russia 1 TV channel reported on Sunday.

According to the broadcaster, the diplomat quoted Romanian Senator Diana Sosoaca, who directed an angry tirade at the Ukrainian president ahead of his visit to Bucharest last week. We all know that this war is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., so there’s no way the rulers are going to stop financially backing Ukraine.

Sosoaca called on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to prevent Zelensky, whom she described as an “arrogant and unconscionable traitor, including to his own country,” from addressing the Romanian parliament. The politician further warned of “bad” consequences should she “catch” the Ukrainian president at the parliament building. “We are going to war for Zelensky’s grain! March out of our country, godless man! If you think we will sit idly by, you are wrong!” Sosoaca stated.

Stop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War

According to Romanian media, the Ukrainian leader’s planned speech to parliament was canceled during his visit last Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference alongside Johannis, Zelensky insisted that he had never intended to make an address.

The opinion of Kiev in Romania has been adversely affected by the recent inflow of cheap Ukrainian grain into the country, coupled with what some see as discriminatory treatment toward the Romanian ethnic minority in Ukraine. –RT

Speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings in Marrakech on Saturday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko admitted that Kiev is being forced to make “twice the effort right now to convince our partners to provide us with support compared to the last annual meetings [in spring].” Part of that is because the U.S. has found another war to support, and one involving religion will be easier to escalate.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII']",ukraine western military backer feed support ukraine war west increasingly lose patience support ukrainian president vladimir zelensky war russia russian foreign minister sergey lavrov claim west feed money pit war plus u.s get involve war israel palestine potential advance world war speak meeting russian presidential aide yury ushakov kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov lavrov argue feed zelensky russia tv channel report sunday accord broadcaster diplomat quote romanian senator diana sosoaca direct angry tirade ukrainian president ahead visit buchar week know war proxy war russia u.s way ruler go stop financially back ukraine sosoaca call romanian president klaus iohannis prevent zelensky describe arrogant unconscionable traitor include country address romanian parliament politician warn bad consequence catch ukrainian president parliament building go war zelensky grain march country godless man think sit idly wrong sosoaca state stop denial ukraine proxy war lead wide world war accord romanian medium ukrainian leader plan speech parliament cancel visit tuesday speak press conference alongside johannis zelensky insist intend address opinion kiev romania adversely affect recent inflow cheap ukrainian grain country couple discriminatory treatment romanian ethnic minority ukraine rt speak sideline international monetary fund imf world bank meeting marrakech saturday ukrainian finance minister sergey marchenko admit kiev force twice effort right convince partner provide support compare annual meeting spring u.s find war support involve religion easy escalate

Not afraid of western sanctions choking Russian crude: Hardeep Singh PuriAbout half of Russian oil is carried by ships registered in the EU and a price cap could cut access to these. Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, import of Russian oil has sharply increased, rising from under 1% of India's imports last year to about 20%. Russia became the top supplier to India in October.

India does not fear that the West's proposed price cap could constrain shipping and impede the flow of Russian oil, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Wednesday. ""I have no anxiety on that,"" Puri said in response to a query on whether he feared that the proposed price cap on Russian oil could leave fewer tankers available to carry oil from Russia. ""The market will deal with that,"" he said.

About half of Russian oil is carried by ships registered in the EU and a price cap could cut access to these.

Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, import of Russian oil has sharply increased, rising from under 1 per cent of India's imports last year to about 20 per cent. Russia became the top supplier to India in October.

The West initially pressed India and other countries to stop buying Russian oil but has now changed tactics as keeping Russian oil off the global market can push up already high prices. To reduce Moscow's energy revenue, the West now wants countries to purchase Russian oil below a cap that's yet to be finalised.

Puri said GAIL and Russia's Gazprom are continuing to discuss the issue of LNG supply disruption. Gazprom has a long-term supply pact with GAIL but hasn't supplied for months. ""That discussion is going on. It will be resolved. At least, my expectation is it will be resolved,"" Puri said.

 MSM Admits ""Magical Thinking"" Guided Its Reporting On Ukraine... Many Thousands Of Deaths Later

A very short while ago, any US politician or media pundit publicly calling for peace negotiations in Ukraine with Russia's Putin was branded 'pro-Kremlin' and somehow compromised. For example, mainstream media has sought to isolate and cancel thinkers like John Mearsheimer for his realism toward Moscow and the conflict, and urging immediate ceasefire which would require territorial concessions from Kiev. It was only in September that one prominent publication branded him ""the world's most hated thinker.""

But now, at a moment Ukraine's leadership itself has become more desperate while admitting its forces are facing almost insurmountable odds, the D.C. beltway consensus has clearly and drastically changed, and now it's apparently okay to admit the following...

The War Street Journal acknowledges that the narratives it’s been pushing for months — of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive, a possible palace coup in Moscow, a Russian economy in tatters — are “Magical Thinking.” In other words, their coverage has been a fraud. pic.twitter.com/ZxB25W61Kn— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) November 16, 2023

The WSJ piece actually calls for a longer-term strategy of confronting Russia, while also admitting that Washington's approach thus far has been based on ""magical thinking"".

Or else we might just call the establishment narrative to this point fraudulent:

What Western leaders conspicuously haven’t done is level with their publics about the enduring nature of the threat from an emboldened, revisionist Russia. They have indulged all too often in magical thinking—betting on sanctions, a successful Ukrainian counter-offensive or the transfer of new types of weapons to force the Kremlin to come to the negotiating table. Or they have hoped to see Putin overthrown in a palace coup.

Elsewhere in the article, the authors point out that contrary to how the Wagner rebellion was widely presented in Western press, the reality is that whole episode actually strengthened Putin:

As Russian President Vladimir Putin looks toward the second anniversary of his all-out assault on Ukraine, his self-confidence is hard to miss. A much-anticipated Ukrainian counter-offensive has not achieved the breakthrough that would give Kyiv a strong hand to negotiate. Tumult in the Middle East dominates the headlines, and bipartisan support for Ukraine in the U.S. has been upended by polarization and dysfunction in Congress...

Putin has reason to believe that time is on his side. At the front line, there are no indications that Russia is losing what has become a war of attrition. The Russian economy has been buffeted, but it is not in tatters. Putin’s hold on power was, paradoxically, strengthened following Yevgeny Prigozhin’s failed rebellion in June. Popular support for the war remains solid, and elite backing for Putin has not fractured.

The tragedy is that so many people from both sides died for a year for nothing— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 16, 2023

Of course, none of this has stopped Zelensky as well as his friends in US Congress from seeking to push through more billions in American taxpayer aid for Ukraine.

On a global level too, Moscow has made inroads and gotten closer with other well-armed powers who find themselves in Washington's crosshairs...

Zelensky has recently complained that ""Russia's goal"" to take the global focus away from the Ukraine war is working, particularly against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising tensions in the Middle East. But certainly for now, Ukraine has taken a far backseat among the list of current Biden administration priorities, it seems. Perhaps indeed there's less ""magical thinking"" these days.

 President Joe Biden's administration announced Wednesday revised pollution standards for cars and trucks meant to accelerate the US auto industry's shift to electric to mitigate climate change.

The rules set ambitious emission reductions for 2032 but are moderated somewhat compared with preliminary standards unveiled last April. Following carmaker criticism, the final rules give manufacturers greater flexibility and ease the benchmarks in the first three years.

Those shifts were criticized as a sop to corporations from at least one environmental group, even as the final rule won praise from other leading NGOs focused on climate change.

The final rules -- which were described by administration official as ""the strongest ever"" and would likely be undone if Republican Donald Trump defeats Biden in November -- still require a nearly 50 percent drop in fleet-wide emissions in 2032 compared with 2026 through increased sales of electric vehicles (EVs) and low-emission autos.

The rules, which dovetail with other key Biden programs to build more EV charging stations and manufacturing facilities and incentivize EV sales, establish the environment as a significant point of difference in the 2024 presidential election.

Trump has mocked climate change as a problem and cast the transition to EVs as a job-killer that will benefit China at the expense of American workers.

Biden argues that US auto builders need to take the lead in the expanding EV market.

""I brought together American automakers. I brought together American autoworkers,"" said Biden in a statement. ""Together, we've made historic progress.""

Alluding to his target set three years ago that 50 percent of new vehicles in 2030 would be EVs, Biden predicted we'll meet my goal for 2030 and race forward in the years ahead.""

- Industry given more time -

EVs accounted for 7.6 percent in 2023 sales, up from 5.9 percent in 2022, according to Cox Automotive.

The original proposal had envisioned the EV share surging to as much as 67 percent of new vehicle sales by 2032.

Carmakers, which are midway through sweeping, multi-billion-dollar investments to build more EV capacity, criticized the initial standards as overly-stringent. They cited the limited state of charging capacity in the United States that has dampened consumer demand, as well as difficulties in supply of metals and other raw materials for EV batteries.

Following input from the auto industry, organized labor and auto dealerships, Biden administration officials decided to allow manufacturers a ""variety of pathways"" to reaching the standard, a senior Biden administration official said Tuesday.

This path could include a mix of EVs, conventional but more fuel-efficient engines, and plug-in hybrid vehicles, which have seen a rise in demand of late.

Biden administration officials opted to soften year-to-year emissions improvements in the 2027-2030 period, while maintaining the same target in 2032.

Moderating the targets in these first three years ""was the right call,"" said John Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a Washington lobby representing carmakers.

""These adjusted EV targets -– still a stretch goal –- should give the market and supply chains a chance to catch up,"" said Bozzella, adding that the extra time will allow more EV charging stations to come on-line.

- Too many 'loopholes'? -

The final standards set a fleet-wide target of 85 grams of carbon dioxide in 2032, down from 170 in 2027, according to an administration fact sheet.

Wednesday's initiative won praise from leading environmental groups including the Sierra Club and NRDC, which said the new rules ""take us in the right direction,"" according to a statement from NRDC chief Manish Bapna.

But Dan Becker, director of the climate transport campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, slammed the adjusted rules as ""significantly weaker.""

""The EPA caved to pressure from Big Auto, Big Oil and car dealers and riddled the plan with loopholes big enough to drive a Ford F150 through,"" Becker said.

""The weaker rule means cars and pickups spew more pollution, oil companies keep socking consumers at the pump, and automakers keep wielding well-practiced delay tactics.""",EN,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy']",biden unveil strict auto standard speed ev shift president joe biden administration announce wednesday revise pollution standard car truck mean accelerate auto industry shift electric mitigate climate change rule set ambitious emission reduction moderate somewhat compare preliminary standard unveil april follow carmaker criticism final rule manufacturer great flexibility ease benchmark year shift criticize sop corporation environmental group final rule win praise lead ngo focus climate change final rule describe administration official strong likely undo republican donald trump defeat biden november require nearly percent drop fleet wide emission compare increase sale electric vehicle evs low emission auto rule dovetail key biden program build ev charge station manufacturing facility incentivize ev sale establish environment significant point difference presidential election trump mock climate change problem cast transition evs job killer benefit china expense american worker biden argue auto builder need lead expand ev market bring american automaker bring american autoworker say biden statement historic progress allude target set year ago percent new vehicle evs biden predict meet goal race forward year ahead industry give time evs account percent sale percent accord cox automotive original proposal envision ev share surge percent new vehicle sale carmaker midway sweeping multi billion dollar investment build ev capacity criticize initial standard overly stringent cite limited state charge capacity united states dampen consumer demand difficulty supply metal raw material ev battery follow input auto industry organize labor auto dealership biden administration official decide allow manufacturer variety pathway reach standard senior biden administration official say tuesday path include mix evs conventional fuel efficient engine plug hybrid vehicle see rise demand late biden administration official opt soften year year emission improvement period maintain target moderate target year right say john bozzella president alliance automotive innovation washington lobby represent carmaker adjust ev target stretch goal market supply chain chance catch say bozzella add extra time allow ev charge station come line loophole final standard set fleet wide target gram carbon dioxide accord administration fact sheet wednesday initiative win praise lead environmental group include sierra club nrdc say new rule right direction accord statement nrdc chief manish bapna dan becker director climate transport campaign center biological diversity slam adjust rule significantly weak epa cave pressure big auto big oil car dealer riddle plan loophole big drive ford becker say weak rule mean car pickup spew pollution oil company sock consumer pump automaker wield practice delay tactic

 Letters to the Editor: Offshore wind can be California’s next Gold Rush

To the editor: Just as the Pacific was critical in transporting miners in the rush for gold and has been key to our state’s and our nation’s epic transoceanic commerce, it can now usher in our next Gold Rush in the form of offshore wind power.

Kudos to Michelle Solomon and Taylor McNair for reminding readers that this form of clean, renewable energy blowing along our coast needs only to be harnessed with floating wind turbines and transmitted via infrastructure to our population centers, facilitated by Inflation Reduction Act financial incentives.

The technology is available, the seed money to pay for the launch of this promising enterprise exists and the need for offshore wind energy could not be greater as the climate crisis ravages much of the world.

Gov. Newsom, this is your summons to even bolder climate leadership.

Ginger Osborne, Laguna Beach

..

To the editor: California stands to benefit from cleaner air, good-paying jobs and reliable energy with offshore wind technology. But policymakers need to pass legislation that locks in investment and resources for offshore wind to ultimately succeed in our state.

California should start by ensuring a market exists for the clean power that offshore wind will create. To do that, the Legislature should pass AB 1373. This piece of legislation ensures central procurement for offshore wind, meaning the Public Utilities Commission will start requiring utilities and companies servicing Californians’ electrical needs to have a diverse portfolio of clean energy sources — including offshore wind.

Lawmakers need to kick-start offshore wind in California, and they can start by passing AB 1373.

Dan Jacobson, Elk Grove, Calif.

..

To the editor: I agree that California should become a leader in building and deploying floating wind turbines. And while we can help this “nascent” technology emerge, we shouldn’t wait for it to mature to deploy offshore wind.

There are many unsightly oil platforms not far off the coast, particularly in Huntington Beach and Long Beach. These are grounded. We should deploy grounded wind turbines at similar depths and distances.

EN_CC_200056.txt,Other,Other,"WATCH: Arrests Made as Global Climate Protesters Demand End to Fossil Fuels 

 Roads will be blocked, cities shut down, airports targeted, marches begun and chanting, lots of chanting, will combine Friday as climate protesters around the world rally to demand an immediate end to fossil fuel use.

That’s the plan, anyway, with the so-called Global Climate Strike 2023 destined to last through the weekend and end late Sunday.

AP reports the mass public action — driven by several mostly youth-led, local and global climate groups and organizations, including Greta Thunberg’s Fridays for Future movement — will take place in dozens of countries and in at least 50 cities worldwide for 72-hours.

WATCH: Greta Thunberg Calls for “Drastic Emissions Cuts” to “Fundamentally Change Our Society”

The protest demands include – but are not restricted to – “divesting from new and current fossil fuel projects, sharing the burden equally among society, investing in community-owned renewable energy projects, and paying reparations to communities affected by the climate crisis,” Euronews reports.

Organisers said their climate protest would call on governments to end subsidies for oil and gas immediately and to cancel any plans for expanding fossil fuel production.

Financial institutions of all types around world will also face protests and a call for them to end funding fossil fuel development.

In one strike in Quezon City in the Philippines, AP reports activists lay in front of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in protest, and held signs demanding fossil fuels — from coal to natural gas — be phased out.

Another major mass action is planned to take place Sunday in New York, to coincide with the city’s Climate Week and the U.N. climate summit.

Climate activists have organized similar worldwide strikes in recent years, where protesters from different nations join together on a single day.

The “climate strike” comes two months before this year’s United Nations COP28 climate summit, where more than 80 countries plan to push for a global agreement to phase out coal, oil and gas.

 On Christmas day, when Christians are celebrating the birth of their Saviour, King Charles III used his Christmas message to push the “climate change” narrative.

“Out of God’s Providence, we are blessed with much and it is incumbent on us to use this wisely. However, service to others is but one way of honouring the whole of creation, which after all is a manifestation of the divine. This is a belief shared by all religions,” Charles III said.

Then he slipped seamlessly into climate activism. “To care for this creation is a responsibility owned by people of all faiths and of none. We care for the Earth for the sake of our children’s children. During my lifetime I’ve been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home we all share.”

What has that message got to do with the birth of Jesus and Jesus’ message for the world? Is he conflating religions? Is he attempting to dilute or usurp the “Our Saviour is born” message? Or, perhaps, he is attempting to merge his own beliefs into another to create a universal belief system he thinks we should all follow.

Below, Jordan Schachtel has more to say on Charles III using the world stage for his activism.

On Monday, King Charles III, who we sometimes refer to as the “WEF King” – because he’s one of the world’s most prominent anti-humans – dedicated a significant chunk of the Royal Family’s annual Christmas broadcast to the climate narrative.

Charles began with a unifying, apolitical message about having compassion for others, along with a plethora of unifying slogans, before quickly turning heel and going full Klaus Schwab mode, under the guise of presenting a cause that is greater than ourselves.

“We care for the Earth for the sake of our children’s children,” said Charles, who earlier this month flew on his very spacious private aircraft to the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (“COP 28”).

“During my lifetime I have been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home which we all share,” said Charles, who has been serving as king since September 2022.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has admitted that “climate crisis” prophecies of doom are a hoax.

In a major U-turn, climate alarmist Gates backtracked and confessed that “global warming” does not have apocalyptic consequences.

Gates reportedly told a group of his fellow globalist green agenda advocates that the “climate doom” narrative has now become so exaggerated that the public now sees right through the charade.

The admission from Gates is a major shift for the billionaire who has been a leading proponent of the “climate emergency” narrative.

For years, Gates has been championing the “Net Zero” goals of the unelected bureaucratic and corporate elite.

The “Net Zero” targets, as dictated to global governments by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and United Nations (UN), seek to strip the public of their quality of life in order to eliminate so-called “carbon emissions” by 2050.

However, as Slay News has reported, analysts warn that meeting these unrealistic goals will cost the taxpaying public $75 trillion.

Even after spending $75T, the world will still likely fall far short of the targets by 2050 and the globalists behind the policies will be long gone.

In 2021, Gates previously warned of apocalyptic consequences if the world fails to achieve “zero net carbon emissions” by the year 2050.

He warned the then-host of “Fox News Sunday” Chris Wallace in February 2021:

“The migration that we saw out of Syria for their civil war, which was somewhat weather dependent, we’re going to have 10 times as much migration because the equatorial areas will become unlivable.

“We won’t be able to farm or go outside during the summer.

“Wildfires, even the farming productivity in the south of the U.S. – the droughts – will reduce productivity in the area dramatically.”

Gates went on to say that the loss of life would be greater than even the worst part of the coronavirus pandemic.

“The instability overall will be five times as many deaths at the peak of the pandemic and going up every year,” he said.

“If we wait 10 more years it’s not as bad as if we wait 20 or we wait 30, because the temperature just keeps going up,” he said.",EN,"['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Other', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies have negative impact on the economy']",bill gates admit climate crisis narrative hoax microsoft co founder bill gate admit climate crisis prophecy doom hoax major turn climate alarmist gate backtrack confess global warming apocalyptic consequence gate reportedly tell group fellow globalist green agenda advocate climate doom narrative exaggerated public see right charade admission gate major shift billionaire lead proponent climate emergency narrative year gate champion net zero goal unelected bureaucratic corporate elite net zero target dictate global government world economic forum wef united nations un seek strip public quality life order eliminate call carbon emission slay news report analyst warn meet unrealistic goal cost taxpaye public trillion spend world likely fall far short target globalist policy long go gate previously warn apocalyptic consequence world fail achieve zero net carbon emission year warn host fox news sunday chris wallace february migration see syria civil war somewhat weather dependent go time migration equatorial area unlivable win able farm outside summer wildfire farming productivity south u.s drought reduce productivity area dramatically gate go loss life great bad coronavirus pandemic instability overall time death peak pandemic go year say wait year bad wait wait temperature keep go say

 WALL Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich has had his latest appeal blocked by a judge in Moscow after he was locked up on bogus spy charges.

The 31-year-old American appeared in a glass-walled dock after being brought from the tough jail where he has been held since March.

He lodged an appeal against a Moscow court judge's earlier decision to extend his pretrial detention into late November.

But today, the judge refused to hear the case and instead sent it to a lower court because of ""procedural violations"".

Gershkovich bravely smiled from behind the defendant's glass cage in a yellow jumper and kept his hands in the pockets of his jeans.

US ambassador Lynne Tracy was present at the hearing.

The US journalist was arrested in March 29 on trumped up charges of ""espionage"", which Gershkovich, Washington and The WSJ vehemently deny.

Russian officials have not yet provided any public evidence to back up their allegations.

No date has been officially set for his trial, however Putin's spooks continue to extend his detention - which today reached 174 days.

He will now suffer behind bars in the notorious Lefortovo prison until at least November 30.

Most read in The Sun

The WSJ's Moscow correspondent's pretrial detention was originally supposed to expire on May 29 - but appeals for his release have been repeatedly denied.

This expiration was pushed back to August 30, and was then extended into late November.

He has failed in two previous appeals, in April and June.

Under Moscow's criminal law, the 31-year-old could face a pretrial extension of up to 12 months.

Putin's arrest of Evan has previously been branded internationally as a ""cowardly act"" as the despot desperately tries to escape accountability over his war in Ukraine.

His arrest marked an increasingly ferocious crackdown on media freedom in Russia.

It is the first time Russia has brought a spy case against an overseas journalist since the end of the Cold War, and he faces a jail term of up to 20 years if convicted.

His employers called the arrest ""a vicious affront to a free press"" that ""should spur outrage in all free people and governments throughout the world"".

“No reporter should ever be detained for simply doing their job,"" The Journal added.

Washington has repeatedly stated that charges against Gershkovich are bogus and baseless and has demanded his immediate release.

They have deplored his ""wrongful detention"" as a method of ""hostage diplomacy"" designed to give Russia leverage at the bargaining table at a time when relations between the two countries have plunged to their lowest point in more than 60 years.

US officials said in July that there was still no clear ""pathway"" to getting him home, despite high-level talks.

 The beginning of the special military operation went down in history for the lightning-fast march of the Russian Armed Forces to Kyiv. Russia eventually pulled its troops back from the capital of Ukraine. Sooner or later, however, the Russian forces will have to take Kyiv.

It will take the Russian forces more than just three days to take Kyiv. Interestingly, it was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the US Armed Forces, General Mark Milley, who voiced the ""Kyiv in three days” phrase a month before the start of the special operation.

According to him, if the Russian forces go on a full-scale invasion, Kyiv will fall in 72 hours.

Neither the Russian authorities nor the Russian military promised to ""take Kyiv in three days.”

Some believe, however, that this could be real. The Russian army had already approached Kyiv when the West and Ukraine began negotiations and convinced Moscow to ""withdraw troops” for the talks to be effective. As always, NATO and Ukraine did not keep their promises.

Since then, Kyiv has been keeping 120,000 Ukrainian troops in this direction in constant combat readiness. They did not even use any of those personnel for the defense of Avdiivka.

Ukraine is trying to play it safe — although it is clear that the Russian army is not going to take Kyiv without giving it a second thought.

Colonel Timur Syrtlanov, a special forces veteran, told Tsargrad publication that Russia would need to accomplish the following:

These are ""Putin four strikes,” by analogy with Stalin ""10 strikes.”

Russia has combat experience that it gained in Chechnya and Syria, and the Russian forces will be ""tormenting” the enemy by working in a targeted manner.

As for the operation in the very beginning of the armed conflict, the attempt to come to an agreement with the Ukrainian authorities was a big mistake, political scientist Dmitry Rodionov believes. There were expectations that Zelensky would flee on day two or day three за the special military operation.

The Russian forces should have taken not only Kyiv, but also Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. As a result, the expert believes, ""intelligence errors led to gestures of goodwill that no one appreciated.”

All illusions about the nature of the special military operation have also been dispelled as well. This is not just a regional problem, but a period of global redivision of the world.

The West will drag out the conflict for as long as possible because it is benefiting from it. Meanwhile, Russia is developing cooperation with many other countries bypassing sanctions and living its own life, but no one knows how long all this is going to last.

Ultimate goals are as follows:

""It's time for Russia to take advantage of this circumstance. It is too early to attack Kyiv directly, but it is possible and necessary to split this society from within,” experts conclude.

 Two men in Russia braved their lives and rescued a girl from a burning building. The footage of the rescue has gone viral and both the men are being praised for their bravery. The video was captured from a distance, that shows the girl being rescued by her neighbours.

According to REN TV, a fire broke out in an apartment on Dorozhnaya Street in Russia’s Moscow on 29 January. On an immediate call, the emergency services rushed to the spot and controlled the situation well, the local TV added.

The reason for the fire was a short circuit, local news media Izvestia reported.

Reports suggest that three people were injured in the fire and 12 others were rescued from the house. They were later examined by doctors for immediate medical care and treatment. The fire had almost completely engulfed the apartment on the ninth floor of the building.

In the video, thick black smoke can be seen rising out of the windows of the building. From one of those windows, a girl is trying to escape her apartment as two men from the apartment below come to help her.

The video becomes nail-biting when the two men stand on the ledge of their narrow window. They are also seen holding on to the frame of the window to support the girl. After struggling for several minutes, the girl tries to climb down to escape the fire. Meanwhile, the men are seen holding her legs and then her body carefully.

The 52-second video went viral on several Reddit subgroups where the footage of the miraculous rescue shocked viewers.


An eyewitness to the incident told 360 TV channel that the men, who saved the girl, were also injured in the process.

After the video went viral, the Ministry of Emergency Situations are looking out for the two men to thank them for their heroic act.

The startup examines solutions to decrease livestock emissions, with a focus on a dietary supplement for cattle with ""anti-methanogenic properties.""

Rumin8's dietary supplement is synthesized from bromoform, an active ingredient in red seaweed, that prevents the creation of methane. The anti-methanogenic compounds in bromoform can target and eradicate bacteria producing the gas, reportedly cutting down on methane emissions and conserving animals' energy.

According to the startup, early trials on cows fed with the supplement saw a more than 85 percent reduction in methane emissions. This amounts to two tons of greenhouse gases removed each year for every cow being fed. Identical technologies in other nations also indicate that feeding anti-methanogenic supplements could lead to cattle and sheep conserving more energy for food production.

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) developed a comparable version in 2022 that decreased methane production by up to 20 percent. The supplement also helped increase milk production in cows. ICAR used tannins and compounds found in legume plants for its dietary supplement.

The agricultural industry has been under fire for greenhouse gas emissions, specifically methane. According to a 2013 report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has 80 times the planet-warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years that it lingers in the atmosphere.

The globalist group also mentioned that methane accounts for around 30 percent of global warming that has happened since the Industrial Revolution. Agricultural methane released from livestock burps, farts and manure account for 32 percent of methane emissions.

Gates, who is a big fan of the latest technologies to fight climate change, has supported companies working on all types of solutions, including next-generation nuclear reactors and cutting-edge carbon capture designs. (Related: Why is Bill Gates buying up farmland across America?)

As reported in the statement, the recent funds will ""accelerate Rumin8's road to commercialization,"" as the firm plans out fresh international trials, branding projects and a pilot manufacturing plant.

""The demand for sustainable protein has never been more apparent, which is why BEV is keenly interested in reducing methane emissions from beef and dairy,"" Carmichael Roberts, co-lead at the corporation’s investment committee, said in the statement.

Gates' investment in Rumin8 signals his first Australian venture with Breakthrough Energy, but it is far from his first investment in climate tech-startups.

""We’re invested now in over 100 startups. This one here in Australia, Rumin8, I think it's the 103rd,"" Gates said during a recent interview in Sydney with Michael Fullilove, executive director of the Lowy Institute, an independent think tank. The billionaire added that around six percent of global planet-warming emissions come from cows.

""It’s great to have Australia engaged in climate. The world isn't going to trade with people who don't have serious climate commitments. Australia was a bit of an outlier until quite recently.""

Watch this video of Bill Gates explaining why cows need to be changed, given that they account for six percent of global emissions.

EN_UA_300038.txt,Other,Other,"‘People close to me have died’ – Usyk won’t use Ukraine’s war with Russia as motivation for Anthony Joshua rematch 

 OLEKSANDR USYK has denied Ukraine’s heartbreaking invasion can be used as positive motivation against Anthony Joshua.

The 35-year-old barely got to celebrate his September win over the Brit icon, at Tottenham’s stadium for the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight world titles, before his home was invaded by Russia.

The devout husband and father cut short a February trip to England - where he visited Stamford Bridge to watch Chelsea - to race back to Kyiv and take up arms.

The London 2012 Olympic gold medal winner and former undisputed cruiserweight king was pictured with a machine gun over his shoulder as he held the line against Vladimir Putin’s invaders.

And - as recently as March - Usyk and his team were still unsure if they could take part in the August 20 Saudi Arabia rematch, with the country still in such turmoil.

The defending champ received special dispensation and encouragement to escape the war and represent his proud nation on the grandest stage and help shine a light on their continued plight.

But - after Tuesday’s Jeddah press conference, where Usyk stared Joshua down in their tense face-off - he refused to use the humanitarian crisis to his advantage.

Usyk said: ""My friends, people close to me, have died in the war.

“When so many people are suffering I don't have any idea how it can influence anything positively.

""I was there for one month, I saw with my own eyes what happened there, rockets flying and fighter jets flying. It's horrible.""

Usyk was much more guarded on the stage where he and Joshua bumped fists for the first time in almost a year.

Hiding his ice-cold glare from everyone bar AJ under his bucket hat, the southpaw sensation did almost nothing to help sell the fight and everything to frighten his old foe.

He said: “I never make loud or bright speeches, I just work hard in my gym and training camp.

""That’s what I am going to do until the fight.

“And then I will enter the ring and make you happy with my boxing.”

 Kant's comments follow two back-to-back G20 ministerial meetings in India in the last three weeks overshadowed by the war, which entered its second year last month.

Russia's war in Ukraine has brought the world to a standstill when urgent action is needed to address growing global poverty, India's G20 summit negotiator Amitabh Kant said on Wednesday.

Kant's comments follow two back-to-back G20 ministerial meetings in India in the last three weeks overshadowed by the war, which entered its second year last month.

India, which holds the bloc's presidency this year, has sought to highlight the economic impact of the conflict as well as issues such as climate change and poorer countries' debt.

""Europe cannot bring growth, poverty, global debt, all developmental issues to a standstill across the world,"" Kant told reporters.

""Especially when the south is suffering, especially when 75 countries are suffering from global debt, especially when one-third of the world is in recession, especially when 200 million people have gone below poverty line. Can that one war bring the entire world to a standstill?""

""Nutrition has been impacted, health outcomes have been impacted, learning outcomes have been impacted, people have become stunted and wasted and we are just concerned with one Russia and Ukraine war,"" Kant said. ""The world needs to move on and Europe needs to find a solution to its challenges.""

Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said Europe must grow out of the mindset that its problems are the world's problems but the world's problems are not Europe's problems.

India has declined to blame Russia for the war and has sought a diplomatic solution while boosting its purchases of Russian oil.

Kant said it is ""premature"" to even talk about whether US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin would attend a summit of leaders of the bloc in New Delhi on Sept. 9-10.

The Kremlin said on Monday that it was not ruling out Putin attending the summit.

Putin has not travelled beyond the former Soviet Union since sending his armed forces into Ukraine in February last year, and missed November's G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.

The G20 includes the rich G7 nations as well as Russia, China, India, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia, among other countries.

 AN emotional David Beckham said he ""can't imagine what Ukrainians have gone through"" at a summit meeting hosted by Piers Morgan.

The footie ace and father-of-four, who has been a UNICEF Goodwill ambassador for 17 years, appeared at the summit via a video link.

Beckham, 47, told the audience: ""Since the war in Ukraine began, I’ve been following the situation and speaking with UNICEF staff on the ground.

""I cannot imagine what the Ukrainian people have gone through these past five months, but I do know through my experience with UNICEF that getting back to routines through education and learning is a great healer for many children.""

In his message of support for Ukraine, the sporting star said he is ""always moved"" by the ""amazing spirit and determination"" of parents and ""children who have survived terrible disasters and conflict"".

Wearing a blue shirt and cream jacket, Beckham said: ""I’m frustrated that once again children are going through terrible trauma and pain, seeing things that no child should have to see.""

The acclaimed winger went on to discuss how he understood that children need routine - something he said his children lacked during the Covid-19 lockdowns.

He added: ""As a father, I’ve seen how a break in a child’s routine like the lockdowns we experienced during the Covid pandemic can affect children, their mood, their development, even their health.

""Whilst the war isn’t over, it’s important that whatever possible, we give children a chance to recover, to play, to meet new friends, to be close to their families and to start to regain their childhoods.""

Describing how ""school is about learning and [...] much more than that"", the co-owner of Salford City said he was ""lucky to have teachers and coaches who guided and encouraged me to achieve so much more"".

""All children deserve that and Ukrainian children must be protected and kept safe,"" Beckham reminded the audience.

""That is our duty – all of us as parents, leaders, mentors, and guides. And by recreating that feeling of safety, children will start to learn again and to dream of their futures.""

It comes after Piers Morgan praised Ukrainian President Zelensky and the First Lady for their resilience over the war with Russia.

The TalkTV host arrived in Kyiv earlier today to join Olena Zelenska for a summit meeting to help shine a light on the toll of Russia's invasion.

Zelensky's wife chaired the international event - The Second Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen - which marks the 150th day of Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine.

Piers was quick to praise the Presidential couple as ""inspiring"" before saying that it was a ""great privilege"" to be welcomed in Kyiv.

He said: ""I wanted to say to the First Lady just how inspiring the world finds you and your husband. The way that you have rallied the people of Ukraine, is amazing to watch.

“I had the honour of being invited here and I couldn’t wait to come to Ukraine and see for myself the resilience of the people here. You are a remarkable people.

“I have never met any country that has this strength and resilience with the possible exception of my country in World War Two.

“And I think it’s an amazing thing to watch, so I think you should be incredibly proud not just of your leaders but of the people.""

 In response to EU's recent decision to ban Russian media outlets such as RIA Novosti news agency, Izvestia and Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspapers, the Russian authorities blocked 81 EU publications, including Politico, Spiegel, AFP and a number of others. Moscow promised to review the measure if the EU lifts the ban.

The Russian Foreign Ministry banned the broadcasting of 81 European media outlets in response to similar measures that the European Union earlier took against Russian media.

The most recent move will affect, in particular, Politico, Agence France-Presse (AFP), Der Spiegel (Germany), Yle (Finland), El País (Spain), EUobserver, LRT (Lithuania), the Estonian version of Delfi website and other media.

Moscow's measures come in response to the EU broadcast ban on RIA Novosti, Rossiyskaya Gazeta and Izvestia, as well as Voice of Europe for ""war propaganda.” Brussels found that the Russian government controls these media outlets and uses them to promote and support Russia's military operation in Ukraine, ""as well as to destabilise neighbouring countries.” The EU noted that the measure will not prevent media employees ""from carrying out activities in the EU, with the exception of broadcasting.”

EU's Russian media ban comes into force in the European Union on June 25.

""If restrictions on Russian media are lifted, the Russian side will also reconsider its decision in relation to the mentioned media operators,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Maria Zakharova, an official representative of the department, said on June 24 that Moscow developed responsive measures ""realizing that it was useless to hope for Brussels commitment to international legal obligations.”

Since the beginning of hostilities in Ukraine, the EU has banned broadcasting of a number of Russian media, including NTV/NTV Mir, Rossiya 1, REN TV, Channel One, RT and Sputnik. Certain EU countries, such as, for example, Latvia, banned the broadcasting of 80 Russian TV channels. YouTube channels of many Russian media outlets were also blocked. Pravda.Ru YouTube channel was blocked as well.

Khazarian Terrorist Group Executing Nuclear Terror Operation in Ukraine…
AGAIN!

“Looking back in history, it must be admitted that these lands are the ancient ancestral lands of the Jewish Khazaria, that is Israel, captured by Kiev’s Rus’ (the ancient state of Russia with the capital in Kiev) in the tenth century. The Slavs are temporary guests on these lands and are subject to eviction. We will return this territory, and build the Great Khazaria – the Jewish state –on these fertile lands the same way as, 50 years ago, we created Israel, squeezing the Palestinians out. Israelis will partially relocate here, and we will drive the Slavic cattle out far to the north, beyond Moscow. There will be a small Northern Territory, a reservation with a compact population — a reservation, like Indian reservations in America.”

— Quote from Menachem Mendel Schneerson, American Orthodox rabbi and foremost leader of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement

The preceding quote, uttered by the most revered and powerful leader of the modern Chabad Movement within Judaism, tells the whole story.

The Ukraine War was actually started by the Zio-Anglo-American Axis to fulfill the main prophecy implied by Schneerson’s series of apocalyptic statements.

With this critical understanding, it ought to be much easier to comprehend that the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster was stealthily executed as a nuclear terrorist attack … … … and by all the usual Khazarian suspects.
1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster:
An Apocalyptic Terrorist Act of Epic Proportions

The previous link contains Internet pathways to all of the conclusive scientific evidence necessary which proves that the Chernobyl nuclear disaster was carried out as a covert terror attack by the Western Powers against Russia.

For anyone who still has any doubt about this revised history, the following exposé clearly spells out the true purpose and perpetrators of that egregious crime against humanity committed at Russia’s Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1986.
Chernobyl was a terrorist attack.
Now, fast forward to 2022.

What the whole world is now witnessing in Ukraine today — in the fog of that meticulously engineered war — is yet another scheme to carry out a nuclear terror event in order to fulfill the odious predictions of rogue rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson.  It could even be posited that the Ukraine War was purposefully provoked to set the stage for a long-planned and rapidly evolving nuclear terror event.  As follows:

Every day that goes by, the Khazarian nuclear terrorist group gets closer and closer to deliberately triggering the greatest nuclear catastrophe of the Third Millennium at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, as a prelude to starting World War III.

There are obviously several objectives to be accomplished by triggering such a “Nuclear Armageddon”.  Not only do the Khazarian perpetrators intend to force the Ukrainians off  and far away from their ancestral lands, especially the Russian speakers, they also want to establish the “New Israel” there as articulated by Schneerson.

The lies to generate fear and justify dystopia are absolutely shocking 

 A top mosquito expert has blasted Professor Dame Jenny Harries’s claim that climate change will make dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases common in the U.K. within 20 years, branding it “entirely fictional” and “shameless”.

Professor Harries, who heads the U.K. Health Security Agency (UKHSA), recently said that rising temperatures will make such diseases common in the U.K. by 2040 because the Asian Tiger Mosquito – which can transmit dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever and other viral diseases – will become established throughout Britain. Dengue will become endemic in London, she claimed.

But Professor Paul Reiter, retired Professor of Insects and Infectious Diseases at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and a leading expert in mosquito-borne diseases, has ridiculed her claims. He told Net Zero Watch:

The natural range of the Tiger mosquito, an Asian species, extends from the tropics to regions where mean January temperatures are around –10°C. Northern strains are able to survive because in late summer, as days grow shorter, the eggs they lay are dormant and remain unhatched until spring arrives.

It is true that since the late 1970s, there has been rapid global spread of the Tiger mosquito to the United States, Latin America, Europe and across Africa, probably mainly via the global trade in used tyres. Professor Reiter says that it is beyond doubt that this has nothing at all to do with temperature.

Professor Reiter has also lambasted fearmongering about the return of malaria, noting that this was once a major cause of death in many parts of England, even during the Little Ice Age from the 1300s to the 1800s, and its disappearance was, once again, nothing to do with temperature:

Shakespeare mentions malaria – “the ague” – 13 times, so it was clearly once common here. The disease began to decline – for a multitude of reasons – in the mid-19th century, despite the upward trend in global temperatures.

Net Zero Watch Director Andrew Montford said:

This is not the first time we have seen the Civil Service misleading the public in this way. Science is being misused to generate fear and to ‘nudge’ us in a desired direction. This kind of shameful disinformation brings the Civil Service into disrepute.

But it seems our public officials won’t miss an opportunity to bang the climate alarmist drum as they attempt to cajole and coerce the public into accepting radical cuts in living standards to ward off threats based solely on the perennially wrong outputs of biased computer models.

 FACT CHECK: Did John Kerry’s Daughter Say Billions Must Die For ‘New World Order’?

A post shared on Facebook claims Vanessa Kerry, daughter of former U.S. climate envoy John Kerry, said billions of humans must die for the “New World Order.”

Verdict: False

There is no evidence Kerry said this. It originates from a site that is a regular source of misinformation and has been debunked by Check Your Fact several times in the past.

Fact Check:

Some studies have suggested that climate change may be causing more turbulence on airplanes, according to Washington Post. In spite of this, airlines are getting better at anticipating rough skies, meaning there may not be much change in the overall rate of turbulence, the outlet reported.

A Facebook post suggests Kerry has said people must die for the “New World Order.” The post shows an image of Kerry smiling above the text, “John Kerry’s Daughter Says BILLIONS of Humans Must Die for the ‘New World Order.'”

“So now we know… they are KILLING us with chemicals, shots, food is poisoned.. ENOUGH!!!” the caption reads. (RELATED: No, John Kerry Has Not Called For Depopulation As A Part Of The United Nations’ Agenda 2030)

The claim is baseless, however. There are no credible news reports to suggest Kerry said this. Likewise, the alleged statement could not be found on any of Kerry’s social media accounts.

The image’s text matches a headline from The People’s Voice.

 A Monday Politico article claims Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump could secretly care about global warming based on an application to build a seawall to protect a golf resort.

In reality, this only shows Trump uses global warming alarmism to benefit his business.

A permit application for the wall by Trump International Golf Links Ireland which was reviewed by Politico explicitly cites global warming and erosion due to rising sea levels as a justification to build the structure. However, the application was prepared by an Irish environmental consulting group, not Trump’s business. The application clearly uses global warming to add urgency to a permit application to build a seawall which will protect his property from erosion and storms.

Trump’s previous attempts to build the seawall failed to win special approval from Ireland’s national government, so his business resubmitted the application citing global warming as the motivating factor. The seawall would consist of 200,000 tons of rock distributed along two miles of beach in front of Trump’s property.

“The zoning application raises further questions about how the billionaire developer would confront a risk he has publicly minimized but that has been identified as a defining challenge of this era by world leaders, global industry and the American military,” claims Politico. “His public disavowal of climate science at the same time he moves to secure his own holdings against the effects of climate change also illustrates the conflict between his political rhetoric and the realities of running a business with seaside assets in the 21st century.”

The real estate mogul has a long history of skepticism about global warming. Trump has taken to Twitter to call global warming a “hoax,” “mythical,” a “con job,” “nonexistent,” and “bullshit.” Trump also has a long history of questioning the benefits of politically popular green power in favor of conventional energy sources. He views policies created to fight global warming as hurting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness with China. Trump has also vowed to “at a minimum” renegotiate the United Nation’s December’s Paris climate deal.

Trump has also expressed extreme skepticism of wind and solar power which environmentalists claim are the best way to prevent global warming.

“I will say wind is a problem because it’s very expensive to build the towers, very, very expensive, and as you know when you have 40-dollar oil, it’s not economics, so they’re going to have to do a subsidy, otherwise wind isn’t going to work,” Trump said when pointing out problems with wind energy to The Washington Post.

Trump even sued to prevent the construction of a new wind farm in Scotland which would have spoiled the view of a luxury golf resort he owns. Trump publicly stated he would stop development of the resort if the wind farm project went ahead.

Trump has vehemently opposed wind power on Twitter, saying “nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy–a disaster for taxpayers” and asking “How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.”

Trump’s skepticism of solar power is equally well documented, as he said in a 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren that solar panels are “economically, they’re not good. It’s a very, very poor form of energy. Solar, as you know, hasn’t caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years — it’s a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is, the technology is not there yet.”

Trump’s stance on solar is markedly different from that of his likely Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who plans to build “half a billion” solar panels. One of Clinton’s biggest financial backers, hedge fund billionaire Warren Buffett, has invested billions into building just that type of solar panel.

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

The World Economic Forum (WEF) which represents the Western financial elites, played a key role in the launching of the March 11, 2020 corona lockdown, which was conducive to a Worldwide process of economic and social chaos. It also played a key role in the launching of the Covid-19 vaccine. in November 2020.

And now they are “promising” us a crisis which is “Much Worse than Covid”.

Over the last three years the deliberate triggering of chaos has become part of a broad and complex agenda: the war in Ukraine, the hike in energy prices, the triggering of bankruptcies, the collapse of economic activity, widespread poverty, famine and despair.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

In recent developments, Washington has endorsed Israel’s genocide directed against the People of Palestine, coupled with an unfolding US-NATO-Israel military agenda against the broader Middle East.

Cyber-Attacks

The article below focusses on the imminent dangers of Cyber Warfare, which have already been announced by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

In 2021, the WEF conducted a simulation of Cyber Attacks involving a scenario of Paralysis of the Power Supply, Communications, Transportation, The Internet.

Klaus Schwab intimated in no uncertain terms based on “a simulated scenario” that a cyber-attack:

“Could bring a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole …

The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyberattack.” (emphasis added)

What does Schwab have up his sleeve?

A “Cyber Terrorist Attack” conducive to unprecedented disruptions? Is this something that we should take seriously?

A renewed fear campaign, a warning of an impending danger? In the words of Jeremy Jurgens, who is the WEF’s Managing Director:

“I believe that there will be another crisis. It will be more significant. It will be faster than what we’ve seen with COVID. The impact will be greater, and as a result the economic and social implications will be even more significant.” (emphasis added)

The 2021 WEF cyber polygon simulation scenario had an obvious “contradictory” geopolitical slant:

The event was chaired by Russia’s Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, numerous Russian financial institutions, media and communications entities had been invited by the WEF.

Forty-eight countries participated in the Event, there were 41 partners of which 10 were from Russia and Kazakhstan: these included News Agency TASS, NTV, Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank and a leading global financial institution, the Mail.ru Group, Russia’s largest internet provider, MTS, Russia’s leading telecommunications group, the State Legal Department of the Omsk Region, Siberia. Powerful banking financial institutions from Kazakstan. Among others.

See also the assumptions of the Training Program, which are predicated on terrorist cyber hackers.

Amply documented, the World Economic Forum (WEF) has been instrumental in endorsing US-NATO’s military agenda in regards to Ukraine.

Was this July 2021 Cyber Polygon event (which occurred less than 8 months prior to the outset of the Ukraine War) intent upon creating political divisions within the Russian Federation by establishing partnerships with a number of powerful Russian media, communications, banking and financial institutions, etc.

Not a single representative from the People’s Republic of China. Was the Cyber Polygon Simulation (July 2021) intended to foster confrontation between China and Russia? Are Cyber attacks contemplated as part of a Global Military agenda?

The Process of “All-Digitization”

In November 2023, as documented in an article by Peter Koenig, the Financial Elites passed from the “study of scenarios” to “implementation”. They entrusted the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) “as the flag-carrier … for the deadly onslaught of All-Digitization.”",EN,['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups'],['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other'],wef cyber attack scenario crisis bad covid paralysis power supply communication transportation prof michel chossudovsky global research world economic forum wef represent western financial elite play key role launching march corona lockdown conducive worldwide process economic social chaos play key role launching covid- vaccine november promise crisis bad covid year deliberate triggering chaos broad complex agenda war ukraine hike energy price trigger bankruptcy collapse economic activity widespread poverty famine despair truth live https://sgtreport.tv/ recent development washington endorse israel genocide direct people palestine couple unfold nato israel military agenda broad middle east cyber attack article focusse imminent danger cyber warfare announce world economic forum wef wef conduct simulation cyber attack involve scenario paralysis power supply communication transportation internet klaus schwab intimate uncertain term base simulated scenario cyber attack bring complete halt power supply transportation hospital service society covid- crisis see respect small disturbance comparison major cyberattack emphasis add schwab sleeve cyber terrorist attack conducive unprecedented disruption seriously renew fear campaign warning impending danger word jeremy jurgens wef managing director believe crisis significant fast ve see covid impact great result economic social implication significant emphasis add wef cyber polygon simulation scenario obvious contradictory geopolitical slant event chair russia prime minister mikhail mishustin numerous russian financial institution medium communication entity invite wef country participate event partner russia kazakhstan include news agency tass ntv sberbank russia large bank lead global financial institution mail.ru group russia large internet provider mts russia lead telecommunication group state legal department omsk region siberia powerful banking financial institution kazakstan assumption training program predicate terrorist cyber hacker amply document world economic forum wef instrumental endorse nato military agenda regard ukraine july cyber polygon event occur month prior outset ukraine war intent create political division russian federation establish partnership number powerful russian medium communication banking financial institution etc single representative people republic china cyber polygon simulation july intend foster confrontation china russia cyber attack contemplate global military agenda process digitization november document article peter koenig financial elite pass study scenario implementation entrust united nations conference trade development unctad flag carrier deadly onslaught digitization

 BAKU, Azerbaijan, April 23. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country taking part in solving global environmental problems, editor of London-based Energy Intelligence Michael Ritchie told Trend.

""During COP29 in November, all eyes will be on Azerbaijan. The event will be attended by tens of thousands of journalists, participants, and delegates. There will also be questions about why the oil and gas producer is taking part in the climate talks. But COP29 follows immediately after this conference in the United Arab Emirates, also a major oil and gas producer. The UK, where I come from, is also an oil and gas producer and has also hosted this conference. COP29 is an opportunity for Azerbaijan to announce itself to the world as a country that is taking part in solving global environmental problems,"" Ritchie said.

According to him, COP29 is crucial to achieve financial goals and to obtain additional funds, possibly from developed countries, for climate finance. It will also lay the groundwork for the next COP30 in Brazil.

To note, Azerbaijan will host the 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29) in November this year. The decision was made at the plenary meeting of COP28 held in Dubai on December 11 last year. Within two weeks, Baku, having become the center of the world, will host about 70,000–80,000 foreign guests.

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is an agreement signed at the Rio Earth Summit in June 1992 to prevent dangerous human interference in the climate system. The acronym COP (Conference of Parties) stands for Conference of Parties, which is the highest legislative body overseeing the implementation of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.

The parties to the convention are 198 countries. Unless the parties have decided otherwise, COP is held annually. The first COP event was held in March 1995 in Germany's Berlin, and its secretariat is located in Bonn.

 NUSA DUA – The European Council president urged global powers Tuesday to intensify pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine, including Moscow's biggest supporter, China, saying that this week's meeting of the world's largest economies was crucial to stopping Moscow's push ""to use food and energy as weapons.”

Charles Michel, speaking to reporters on the first day of the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, said the nine-month war waged by Russia, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, has disrupted lives across the world, as food and energy prices surge and economies stagnate.

“Russia’s war impacts us all, no matter where we live, from Europe to Africa or the Middle East, and the single best way to end the acute crisis in food and energy is for Russia to end this senseless war and to respect the U.N. charter,” Michel said. “The Kremlin has decided to weaponize food, driving up hunger, poverty and instability.”

Europe, Michel said, is working to help Ukraine, a big food exporter before the war, increase its shipments, and is also trying to address disruptions in fertilizer supplies and rising prices. EU sanctions against Russia, he said, don’t target agricultural products, even though Russia has imposed restrictions on its own food and fertilizer products.

“This is not a battle (of) Russia against the Western part of the world. It’s a battle for the U.N. charter. It’s a battle for the international law. It's a battle for the idea that this is not acceptable to try to change by force internationally recognized borders.”

Michel said he had no plans to meet with the most senior Russian present in Bali, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

China, the world's second biggest economy, has largely refrained from public criticism of Russia’s war, although Beijing has avoided direct support of the Russians, such as supplying arms. Michel avoided direct criticism of China when asked if Beijing has shown any signs of changing its steadfast support of Russia in recent days.

Instead, he said that the G-20 meeting Tuesday and Wednesday was important to convince all nations present “to put more pressure on Russia.""

After a meeting Monday between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, Biden said the two leaders discussed Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and “reaffirmed our shared belief” that the use or even the threat of nuclear weapons is “totally unacceptable” — a reference to Moscow’s thinly veiled threats to use atomic weapons as its invasion of Ukraine has faltered.

Michel said that Europe must make sure that it creates a different economic and political relationship with China than the one it did with Russia.

“We don't want to make the same mistakes maybe we make with Russia on fossil fuels,” which Europe was very dependent on, “with China, (where) we don't want to be too dependent for the innovative technology that we need today and that we need more in the future. That's why it's important to rebalance the relationship,” Michel said.",EN,['URW: Overpraising the West'],['URW: Overpraising the West: The West belongs in the right side of history'],european leader call world china pressure russia nusa dua european council president urge global power tuesday intensify pressure russia war ukraine include moscow big supporter china say week meeting world large economy crucial stop moscow push use food energy weapon charles michel speak reporter day group meeting bali say month war wage russia permanent member u.n security council disrupt life world food energy price surge economy stagnate recommend video russia war impact matter live europe africa middle east single good way end acute crisis food energy russia end senseless war respect u.n charter michel say kremlin decide weaponize food drive hunger poverty instability europe michel say work help ukraine big food exporter war increase shipment try address disruption fertilizer supply rise price eu sanction russia say don target agricultural product russia impose restriction food fertilizer product battle russia western world battle u.n charter battle international law battle idea acceptable try change force internationally recognize border michel say plan meet senior russian present bali foreign minister sergey lavrov china world second big economy largely refrain public criticism russia war beijing avoid direct support russians supply arm michel avoid direct criticism china ask beijing show sign change steadfast support russia recent day instead say g- meeting tuesday wednesday important convince nation present pressure russia meeting monday president joe biden chinese president xi jinping biden say leader discuss russia aggression ukraine reaffirm share belief use threat nuclear weapon totally unacceptable reference moscow thinly veil threat use atomic weapon invasion ukraine falter michel say europe sure create different economic political relationship china russia want mistake maybe russia fossil fuel europe dependent china want dependent innovative technology need today need future important rebalance relationship michel say

 DeSantis brags his climate change plan is scrap Biden’s

Florida Republican Governor Ron DeSantis says if elected president his plan to address climate change will be to throw out President Joe Biden’s Green New Deal.

Last week on Monday planet Earth suffered the hottest day on record, a record that it broke on Tuesday.

Fox News Business’ Stuart Varney, who has attacked climate change activists as “juvenile” and declared it is “ridiculous” that “the western world is obsessed with climate change,” on Monday asked DeSantis if he has a plan to address the climate crisis.

“The headlines are just full of stories about wildfires smoke, extraordinary temperatures in the southwest and the Southeast to some degree. Do you have a climate plan?” Varney asked.

“It’s going to be to rip up Joe Biden’s Green New Deal,” DeSantis bragged. “I think at the end of the day, we need to embrace American domestic energy. This could be a huge source of national security, economic vitality can build our industrial base in Florida.”

DeSantis’ claim echoes Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy‘s, who last Thursday said God has blessed America with large natural gas resources, and the United States should use them to make two of the world’s largest countries and largest economies, China and India, “dependent on American natural gas.” He suggested doing so would “make us economically stronger but geopolitically the world safer,” while falsely claiming it would make the world “environmentally sound.”

The Florida governor bragged to Varney about Florida’s reduction in emissions, which happened, he admitted, through “market forces.”

“We’ve actually had a huge reduction in emissions but it was done through innovation,” DeSantis said. “It was done through market forces, not command and control. So we’ll go about that in a much different direction than, than Joe Biden, I think ultimately, Biden’s policies and Bidenomics is really about making the average person poor and reducing their standard of living. That is not the way you go about it.”

Last year, a Tampa Bay Times opinion piece noted, “2018, the last year for which [emissions] data is available, Florida utilities had decreased emissions by 19%, the research shows, while tailpipe emissions grew 12%.”

DeSantis was sworn into office in 2019.

Also last year, the Miami Herald warned Florida was not addressing the causes of climate change.

“The last time the Legislature addressed the root cause of climate change — greenhouse gas emissions — it was in a law that effectively blocked cities from cutting emissions,” the paper reported.

 Russia – Exposure of ‘dirty bomb’ plans caused panic in Kiev

“Many signs” show Ukraine is winding down its program amid Moscow’s revelations, a senior diplomat claimed

Kiev might be shelving its alleged ‘dirty bomb’ program after Russia exposed it, Moscow’s deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyansky, claimed on Tuesday. He added that Ukraine may well have time to do this before the upcoming nuclear inspection.

Over the last few days, Russian officials, including Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, have been accusing Kiev of preparing a false-flag attack with the use of a ‘dirty bomb’, a device combining conventional explosives with radioactive material. Ukraine has categorically denied Moscow’s claims.

“If you read the Ukrainian Telegram channels, you would see that there is a lot of fuss in the Ukrainian ruling circles now because of the campaign that we have started to launch, and there are many signs that they are trying to sort of wind down this program,” Polyansky said, as quoted by RIA Novosti.

In his opinion, Ukraine has enough time to scale back the ‘dirty bomb’ plans before the upcoming visit of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors.

“They can come, but I am telling you that a ‘dirty bomb’ is not a very complex device,”Polyansky explained, adding that there is no guarantee that Kiev will not resume its alleged activity after the inspectors depart.

At the same time, the official claimed that the danger of Kiev using a ‘dirty bomb’ remains “very high,” and that Ukraine “has the opportunity” and “has every reason to use it.”

Earlier on Tuesday, in a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Russian mission’s head, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow would consider the use of a ‘dirty bomb’ by Ukraine “an act of nuclear terrorism.”

Meanwhile, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitry Kuleba earlier called the Russian allegations “as absurd as they are dangerous.” He also noted that “Russians often accuse others of what they plan themselves.”

On Tuesday, the minister revealed that Ukraine had invited IAEA inspectors to come and to “prove that Ukraine has neither any dirty bombs nor plans to develop them.”

“Good cooperation with IAEA and partners allows us to foil Russia’s ‘dirty bomb’ disinfo campaign,” Kuleba said.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric, commenting on the matter, said that “all parties should avoid any actions that could lead to miscalculation and escalation of what’s already a devastating conflict.”

Meanwhile, the Pentagon claimed that Russia’s allegations against Ukraine were “transparently false.” NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg said that the allies “reject the allegation” and believe that Russia “must not use it as a pretext” for further escalation.

EN_CC_200211.txt,Other,Other,"Review: ‘The Out-Laws’ is a criminal waste of time 

 LONDON: A producer’s credit for Adam Sandler is not quite the badge of honor it used to be, and nowhere is that more evident than in new Netflix comedy “The Out-Laws.”

This ostensibly funny heist movie stars Adam DeVine as bank manager Owen Browning, a bumbling (yet, the film insists, lovable) dork who suspects that his soon-to-be in-laws might have robbed his bank and then attempted to frame him.

Said in-laws are Billy (Pierce Brosnan) and Lilly (Ellen Barkin), a pair of suave, sophisticated rogues who insist they are definitely not an infamous crime duo known as the Ghost Bandits — spoiler alert, they are — and simply want to prevent their daughter Parker (Nina Dobrev) from marrying a man they see as not good enough.

Owen thinks he can charm anyone, so sets about winning their hearts by getting drunk, jumping out of a plane, and getting a tattoo in a bid to win them over.

Cue a convoluted plot meander which sees Owen teaming up with Billy and Lilly to knock over a rival bank to pay off the Bandits’ debts to a criminal kingpin, and which serves as a jumping-off point for a series of hackneyed jokes about genitalia and inappropriate bodily contact.

Brosnan and Barkin, to their credit, do their best with that they are given, but playing opposite DeVine’s rubber-faced (albeit well-meaning) imbecile would ask a lot of any actors.

EN_UA_300035.txt,Other,Other,"Sen. Graham: Biden's Ukraine Visit 'Sends Right Signal' 

 Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., praised President Joe Biden's surprise Monday visit to Ukraine — four days from the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of the neighboring country — by saying it sends ""the right signal"" to the world.

""I am very pleased that President Biden took the time and effort to visit Ukraine, and meet with President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy,"" Graham said in a statement. ""This was the right signal to send at the right time. A presidential visit to Ukraine, along with the statements made by Vice President [Kamala] Harris at the Munich Security Conference that Russia is committing crimes against humanity in Ukraine, are a powerful combination.""

Last week, Harris said the U.S. has already determined that Russia committed ""crimes against humanity"" during its war with Ukraine, which launched Feb. 24, 2022.

While meeting with Zelenskyy, Biden made a new pledge of $460 million in aid for Ukraine, according to The Washington Post.

Graham would also like U.S. officials to go further with their latest investment by sending advanced fighter jets to Ukraine and designating Russia for the ""State Sponsors of Terror"" list, which currently includes Iran, Cuba, Syria, and North Korea.

""For the visits and statements to matter to their fullest extent, decisive action must immediately follow,"" Graham said.

""We must designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law. That would also help ensure any lethal assistance to Russia, provided by China, is devastating to the Chinese economy ... we should start immediately training Ukrainian pilots and maintainers, and provide them the advanced fighter jets to not only win this war, but deter future aggression.""

Biden's visit to Ukraine drew criticism from prominent Republicans, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Chief among Republican complaints: Biden visited Ukraine, which isn't a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), but has yet to visit the embattled Ohio village of East Palestine, which is dealing with the fallout of a recent 50-car train derailment, toxic chemical spill, and subsequent chemical explosion.

 Under the guise of 'fighting climate change,' the regime has now proposed new regulations that target some of the most commonly used household appliances, including dishwashers. According to Fox Business, the Department of Energy has proposed new rules that would reduce the current limits for water and energy use in dishwashers.

The proposed rules would limit dishwashers to using 3.2 gallons of water per cycle, significantly lower than the current limit of 5 gallons, and manufacturers would need to reduce their products’ energy consumption by almost 30 percent. Even though most dishwashers available on the market already meet or exceed the current federal standards, the proposed rules have left some questioning why the Biden administration is focusing on such regulations rather than other priorities.

“Dishwashers are not the only appliances Biden’s DOE has set its sights on, however, as the regulator is also considering crackdowns on washers, dryers and refrigerators that manufacturers say could reduce performance,” Fox Business noted further.

Members of the regime have been clear: The rule changes pertain to Biden’s ‘climate agenda.’

“Collectively these energy efficiency actions … support President Biden’s ambitious clean energy agenda to combat the climate crisis,” the DOE wrote earlier this year.

“This Administration is using all of the tools at our disposal to save Americans money while promoting innovations that will reduce carbon pollution and combat the climate crisis,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm stated in a Friday news release.

Critics have also poked major holes in the regime's claim that the new rules are going to save American consumers oodles of money each year.

“The department estimates that consumers will save $3 billion over the next 30 years, or $100 million per year, on their utility bills thanks to the rougher rules,” Christian Britschgi wrote at Reason. “That’s a pretty small per capita savings when spread across the 89 million dishwasher-owning households.”

In fact, he noted that the new rules actually might lead to more water use:

The new regulations might lead to more water usage as individuals switch to washing dishes by hand, Britschgi pointed out, citing research from the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI).

The think tank’s proposal led President Donald Trump’s administration to approve a new class of dishwashers that clean dishes in one hour, though Biden’s team repealed the pro-consumer regulatory agenda of his predecessor.

The proposed dishwasher regulations follow a recent debate over gas stoves at the national level. Despite Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s reassurances that there is nothing to be concerned about, just last week his home state of New York prohibited gas stoves.

“Nobody is taking away your gas stove,” Schumer tweeted in early February. “Shameless and desperate MAGA Republicans are showing us they will cook up any distraction to divert from real issues the American people want solved, like the debt ceiling.”

That turned out to be 100 percent false, obviously.

“Nevertheless, New York lawmakers agreed to ban gas stove hookups in all future buildings in late April. The ban will affect new construction on small buildings in 2025 and move on to larger buildings by 2028,” Fox Business added.

In a statement last month, Consumer Product Safety Commission Commissioner Richard Trumka Jr., a Democratic activist and labor union leader, suggested that stoves could pose a “hidden hazard” to users and that ""any option is on the table."" However, after receiving backlash, Chairman Alex Hoehn-Saric clarified that the agency had no plans to ban stoves.

But in February, the Energy Department went ahead with a new proposal that would allow government regulators to write energy consumption standards for the appliances, the Daily Wire reported.

 Spain: Thousands evacuated over La Palma wildfireJuly 16, 2023

Favorable weather conditions have allowed firefighters on the Spanish island of La Palma to slow the advance of wildfires that forced thousands of people to evacuate Saturday.

More than 4,000 people were told to evacuate, authorities said, and at least 20 houses were destroyed.

""There has been some resistance by local people to leaving their homes, but I appeal to people to be responsible,"" Fernando Clavijo, the regional president of the Canary Islands, told reporters.

Clavijo also said the fire ""advanced very quickly"" due to ""the wind, the climate conditions as well as the heat wave that we are living through."" Like the Spanish mainland, La Palma has also seen far less rain than usual over the past several years as a result of climate change.

So far, about 4,600 hectares or 11,300 acres of land have been destroyed by the fire, authorities said.

Firefighters battle to put out blaze

Spain's army has deployed some 300 of its firefighters to help local crews battle the blaze. The military has dispatched nine water-carrying helicopters and two airplanes to the scene.

On Sunday, 86 members of Spain's Military Emergency Unity also arrived on the island.

The fire is on the western side of the island on wooded, hilly terrain dotted with homes.

La Palma, with a population of 85,000, is one of eight members of Spain’s Canary Islands archipelago off Africa’s western coast. In 2021, it was hit by a volcanic eruption that lasted around three months, forcing thousands to evacuate and causing around €900 million ($1.01 billion) of damage.

Patricia Sanchez of the Spanish Red Cross told AFP news agency she felt ""powerless"" in knowing that ""there are people who lost everything because of the volcano and have rebuilt their lives in the north, and now they are evacuated again... and risk losing everything again.""

The wildfire on La Palma coincides with blistering heat that has swept southern European countries, as scientists warn climate change could significantly increase wildfires across the globe.

EN_UA_300108.txt,URW: Discrediting Ukraine,URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies,"Vantage | Is poisoning of Ukraine spy chief's wife part of old Russia playbook? 

 As the Russia-Ukraine conflict enters its grim second year, a new and ominous chapter has unfolded with the poisoning of Marianna Budanova, the wife of Ukraine’s spy chief, Kyrylo Budanov. This incident marks a disturbing turn in the ongoing hostilities between the two nations, raising questions about the methods employed and the potential infiltration of intelligence agencies.

The conflict has reached a virtual stalemate with both sides fortifying their positions as winter sets in. President Volodymyr Zelensky’s counteroffensive has stalled and Russia maintains its occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine. As the war approaches its two-year mark, tensions continue to escalate.

F-16 factor

The focus now shifts to the military strategies employed by both sides. Ukraine is placing its hopes on the acquisition of F-16 fighter jets with expectations of receiving the first batch before the new year. Meanwhile, Russia appears to be resorting to covert tactics introducing the alarming element of poison into the conflict.

The use of poison, a notorious tool in Putin’s arsenal to silence critics, has now found its way to the Ukrainian battlefield. Marianna Budanova has become the first known target of this insidious method. Reports indicate that the Ukrainian intelligence unit G-U-R, responsible for the country’s security, has confirmed her poisoning along with several other officials, all now hospitalised.

The aftermath of Marianna Budanova’s poisoning raises serious questions about a potential breach in Ukraine’s intelligence unit. Accusations are being thrown between the two nations with Russia placing blame on Ukraine citing it as a case of infighting. This incident sheds light on the vulnerability of high-profile Ukrainian leaders and their families.

Kyrylo Budanov: A targeted spy chief

Kyrylo Budanov, a 37-year-old Lieutenant General and chief of Ukraine’s main spy agency since 2020, has been a thorn in Moscow’s side. Known for orchestrating attacks deep inside Russian territory, Budanov has survived at least 10 assassination attempts including a botched car bombing in 2019. His actions have made him a hate figure in Russia further escalating tensions.

Moscow has levied charges against Budanov, linking his unit to the killings of pro-war Russian figures, including Vladlen Tatarsky, a blogger, and Darya Dugina, a journalist and the daughter of a close ally of Putin. These charges make Budanov a prime target for Russian agencies.

History of covert poisoning in Russia

The use of poison as a weapon is not new in Russian tactics. Notable victims include Alexei Navalny, Putin’s vocal opposition politician currently serving a 30-year jail term, and the 2018 poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in London. The recurring theme of poisoning critics underscores the ruthless methods employed by Russian intelligence.

The poisoning of Marianna Budanova adds a sinister dimension to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As the war rages on, the international community watches with concern, grappling with the use of poison as a tool of war. The incident raises urgent questions about the safety of high-profile individuals and the potential infiltration of intelligence units, further complicating an already volatile situation.

 New Jersey Natural Gas Announces Installation of State’s First CarbinX Carbon Capture Units

Building on its commitment to develop and deploy innovative approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, New Jersey Natural Gas (NJNG), the principal subsidiary of New Jersey Resources (NYSE: NJR), announced it has installed and is now operating two CarbinX carbon-capture systems at its Wall, N.J. headquarters. These units are the first of their kind in operation in New Jersey.

Each CarbinX unit is about the size of two residential refrigerators and connects to NJNG’s HVAC system, where it captures carbon emissions from the building that otherwise would be emitted as flue exhaust. The units also improve the overall efficiency of the facility’s water heater by converting waste heat to heated water – thus, decreasing water heater usage, reducing emissions and lowering energy costs.

“Innovation is critical to achieving our climate and emissions reduction goals in a way that is affordable, reliable and achievable,” said Patrick Migliaccio, senior vice president and chief operating officer at New Jersey Natural Gas. “The carbon capture units installed at our Wall headquarters are part of NJNG’s broader decarbonization strategy to reduce emissions from our operations and support New Jersey’s climate objectives in a way that is easy to adopt.”

Developed by Canada-based CleanO2, CarbinX is a breakthrough technology that converts carbon emissions into a nontoxic solid called pearl ash. Pearl ash can be repurposed for different applications, including commercial products such as soaps and detergents and durable building materials.

Additionally, NJNG is engaging with a third party to perform monitoring, data collection and an in-depth evaluation to fully understand the systems’ real-world benefits. This information will enable NJNG to inform customers and state policymakers about the potential of this technology to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.

“Distributed carbon capture is about more than just reducing emissions; it is also about maximizing the efficiency of the energy we use,” Migliaccio added. “As a flue gas economizer, these carbon-capture units can help businesses use less energy and take advantage of benefits offered under the state’s energy-efficiency programs. The installation of units like these is another way for businesses to help lower their carbon footprint. We look forward to learning from this project and identifying future opportunities.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],new jersey natural gas announce installation state carbinx carbon capture unit new jersey natural gas announce installation state carbinx carbon capture unit build commitment develop deploy innovative approach reduce greenhouse gas emission new jersey natural gas njng principal subsidiary new jersey resources nyse njr announce instal operate carbinx carbon capture system wall n.j headquarters unit kind operation new jersey carbinx unit size residential refrigerator connect njng hvac system capture carbon emission building emit flue exhaust unit improve overall efficiency facility water heater convert waste heat heated water decrease water heater usage reduce emission lower energy cost innovation critical achieve climate emission reduction goal way affordable reliable achievable say patrick migliaccio senior vice president chief operating officer new jersey natural gas carbon capture unit instal wall headquarters njng broad decarbonization strategy reduce emission operation support new jersey climate objective way easy adopt develop canada base cleano carbinx breakthrough technology convert carbon emission nontoxic solid call pearl ash pearl ash repurpose different application include commercial product soap detergent durable building material additionally njng engage party perform monitoring data collection depth evaluation fully understand system real world benefit information enable njng inform customer state policymaker potential technology increase efficiency reduce emission distribute carbon capture reduce emission maximize efficiency energy use migliaccio add flue gas economizer carbon capture unit help business use energy advantage benefit offer state energy efficiency program installation unit like way business help lower carbon footprint look forward learn project identify future opportunity

Shyam Bishen, the head of the Centre for Health and Healthcare, opened the panel dedicated to “Disease X” at the annual World Economic Forum globalist gathering that is taking place this week in Geneva, Switzerland.

Bishen said that he has been working on sustainability and resilience in healthcare for a long time and that we need to prepare the healthcare system for the “looming crisis of climate change.”

He said that this can be achieved through disease surveillance. “How do we make sure that we have a good global data system that can be accessed quickly so that the private sector can come up with countermeasures whether it be vaccines, diagnostics or therapeutics?” he asked.

Disease X serves as a “placeholder for the diseases we don’t know,” and it begins with private-sector research and development to test drugs and “other things.”

Tedros stressed that the next pandemic is “not a matter of if, but rather when,” while noting that COVID-19 was the original Disease X, in which they were able to facilitate the Pandemic Fund in partnership with the World Bank.

For this reason, Tedros urges nations not to let national interests obstruct cooperation with the WHO's proposed pandemic agreement that will amend existing, legally binding international health regulations.

EN_UA_101189.txt,URW: Praise of Russia,URW: Praise of Russia: Russian invasion has strong national support,"Football international joins Putin’s hooligan unit in Ukraine as battalion led by ultra dubbed The Spaniard boosts ranks 

 A FORMER football star has joined an army unit of Russian hooligans on the frontline in Ukraine.

It comes as the battalion - led by an ultra dubbed The Spaniard - steps up recruitment in a desperate bid to boost ranks as Russian invaders continue to meet stiff Ukrainian resistance.

The brigade, named Espanola, is filled with thugs from the terraces and has now been given special status among armed forces backing Vladimir Putin.

Hooligans were recruited too, but now the unit is classed as a separate private military company, with the go-ahead to expand recruitment.

The ultras are urged: ""Get into the coolest adventures of your life with a real chance to come back alive from these scrapes.”

They are promised a “decent reward” for turning their violent instincts on Ukraine.

More on Russia

Former Russian international footballer Andrey Solomatin, 47, has signed up.

He played for Moscow clubs CSKA and Lokomotiv.

Stanislav Orlov, commander of Española private military company, said: “We were volunteers, then part of the DPR [Donetsk People’s Republic] forces.

“Recently we managed to get separate status. So now we do not belong to any battalions or divisions.""

Most read in Football

Orlov, whose call sign is ""Spaniard"", said they had been given approval to create a separate battalion, Espanola.

The hooligans’ battalion is 550 strong, including 100 operators of kamikaze drones used to attack Ukraine, he said.

The fighters say they are being equipped by football supporters from across Russia.

Orlov said: “There are a huge number of them.

“All over Russia, in fact - in different cities there are different football teams.

“We tell them what we need [and they provide it].""

Five years ago, Putin’s regime desperately tried to crackdown on Russian hooligans and ultras - using an FSB crackdown to stop them ruining the FIFA World Cup, which Putin hosted.

In 2016, Russian hooligans were in pitch battles with English fans at the UEFA Euro tournament in France.

Now they are formalised as an armed force, and seen as heroes.

Espanola is currently recruiting “stormtroopers”, scout-saboteurs, snipers, drone operators, electronic warfare and air defence operators, portable ground reconnaissance station operators, anti-tank guided missile operators, anti aircraft specialists, communications specialists, mechanic-drivers, and medics.

Would-be fighters are told they will “take a quick but deep course of study in all directions with a real opportunity - or rather the need - to become a ‘universal soldier’.”

They will “become a real military man and benefit the Motherland without delay”.

And the stadium fighters will “get access and learn how to work with the most modern weapons, equipment and technologies"".

Sniper detachments “are provided with all the most advanced technologies — this applies to transport, equipment, and of course [guns].”

Recruits are told they “may not be hooligans, but they should be close to us in spirit and comply with the main principles of Española in life”.

Recruitment sessions have been held in Moscow and St Petersburg, as well as other cities.

They boast recruits from the hooligan armies of clubs like CSKA, Zenit, Spartak, Torpedo and Lokomotiv and the notorious Orel Butchers.

Several are known to have died so far in the war, including CSKA Moscow fan Maxim Shmanin, 44.

from Liberty Sentinel: Tyrants at the United Nations are eager to wage war on farmers by trying to ban meat and, through live animal stem cells, manufacture lab grown meat, explains Debbie Bacigalupi, a cattle rancher in Northern California. “When you say they are coming after me, and they are coming after my family, and […]

 Actress Jane Fonda’s latest performance as a climate change activist drew a slew of criticism as she protested the Alberta oil sands in the Canadian province.

Fonda was castigated by locals, ambushed by a social media reporter and criticized by a left-leaning provincial premier. On Wednesday, at an Edmonton, Alberta news conference, she condemned a fellow-progressive, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, saying that “people shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking Liberals,” and accused him of “betraying” the Paris climate agreement.

Fonda claimed that, like President Barack Obama, her first impression of Trudeau was one of admiration: “When I heard that your prime minister, the shining hope at the … Paris climate talks, who talked so beautifully about needing to meet the requirements of the climate treaty, and respect and hold to the treaties with the Indigenous people, and so forth — such a heroic stance he took there,” Fonda said. “And yet he has betrayed every one of the things that he committed to in Paris.

“I guess the lesson is we shouldn’t be fooled by good-looking liberals, no matter how well spoken they are. What a disappointment.”

But there was disappointment in the remarks of Alberta’s premier, Rachel Notley, who leads the left-leaning provincial New Democratic Party. She called Fonda “tone deaf” and “ill-informed.”

Fonda received an invitation from the Alberta government to discuss the oil sands but she refused.

“I would suggest if someone was going to come to Alberta … [and] fly over a city that is going through a significant economic downturn, that’s just been through the largest natural disaster in the history of Canada, and then lecture them about where they should get jobs elsewhere, first of all, that’s super tone deaf,” Notley said.

On the first day of her oil sands protest, as she strolled through nearby Fort McMurray, Fonda was ambushed by social media reporter Robbie Picard.

Picard, who hosts the Facebook group OilSands Strong, peppered Fonda with questions about the oil sands, asking her if she was aware of how many First Nations businesses have invested money in the project.

The episode was captured on video by a CBC journalist who was attempting to interview the actress. Fonda did not address any of the questions but insisted, “I’m on your side.”",EN,"['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures']",fonda head canada oil sand protest manage tick actress jane fonda late performance climate change activist draw slew criticism protest alberta oil sand canadian province fonda castigate local ambush social media reporter criticize left lean provincial premier wednesday edmonton alberta news conference condemn fellow progressive canadian prime minister justin trudeau say people shouldn fool good look liberal accuse betray paris climate agreement fonda claim like president barack obama impression trudeau admiration hear prime minister shine hope paris climate talk talk beautifully need meet requirement climate treaty respect hold treaty indigenous people forth heroic stance take fonda say betray thing commit paris guess lesson shouldn fool good look liberal matter speak disappointment disappointment remark alberta premier rachel notley lead left lean provincial new democratic party call fonda tone deaf ill inform fonda receive invitation alberta government discuss oil sand refuse suggest go come alberta fly city go significant economic downturn large natural disaster history canada lecture job super tone deaf notley say day oil sand protest stroll nearby fort mcmurray fonda ambush social medium reporter robbie picard picard host facebook group oilsand strong pepper fonda question oil sand ask aware nation business invest money project episode capture video cbc journalist attempt interview actress fonda address question insist

 Ukraine: You Break It, We Take It

Authored by Citizen Soldier via RealClearDefense,

All Aboard! Here comes the latest Postwar Gravy Train, laden with massive government spending, lax oversight and other goodies for cunning contractors and economic opportunists seeking to benefit from the near-destruction of Ukraine.

Last week, the State Department announced it intends to seize Russian assets in the United States to help fund rebuilding efforts, though the estimated $300 billion here and in Europe won’t cover the projected price tag of $500 billion. “What Putin destroyed, Russia should – must – pay to rebuild,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.

Like an earlier generation of interventionists, Blinken cites the “Pottery Barn rule” – You Break It, You Own It – to explain an aggressor’s moral obligation to rebuild. Colin Powell used the same reasoning in the summer of 2002, as a ""caution"" to President George W. Bush about the consequences of military action in Iraq. A major difference is the dollars at stake. American and European firms undoubtedly are eager to reconstruct a modern, high-tech country from the ground up.

Our government seeks every opportunity to impose itself, at home and abroad, but has a poor track record for managing projects.

No-bid contract awards, bribes and billions of missing dollars are the legacy of the Coalition Provisional Authority’s rebuilding work in Iraq, where officials concluded that not enough was accomplished for the amount of funds expended. We learned that when taxpayer money is plentiful, oversight and results will be negligible. Just imagine how generous and hands-off our government might be spending Russia’s money.

Not everyone endorses the act of confiscating Russia’s money, pointing to the principle of reciprocity as a reason to show restraint. “Stealing” the assets of a foreign country sets a dangerous precedent that could be applied against us. For example, what if China confiscates American assets to fund rebuilding projects in Libya, Iraq or other nations the United States has damaged through war?

The DC hype-meisters talk about the Great Power Competition of wannabe superpowers; they tell us that China is on the brink of becoming the dominant international force, that Russia is preparing to seize all of Europe. Here, though, the façade falls away—the elites believe the United States has no economic or military peers. When you’re as rich and mighty as America, there’s no fear of reciprocity.

The elites will do what’s in the immediate best interest of their friends, which include certain corporations and investors who will benefit from the most extensive international project since World War II. For this group, the only morality is a morality of power: Treating other nations the way you want to be treated is a rule for losers and weaker players.

Blinken and the politicians talk about our categorical imperative in Ukraine, how the world relies on America to “defend democracy” and “protect the rules-based order.” But their words ring hollow. The cynical truth is that what Russia breaks, America will take—using confiscated money to fund a massive rebuilding project that will be poorly managed, but lucrative for the chosen few involved.

 Appetite for Destruction: US Gambles on New Texas Factory to Churn Out Ammo for Ukraine

The Ukraine proxy conflict continues to feed the insatiable US cycle of arms spending and production, with yet another newly-unveiled manufacturing facility joining its ranks.

A Texas factory that reportedly cost US$500 million to build is geared towards boosting the gravy train of US warmongers.

NATO’s proxy conflict in Ukraine has an avid appetite for ammunition and has eaten its way into both US and EU stocks with lackluster results to show for it. The Pentagon is hoping the General Dynamics facility in Mesquite, Texas, will help satiate this ammo craving.

American factories in Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, together produce about 36,000 155mm shells per month. Managed by General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems (GD.N), the new Universal Artillery Projectile Lines facility jam-packed with cutting-edge machinery can churn out 30,000 units per month for the Kiev regime.

Screenshot of production line for making 155-millimeter shells at the General Dynamics facility in Mesquite, Texas.

The plant was bankrolled through supplemental spending bills from FY 2022 and 2023, and boasts three production lines. Its novel equipment enables the manufacture of various shells and mortars on the same line. Empty shells made in Mesquite will be sent to a plant in Burlington, Iowa, for filling. The target goal is to churn out a monthly amount of 100,000 by the end of 2025.

Ukraine will not launch its own production of 155 mm caliber shells until the second half of 2024, The Washington Post has quoted sources as saying.— Sputnik (@SputnikInt) March 20, 2024

According to a source, there is a catastrophic shortage of these shells on the front line, but production will not begin until ""the… pic.twitter.com/sRJ8D9a8CL

The United States and European countries have shipped tens of billions-worth of sophisticated military hardware to Ukraine, emptying their own armories of critical arms and ammunition stocks. None of the pricey hardware that taxpayers were fleeced over has helped Kiev, as the Zelensky regime racks up huge manpower losses in the face of consistent gains by Russia’s military. In the meantime, American weapons makers have been enjoying a profit-making bonanza, fueled by the “well-greased” machine of lobbying in the US Congress.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests']",appetite destruction gamble new texas factory churn ammo ukraine appetite destruction gamble new texas factory churn ammo ukraine ukraine proxy conflict continue feed insatiable cycle arm spending production newly unveil manufacturing facility join rank texas factory reportedly cost us$ million build gear boost gravy train warmonger nato proxy conflict ukraine avid appetite ammunition eat way eu stock lackluster result pentagon hope general dynamic facility mesquite texas help satiate ammo craving american factory scranton wilke barre pennsylvania produce mm shell month manage general dynamic ordnance tactical system gd.n new universal artillery projectile line facility jam pack cutting edge machinery churn unit month kiev regime screenshot production line make -millimeter shell general dynamic facility mesquite texas screenshot production line make -millimeter shell general dynamic facility mesquite texas plant bankroll supplemental spending bill fy boast production line novel equipment enable manufacture shell mortar line shell mesquite send plant burlington iowa fill target goal churn monthly end ukraine launch production mm caliber shell second half washington post quote source say sputnik @sputnikint march accord source catastrophic shortage shell line production begin pic.twitter.com/srjdacl united states european country ship ten billion worth sophisticated military hardware ukraine empty armory critical arm ammunition stock pricey hardware taxpayer fleece help kiev zelensky regime rack huge manpower loss face consistent gain russia military meantime american weapon maker enjoy profit make bonanza fuel grease machine lobby congress

This week was a rough week for the people supporting President Biden. IRS whistleblower testimony in Congress under oath made it abundantly clear President Biden and his family enriched themselves at the expense of America. In short, it looks like they took treasonous bribes, and this may be just scratching the surface. How many other people in the Washington, D.C. swamp got a cut of Biden booty? We don’t know, but the evidence presented this week shows the Bidens, including the President (aka “The Big Guy”), took money from foreign sources, including China. The Constitution clearly says a President can be impeached for taking a bribe.

While the Lying Legacy Media ignores evidence of real crime, they are reporting on the crimes being made up by the Biden Administration DOJ. The Deep State wants to jail President Trump so he cannot run in 2024 for another term in the White House. Will they use the J6 strategy that got convictions of 350 protesters at the capitol so far? It sure looks that way, and even President Trump is expecting charges soon, which is the ultimate election interference.

There is no doubt America is at war with Russia. We keep sending in arms and munitions, and there are no peace talks whatsoever. Now, a bridge linking Russia to Crimea has been blown up again, and the Russians responded by destroying a port in Ukraine that exports wheat. Higher food prices and shortages will be hitting the world soon. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar is under attack, and a new global currency is going to be released by the so-called BRICS countries. Is a new currency war coming to go along with the real war already underway? The short answer is yes, and this spells big trouble to the buck.

 If Finland decides to allow a “concentration” of troops on its border with Russia, it would be viewed by Moscow as a threat, the Kremlin said, after Poland offered to send military advisers to help Helsinki monitor the frontier.

The head of the Polish National Security Bureau, Jacek Siewiera, said in a post on social media X that Poland would send military advisers to its NATO ally Finland, in response to “an official request for allied support in the face of a hybrid attack on the Finnish border”.

“A team of military advisers will provide on-site knowledge on border security, also in operational terms,” he said.

Finland said on Thursday it was unaware of the Polish offer. It has closed its entire 1,340 km (833 mile) border with Russia for two weeks in a bid to halt an unusually large flow of asylum seekers that Helsinki says amounts to a “hybrid attack” orchestrated by Moscow, a charge the Kremlin denies.

Asked about the Polish offer to Finland during a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “This is an absolutely redundant measure to ensure border security because there is no threat there.”

“The Finns must be clearly aware that this will pose a threat to us - an increase in the concentration of military units on our borders.”

Any planned deployment would be unprovoked and unjustified, said Peskov.

Finland’s Border Guard and the interior ministry both said they were unaware of any plan to bring Polish military advisers to Finland’s eastern border.

Finnish President Sauli Niinisto held talks with his Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda in Warsaw last week but they did not discuss military cooperation on the Finnish border with Russia, Niinisto’s office said in a statement to Reuters.

EN_CC_100046.txt,Other,Other,"Rumpin Nursery : A Public-Private Partnership in Achieving Indonesia’s Climate Goals 

 s the world faces the critical challenge of climate change, building nurseries has become one of the key ways to mitigate its effects through reforestation and restoration efforts.

In Indonesia, a notable project is the Rumpin Nursery in Bogor, which has emerged as a prominent model of public-private partnership in supporting Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink initiative. Established in 2022, the Rumpin Nursery was inaugurated by President Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and is the result of a collaboration between the Environment and Forestry Ministry, the Public Works and Housing Ministry, and APRIL Group, a pulp and paper producer.

APRIL Group's nursery system in Pangkalan Kerinci, Riau province, inspired the Rumpin Nursery development, which has the capacity of planting approximately 200 million new seedlings per year. The company continues to invest heavily in research and development to increase plantation fiber productivity.

Over the next three years, the Indonesian government plans to build 30 nursery centers, each with an annual production capacity of 10 to 12 million seedlings, which will result in a combined annual production of 360 million seedlings. These seedlings will be used to rehabilitate and restore degraded lands, to be planted on critical land, areas with high landslide potential and upper reaches of river basins (DAS).

The Rumpin Nursery has successfully grown and planted thousands of native tree species, including Manglid, Sengon, Salam and Sirsak. Since President Jokowi's inauguration last year, the nursery has begun distributing seedlings in a number of locations such as the Ciliwung River. Following the Rumpin Nursery's successful collaboration, the government is currently focusing on developing additional nurseries in other regions, including Danau Toba, Likupang, Mentawir and Bali.

By replicating and scaling up such models, Indonesia can unlock the potential of nurseries and other nature-based solutions to achieve its ambitious climate goals. This public-private partnership has enabled the Rumpin Nursery to align with the Indonesian government's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31.89 percent unconditionally by 2030, as per the updated NDC.

As part of its efforts to support Indonesia's restoration and forestry goals, the APRIL Group recently earned an appreciation award for its role in the public-private collaboration that established the Rumpin Nursery.

PT Riau Andalan Pulp and Paper, the operating arm of APRIL Group, also received an appreciation award for its work to improve the performance of industrial forest plantations. Both awards were presented by Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya and received by Sihol Aritonang, president director of PT RAPP.

""APRIL is proud that our technology and seed management system can serve as a reference for nursery development in Indonesia. Through the Rumpin Nursery, we show our continuous support for one of the government's activities in achieving FOLU Net Sink 2030,"" said Sihol.

Indonesia's Forestry and Land Use (FOLU) Net Sink is the newest forest policy in Indonesia that identifies the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) absorption targeted to be equal or higher than emissions in the FOLU sector in 2030. The Net Sink FOLU is projected to contribute up to 60 percent of the Net Zero Emission target by 2060 as part of the country's efforts to achieve its climate goals under the Paris Climate Agreement and to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

The key targets of Indonesia's FOLU Net Sink 2030 include efforts to ensure reduced deforestation and forest degradation, the importance of sustainable forest management, social forestry and land rehabilitation, biodiversity and ecosystem preservation.

EN_UA_300144.txt,Other,Other,"US Viewed More Favorably Than China: Survey 

 The United States is viewed much more favorably than China in 24 countries, most of which are high-income nations, amid growing competition between the two nations, according to the Pew Research Center.

“This year, overall views of the United States are much more positive than views of China in most places surveyed,” Pew Research noted. “But this has not always been the case in our nearly two decades of favorability polling, and views of the countries have fluctuated alongside views of their leaders.”

The poll found that 59 percent have a favorable view of the United States, while 28 percent hold a positive view of China. Regarding the leadership of both nations, 54 percent approve of President Joe Biden, while 19 percent feel the same way about Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

A total of 30,861 adults were surveyed from Feb. 20 to May 22, 2023.

Across countries surveyed, Kenya and Nigeria hold more favorable views of China than the United States. But their ratings for Washington and Beijing are positive, with a favorable view of over 70 percent.

The survey also showed that public opinions for the United States and China vary across the countries surveyed.

In high-income countries, the differences in favor of the United States compared to China are much larger than in middle-income nations, with Poland and Japan having a gap of over 60 percentage points.

But in middle-income nations, positive ratings are seen for both countries, leading to a smaller public opinion gap.

The United States gets the lowest ratings in Hungary, where 44 percent hold a favorable view, compared with 55 percent in 2022.

The survey found that “a majority or plurality has favorable views of the United States but not China” in nine countries, such as Poland and Japan, where 63 percent hold a positive view of the United States but a negative view of China.

Most respondents said the United States interferes in other countries’ affairs but contributes to peace and stability worldwide. In Japan, 79 percent said the United States contributes a “fair amount” to global stability, while only 14 percent have the same view as China. Only respondents in Hungary consider that China contributes to world peace more than the United States.

Americans’ Views on ChinaIn May, another survey by the Pew Research Center found that over eight in ten Americans (83 percent) had unfavorable views of China, and the number of people who saw communist China as an enemy surged as the tensions between Washington and Beijing escalated in recent years.

Among 83 percent of Americans with unfavorable views of China, 44 percent said they had very negative views about China.

Around three-quarters of Americans (77 percent) had little or no confidence in Mr. Xi.

A rising number of Americans (38 percent) viewed China as an enemy compared to 25 percent in the January 2022 survey.

About half of American adults (52 percent) viewed China as a competitor, while only 6 percent considered it a partner.

The relationship between Washington and Beijing has deteriorated over the past few years. The two countries have clashed over various issues, such as Taiwan, trade, human rights, and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Beijing-Moscow relations were also a significant concern for Americans, particularly amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This issue concerned Americans more than any other issues in the U.S.-China relationship, including trade, Taiwan, or human rights.

Following Mr. Xi’s meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his Moscow visit in March, 62 percent of Americans see the China-Russia alliance as a severe problem for the United States.

For the Taiwan issue, poll respondents also see correlations between Russia’s treatment of Ukraine and the Chinese regime’s treatment of Taiwan, as many Americans hold much more favorable views of Taiwan (65 percent) than China (14 percent).",EN,['Other'],['Other'],view favorably china survey united states view favorably china country high income nation amid grow competition nation accord pew research center year overall view united states positive view china place survey pew research note case nearly decade favorability polling view country fluctuate alongside view leader poll find percent favorable view united states percent hold positive view china leadership nation percent approve president joe biden percent feel way chinese leader xi jinping total adult survey feb country survey kenya nigeria hold favorable view china united states rating washington beijing positive favorable view percent survey show public opinion united states china vary country survey high income country difference favor united states compare china large middle income nation poland japan have gap percentage point middle income nation positive rating see country lead small public opinion gap united states get low rating hungary percent hold favorable view compare percent survey find majority plurality favorable view united states china country poland japan percent hold positive view united states negative view china respondent say united states interfere country affair contribute peace stability worldwide japan percent say united states contribute fair global stability percent view china respondent hungary consider china contribute world peace united states americans view chinain survey pew research center find americans percent unfavorable view china number people see communist china enemy surge tension washington beijing escalate recent year percent americans unfavorable view china percent say negative view china quarter americans percent little confidence mr xi rise number americans percent view china enemy compare percent january survey half american adult percent view china competitor percent consider partner relationship washington beijing deteriorate past year country clash issue taiwan trade human right origin covid- pandemic beijing moscow relation significant concern americans particularly amid russia invasion ukraine issue concern americans issue u.s.-china relationship include trade taiwan human right follow mr xi meeting russian counterpart vladimir putin moscow visit march percent americans china russia alliance severe problem united states taiwan issue poll respondent correlation russia treatment ukraine chinese regime treatment taiwan americans hold favorable view taiwan percent china percent

Answer: WWIII. 

What is the current trajectory of the evil empire? Answer: WWIII.
You might not know it.
But Russia does.
That’s why it is delaying its offensive in Ukraine.
To give it time to prepare for the worst.
It could easily overun Ukraine and end the war in its favour but that will result in all out war from the West.
That’s the only explanation.

The evil empire wants the phoenix from the ashes.
They know, or they at least think they will be the only ones capable of taking power once it is all over.
They do not care about human life except their own.
They have the means to exterminate all life on earth and that is what they will do to aquire the god status promised them by their god.
They have no reason to disbelieve him.

Look at the power and wealth they already have. It was promised them and he delivered. What more needs to be said.
They forget they are still of this world and once they die all bets are off.
Evil = stupid.
Satan himself is evil therefore stupid.
It’s a case of the blind deceiving the blind.

None of it matters to us.
Not as long as we are not sucked into the evil which is what they are trying to do through the mass media, normalising evil, presenting it as the only available option.
This takes many forms and part of it is to force you to accept knowing lies so that you become a willing subservient slave of the lie, a willing, knowing slave of the lie. A laughable person, by any standard.
With all this going on is it any wonder the Bible says people will all be microchipped willingly.
All but the few.
This is troublesome

The few will be guillotined but is it possible many more will be raptured away beforehand?
There are indications of this in the Bible.
The fire and thunder preachers of the past, the righteous ones, it is clear, we’re right after all, from current events where it will take all our efforts in that regard to avoid eternal hellfire.

Tata Steel has not made any purchase of PCI coal from Russia post its April announcement of severing business ties with Russia amid the ongoing conflict with Ukraine, a company spokesperson said on Wednesday.

On April 20, Tata Steel had said it would stop doing business with Russia. To ensure business continuity, all its steel manufacturing sites in India, the UK and the Netherlands have sourced alternative supplies of raw materials to end its dependence on Russia.

""Tata Steel would like to issue a clarification in view of the incorrect information floating around in some sections of the media with respect to the buying/ importing of coal from Russia,"" the spokesperson said.

A deal for supply of 75,000 tonne of PCI coal was finalised in March 2022 and the contract became effective weeks before Tata Steel's April announcement.

 Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses an annual press conference in Budapest, Hungary, December 21, 2022. 

The single or ""biggest loser"" of the Russia-Ukraine conflicts which triggered EU sanctions against Russia is Europe and the U.S. is the winner of the conflicts, said Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, reiterating his stand in an interview with Hungarian television on Friday.

He pointed out that the EU is not brave enough to admit that its sanctions policy is wrong, and Hungary is not capable enough to change the position of other larger countries, so sanctions against Russia, though ineffective, are likely to remain in place.

Orban previously said that Europe, for its ally the U.S., gave up Russian energy and was forced to pay 5 to 10 times of fee for energy, which had also driven up inflation.

According to the data published by the Hungarian central statistics office on Friday, Hungary's average consumer price index (CPI) rose by 14.5 percent in 2022, compared with 5.1 percent in 2021. And Hungary's CPI in December 2022 rose by 24.5 percent compared with the same month in 2021, the highest increase since March 1996. Food prices in Hungary also rose by 44.8 percent in December 2022, compared to the same month in 2021.

Since the outbreak of the Ukraine conflict, Europe has encountered a severe energy crisis. Bloomberg reported that Europe lost one trillion U.S. dollars by rejecting Russian energy while the U.S. is selling its LNG to Europe at three to four times the price in the U.S., which drew criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron, saying it is a practice that ""is not what true friends would do and must stop.""

 As US, EU Pile New Sanctions On Russia, WSJ Declares Punitive Measures Already ""Failed""

The US and EU on Friday are piling on fresh anti-Russia sanctions as the war in Ukraine reaches two years (Saturday marking the date of the invasion) and in the wake of Alexei Navalny's death in prison last week, which Russia has officially said was due to ""natural causes"".

The US Treasury Department on Friday is unveiling over 500 new sanctions on Russia and industries connected to war sector. It's being hailed the single largest tranche of penalties slapped on Moscow since the war's start. This included export restrictions imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals.

""The American people and people around the world understand that the stakes of this fight extend far beyond Ukraine,"" President Biden said in a statement which first unveiled the planned sanctions. ""If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going. And the costs to the United States — along with our NATO Allies and partners in Europe and around the world — will rise.""

Biden has further said the fresh action ""will ensure"" President Putin ""pays an even steeper price for his aggression abroad and repression at home."" Washington has also sought to target individuals and entities connected with Navalny's imprisonment.

The new Friday statement prepared by the White House additionally stated, ""Two years ago, he tried to wipe Ukraine off the map. If Putin does not pay the price for his death and destruction, he will keep going.""

As for ""paying the price"" - just as Biden issued these words, The Wall Street Journal observed that two years after the invasion, the ""biggest ever"" sanctions are failing and have failed:

Two years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Western sanctions have failed in their most important task—stopping the Kremlin’s war machine.

Western officials and experts say the financial, economic, military and energy sanctions imposed on Russia since February 2022 have damaged Russia’s economy and arms-production capacity, and will create serious problems for the Kremlin in the coming years. But they acknowledge the restrictions have hit more slowly than they hoped.

The report further acknowledges the merely symbolic nature of the new sanctions: ""U.S. officials privately concede that the new measures set to to be announced Friday are likely to land a limited blow.""

Could a future Trump administration make a U-turn on the Russia sanctions as part of potential negotiations to end the war?

EN_CC_100146.txt,Other,Other,"Astronaut Catches ""Transient Luminous Event"" High Above The Earth 

 European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Andreas Mogensen has captured a new image of a red sprite, a rare type of electrical discharge rarely seen from Earth.

As part of the Thor-Davis experiment, Danish astronaut Mogensen heads to the International Space Station's (ISS) Cupola observatory module every Saturday to attempt to photograph storms from above. In the first image released by the experiment, which aims to study intense thunderstorms from a better vantage point as well as weather phenomena in high altitude, a Transient Luminous Event (TLE) is seen between 40 and 80 kilometers (25-50 miles) above the Earth.

TLEs, sometimes called ""sprites"", ""red sprites"", or ""red jellyfish sprites"", have been reported by pilots for decades, but were only recorded for the first time in July 1989. They are rarely seen from the surface, which is probably for the best, given the illusion they create of an invading alien space force.

Like regular lightning strikes, the sprites occur following a build-up of electrical charge within clouds. With red sprites, however, the discharge occurs into the Earth's mesosphere up to 80 kilometers (50 miles) above the Earth. The eerie red color occurs as the charge meets nitrogen in the Earth's atmosphere.

Mogensen captured the sprite with an ""event camera"", which according to ESA works more like a human eye than a regular camera, sensing changes in contrast rather than capturing an image. An advantage of these cameras is they can produce around 100,000 images a second, while drawing very little power to do so. Among other aims, the study strives to better understand how lightning in the upper atmosphere affects the concentration of greenhouse gases.

“These images taken by Andreas are fantastic,"" Olivier Chanrion, lead scientist for this experiment, told ESA of this first image from it.

EN_CC_100172.txt,Other,Other,"How Do Animals React During a Total Solar Eclipse? 

 When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes?

Researchers will be standing by to observe how animals’ routines at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas are disrupted when skies dim on April 8, The Associated Press reported. They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.

“To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals.

While there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals.

Seven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, “that generally do absolutely nothing all day ... during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding,” said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.

A mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in “apparent anxiety.” The flamingos huddled around their juveniles.

Researchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk.

In April, Hartstone-Rose’s team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns.

Several other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.

This year’s full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.

“It’s really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we can’t repeat the experiment,"" said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.

The honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.

“During a solar eclipse, there’s a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment,” said University of Alberta's Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate.

Nate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that “solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms,” when skies darken and many animals take shelter.

After the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction they’re moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, “probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains.”

The last full US solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.

Most songbird species migrate at night. “When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think it’s time to migrate and take flight?” said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.

His team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data – which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects – to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse.

As for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing – whether they’re excited or nonchalant about the eclipse – as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch.

“Dogs and cats pay a lot of attention to us, in addition to their internal clocks,” she said.

“The place I was at is 200 meters from my business. Several improvised incendiary structures were found in the area. In the previous days, the suburbs and settlements of Alexandroupolis had been evacuated, as well as the University General Hospital. Naturally, all the residents had lost sleep and were on the alert for the fire to find us during the night.

“At the specific point between Alexandroupoli and S. Chile, behind a supermarket chain, I spotted a group of 13 people who were around an object and were trying to set it on fire while holding a balloon that smelled of gasoline, and they also brought a knife with them….

“I didn’t care if they were immigrants if they came from Albania, Syria, Greece or Australia. I am neither a fascist nor a racist, and I am sure that my fellow citizens of Alexandroupoli with whom I have been doing business all these years know that,” he concluded….

The 13 illegal immigrants, who were illegally kept in a trailer by three citizens in Alexandroupolis, are accused of attempted arson….

EN_UA_102054.txt,URW: Amplifying war-related fears,URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other,"UK Intelligence Experts Concerned Russia Will Use ‘Fabricated’ Chemical Weapons Claims in ‘False-Flag’ Attack on Ukraine 

 UK intelligence experts are concerned that Russia will use “fabricated” claims regarding chemical weapons in Ukraine to move forward with a “false-flag operation.”

“Russia could possibly be planning to use chemical or biological weapons in a ‘false-flag’ operation. Such an operation could take the form of a faked attack, a staged ‘discovery’ of agents or munitions, or fabricated evidence of alleged Ukrainian planning to use such weapons,” officials said, adding that such a “false-flag” attack would “almost certainly be accompanied by extensive disinformation to complicate attribution.”

Officials added that intelligence suggests that Moscow had likely intended to use false-flag operations as justification for its invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24.

However, analysts believe that the narrative is part of the Kremlin’s plan to create a false-flag operation in an attempt to justify using chemical weapons operations in Ukraine itself.

Yet both the United States and Ukraine maintain that the laboratories seek to prevent bioweapons and pathogens, a project backed by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, an agency within the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).

In response to Russia’s allegations, State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement that the disinformation being spread by Russia is “total nonsense and not the first time Russia has invented such false claims against another country.”

The UK Ministry of Defence’s report comes as NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on March 13 that the Kremlin might use chemical or biological weapons in its invasion of Ukraine, which would amount to a war crime.

The NATO Secretary General echoed comments by the UK’s Ministry of Defense that Russia could be using the claims to create a false pretext to justify its actions.

“Now that these false claims have been made, we must remain vigilant because it is possible that Russia itself could plan chemical weapons operations under this fabrication of lies.

 Climate activists dump pink powder on case containing US Constitution

Two climate change activists appeared in court on Thursday for throwing pink powder on glass cases displaying the U.S. Constitution at the National Archives Museum in Washington, according to the U.S. attorney's office and court records.

Two climate change activists appeared in court on Thursday for throwing pink powder on glass cases displaying the U.S. Constitution at the National Archives Museum in Washington, according to the U.S. attorney's office and court records. The revered founding document, written on four sheets of parchment in 1787, was protected by its display encasement and not damaged, the National Archives said.

Police arrested Donald Zepeda and Jackson Green on Wednesday afternoon for what the National Archives called an act of vandalism after they dispersed balloons filled with magenta pink tempera paint powder across the display, according to a court filing by a special agent in the archive's inspector general's office. The museum's rotunda was closed for cleaning on Thursday, costing the government $15,780.62, according to the filing in the D.C. Superior Court. It will remain closed on Friday.

Videos posted on social media showed the two men stood by the powder-dusted cases in the museum's grand rotunda with their hands and clothes covered in the pink powder. Paraphrasing the Constitution, they told onlookers they believed everyone on the planet had a right to clean air and a livable climate, and called on U.S. President Joe Biden to declare a climate emergency, shortly before they were detained by museum security staff.

They were arrested on charges of defacing and destruction of public property under Washington local law, according to the court filing, a crime with a maximum sentence of up to 180 days in prison. It was not clear if they would also face more serious federal charges of destruction of government property. One of the two men told investigators they were part of the Declare Emergency campaign, which says it uses civil resistance techniques to try and force the U.S. government to take emergency action on climate change.

The campaign did not immediately respond to questions on Thursday, but shared videos of the episode on social media, writing: ""We the people will not stand for corporate greed and climate destruction."" In recent years, climate activists around the world have targeted revered paintings and other cultural artifacts to draw attention to their cause.

In 2022, an activist threw cake at Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa at the Louvre in Paris. A few months later, two activists splashed the glass case protecting Vincent van Gogh's Fifteen Sunflowers with tomato soup at London's National Gallery, causing minor damage to the frame. Other activists have glued themselves to famous artworks. The National Archives said the rotunda and the display of the Constitution would reopen soon.

""We take such vandalism very seriously and we will insist that the perpetrators be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" Archivist of the United States Colleen Shogan said in a statement. Neither of the men could immediately be reached for comment and it was not clear if they were represented by lawyers. They are due back in court on March 20th, and meanwhile have been ordered not to return to the National Archives.

 Republican lawmakers will probe the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and large private investors for their role in pushing an environmental agenda throughout the financial sector after the midterm elections.

Republican Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, said that investigating the Biden administration and Wall Street’s use of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles will be a major focus of his committee if Republicans gain a majority in the House on Nov. 8, according to The Washington Post. The lawmakers argue that large financial institutions have withheld investment from businesses that they don’t consider to be eco-friendly based on their ESG criteria. (RELATED: Kentucky Officials Demand Proof That State Pension Funds Aren’t Used For Woke Investing)

“My view is that ESG investing is a cancer within our capital markets,” Barr told the Post. “It is a fraud on American investors.”

Barr and other Republicans hope to force SEC Chairman Gary Gensler to answer questions on the agency’s proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require all publicly traded companies to disclose their carbon emissions and climate change risks, the Post reported. The rule could allow climate-focused investors to more easily discern the “climate risks” of certain businesses and pressure them to become more eco-friendly.

Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska introduced a bill in May to combat major investors’ influence and will continue discussing such actions with industry executives, his spokesman told the Post.

“We’ve become the loud noise in their right ear after all the screaming in their left ear,” Republican Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said about GOP efforts to push back against Wall Street firms’ climate-focused investment strategies, according to the Post.

Republican Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer of Missouri and ranking member on the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions told the Post that he wants to force BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street executives to testify in front of the financial services committee as the three massive money managers have used their financial influence to push companies to adopt their climate agenda and other political movements.

BlackRock, which manages nearly $8 trillion in assets, has been scrutinized by Republican attorneys general and state treasurers over its alleged failure to place the interests of its investors above the firm’s stance on climate change.

The Republicans are expected to take back the House in the midterm elections and will hold a majority in the House Financial Services Committee as well as other committees that can be used to probe the SEC, banks and asset managers.

EN_CC_100067.txt,Other,Other,"Danish envoy highlights carbon markets as key to Pakistan’s green development 

 ISLAMABAD - Ambassador of Denmark, Jakob Linulf has said that carbon markets are a new opportunity for Pakistan to improve its economic situation and reduce carbon emissions for a green development through sustainable and environment friendly practices.

Climate change was casting adverse impacts on the globe and it was equally important for Pakistan and Denmark to develop strategies for averting its risks to humanity and biodiversity, said Ambassador Jakob Linulf while addressing to the one-day capacity building workshop for journalists on Climate-Smart Reporting: Carbon Market and Equitable Development jointly organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) and the Embassy of Denmark here Thursday.

He said Denmark had completed its green transition and transformed its energy sector from a fossil fuel-dependent energy mix to a greener one based on solar, wind, and biomass. “Denmark has faced a lot of challenges in the way and that’s why it wants to share its lessons learnt with Pakistan so that it do not repeat the same mistakes,” he said. The Danish ambassador noted that the Danish companies had adequate technologies to address climate change impacts which can collaborate with their Pakistani counterparts.

“Pakistan is facing double crises; economic crisis coupled with climate change as the 2022 floods inundated one third of the country leaving millions of millions displaced and billions of dollars livestock, infrastructure and ready to harvest crops washed away,” he said. He highlighted that carbon market can be an important tool in developing right and efficient tools to benefit from latest mechanisms to cut carbon emission and address climate change but it should be considered as a financial facility alone. He said the business leaders can take the lead to influence green transition especially in the sectors of steel, fertiliser, and cement where carbon adjustment can be one tool alongwith fuel adjustment and waste management. Soren Lutken, Chief Carbon Market Special UNEP Copenhagen said carbon markets is not the only solution to climate crisis as it was not exactly the idea to reduce but shift the emissions from one place to the other.

He said Pakistan is the host of the cheaper emissions reduction mechanism whereas it was imperative to break the myth that it has missed the train to address Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). He said the country needed to come up with a clear policy framework to decide its moment to enter the compliance carbon markets. “There are cooperations available globally that are interested to buy carbon credits that needs to be explored efficiently with clear policy direction and leadership,” he said. Nadeem Nawaz, Special Advisor and Country Manager at Danish Energy Agency and Global Cooperation provided a brief presentation on the long-term energy planning strategies of Pakistan towards 2050.

He said Pakistan needs to be chalk out a credible roadmap that will lead to tempt more investors in the realm of carbon credits’ training. In his opening remarks, Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI said journalists can shape public opinion and guide policymakers on adopting efficient carbon markets, whereas the think-tank and media both can benefit from each other’s experiences to reduce carbon emissions. “It is important to highlight the urgency of climate change and the critical nature of the transformative power of carbon markets as South Asia is suffering from many environmental crises,” he said.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],danish envoy highlight carbon market key pakistan green development islamabad ambassador denmark jakob linulf say carbon market new opportunity pakistan improve economic situation reduce carbon emission green development sustainable environment friendly practice climate change cast adverse impact globe equally important pakistan denmark develop strategy avert risk humanity biodiversity say ambassador jakob linulf address day capacity build workshop journalist climate smart reporting carbon market equitable development jointly organise sustainable development policy institute sdpi embassy denmark thursday say denmark complete green transition transform energy sector fossil fuel dependent energy mix green base solar wind biomass denmark face lot challenge way want share lesson learn pakistan repeat mistake say danish ambassador note danish company adequate technology address climate change impact collaborate pakistani counterpart pakistan face double crisis economic crisis couple climate change flood inundate country leave million million displace billion dollar livestock infrastructure ready harvest crop wash away say highlight carbon market important tool develop right efficient tool benefit late mechanism cut carbon emission address climate change consider financial facility say business leader lead influence green transition especially sector steel fertiliser cement carbon adjustment tool alongwith fuel adjustment waste management soren lutken chief carbon market special unep copenhagen say carbon market solution climate crisis exactly idea reduce shift emission place say pakistan host cheap emission reduction mechanism imperative break myth miss train address carbon border adjustment mechanism cbam say country need come clear policy framework decide moment enter compliance carbon market cooperation available globally interested buy carbon credit need explore efficiently clear policy direction leadership say nadeem nawaz special advisor country manager danish energy agency global cooperation provide brief presentation long term energy planning strategy pakistan say pakistan need chalk credible roadmap lead tempt investor realm carbon credit training opening remark dr abid qaiyum suleri executive director sdpi say journalist shape public opinion guide policymaker adopt efficient carbon market think tank medium benefit experience reduce carbon emission important highlight urgency climate change critical nature transformative power carbon market south asia suffer environmental crisis say
EN_CC_200327.txt,Other,Other,"uk/DeBunked: Spiked's Ella Whelan on Oil and Renewables 


Spiked columnist Ella Whelan made misleading claims about North Sea oil and renewable energy on a recent BBC Question Time.

Here is the evidence for why she’s wrong – and Spiked’s record of climate science denial and fossil fuel funding.

Spiked was introduced as a “non-conformist” outlet on BBC Question Time. In fact it’s a libertarian publication with a history of climate denial and opposing green policies. E.g. In 2018 Spiked published “The Myth of a Climate Crisis” by denier Ben Pile.

Spiked claims to be independent, but between 2015-18 the website received $300,000 from the Charles Koch Foundation, an arm of oil giant Koch Industries and a major funder of climate denial.

On BBC Question Time, Whelan suggested the UK government invest in “new exploration of North Sea oil” to grow the economy.

This statement ignores fossil fuels’ role driving climate impacts and the associated financial risks.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) says any new fossil fuel extraction projects are incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C.

Climate change is already hurting the world economy. Under current policies climate change impacts are projected to cost the UK 7.4 percent of GDP by 2100. Meanwhile, the growing net zero sector employs 850,000 people and is adding £71 billion in Gross Value Added to the UK economy.

Whelan also claimed “wind turbines and solar panels are not going to keep us warm”. In fact, heat pumps, which are powered by electricity, are considered the greenest and most efficient way to heat homes with no need for oil or gas.

Her claim also plays on a common falsehood that wind and solar power are unreliable. In fact in winter 2022, renewables provided more UK electricity than gas power stations: 27 percent of UK electricity was generated by wind, and wind and solar were the EU’s top power source.

The National Grid has said the UK can switch to a 100 percent renewable grid led by wind and solar energy.

In the past, Whelan has claimed to care about climate change, for example in a 2022 interview with TalkTV. But she has also attacked – and misrepresented – efforts to do something about it.

In the same interview, Whelan said the “deluded idea of Net Zero” would mean a “dystopian” scenario in which “people have less, be more miserable, not heat your home, not eat what you want, not travel”.

These critiques are familiar “climate delay narratives”, which paint green action as disruptive and are not a true reflection of plans to reach net zero set out by the UK’s independent Climate Change Committee (CCC), or any other government policy. They also ignore the urgent need to cut emissions and transition to green energy.

Spiked writers like Ella Whelan are frequently hosted on mainstream media without mention of the publication’s history of climate denial and fossil fuel funding.

We hope this thread helps inform future media appearances by Spiked columnists, so that their claims can be challenged with evidence. See more in Spiked’s DeSmog profile here.

 by Prof Michel Chossudovsky, Global Research:

Eight years ago, on 17 July 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) was shot down in Eastern Ukraine.

In recent development, A Netherlands Court on November 17, 2022 found the Kremlin responsible for the alleged attack: two Russians and

a separatist Ukrainian” were identified as “guilty of mass murder for their involvement in the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17”.

The media has highlighted the downing of MH17 in the context of the war in Ukraine. The Court ruling is fraudulent, based on fabricated evidence.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

***

This background text was prepared in the context of the Kuala Lumpur MH17 Conference entitled MH17: The Quest for Justice, organized by JUST, the PGPF and the CRG in August 2019.

This comprehensive report provides detailed evidence that Russia was not involved in the downing of MH17.

It also confirms the insidious role of Ukraine’s intelligence agency.

****

The underlying objective is to examine the evidence, reveal the truth and uphold the rule of law.

Today, July 29th 2021, our thoughts are with the families of the victims of the Malaysian Airlines MH17 tragedy.

The 2019 Conference was dedicated to the memory of the victims.

It is also a national tragedy for the people of Malaysia. The downing of MH17 with 283 passengers and 15 crew on board, took place barely a few months following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 after departing on March 8, 2014 from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing, with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board.

It is worth recalling that immediately after the MH17 plane crash on July 17 2014, prior to the conduct of a preliminary investigation, Secretary of State John Kerry and US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power pointed their finger at Moscow without a shred of evidence. In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.

According to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):

“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)

The Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:

European governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.

European Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.

In Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)

On July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

EU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)

 Exploiting their slight edge in number in the state's House of Representatives, 70-64, the Democrats on Jan. 26 passed the historic legislation banning the mining of primary fossil fuels. This coincided with Biden banning mining in the Iron Range in northeastern Minnesota, which is marked by four major iron ore deposits. (Related: FORCE MAJEURE: Massive global shutdowns are now under way for METALS SMELTING operations covering iron, copper, nickel, aluminum, zinc and STEEL.)

According to Alpha News, the bill on the mining ban got passed after seven hours of debate with the Republicans, who offered several amendments to make the timeline more manageable but got rejected.

The junked amendments included ""lifting the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants; allowing for the use of carbon sequestration technologies; and delaying the standard to consider its impact on child and slave labor in the green energy supply chain.""

Rep. Spencer Igo (R-Wabana Township) said at a press conference ahead of the debate that the bill will make ""Minnesota reliant on nations around the globe that have no labor standards and no environmental standards. Minnesota in this bill will build a clean grid economy on the backs of child slaves in China and poor environmental regulations in Indonesia and the Congo.""

Igo lamented that the resources to build a clean energy future are right there in Minnesota, which leads the nation in iron ore production, but the federal government opted to ban mining in the state.

""The third-largest deposits of copper, nickel and cobalt that exist in the known world are only 250 miles north of this Capitol. Instead of investing in those resources … we have decided to export it around the world where carbon emissions will be 20, 25 or 30 times higher than if we were to do it here in Minnesota,"" Igo said.

Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland signed Public Land Order 7917, which withdraws around 225,504 acres of land in the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota from mineral leasing, according to a Jan. 26 press release.

The move drew criticism from mining associations and lawmakers who believe mining is necessary for the country's mineral security and could harm the interests of Twin Metals, a major mining company that seeks to build an underground mine in Ely, a small city in Saint Louis County, Minnesota.

Rep. Pete Stauber (R-Minn.), who represents the region where a proposed copper-nickel mine was to be set up by Twin Metals, called the Biden administration's decision ""an attack on our way of life.""

Meanwhile, National Mining Association CEO Rich Nolan said the decision is ""nonsensical"" considering that the U.S. is looking to be a ""leader in manufacturing, innovation and climate.""

According to Nolan, the government has imposed the mining moratorium at a time when the demand for minerals like nickel, cobalt and copper is ""skyrocketing"" because of their ""widespread application in solar and wind infrastructure as well as electric vehicles.""

Nolan pointed out that these lands could provide U.S. manufacturers with ""plentiful sources"" of minerals apart from providing high-paying domestic jobs. Further, the country is losing out on mining operations that would have been implemented in compliance with environmental and safety regulations.

Of course, these observations wouldn't be heeded by Biden and the Democrats. They want to flaunt their power with no regard for what is truly beneficial for the Minnesotans and Americans in general.

EN_CC_200055.txt,Other,Other,"Biden Admin Aims To Turn The World Bank Into A Climate Cash Machine: REPORT 

 President Joe Biden intends to replace outgoing World Bank president David Malpass with a candidate willing to refocus the institution on climate change activism, a longtime goal of the administration, Axios reported Thursday, citing anonymous White House advisers.

Malpass — a Trump appointee and husband to Daily Caller News Foundation president Adele Malpass — on Wednesday announced his intention to step down from his post on June 30, more than eight months before his five-year term was set to end. For his replacement, the Biden administration is seeking a diverse candidate that will reshape the World Bank, from its current focus on poverty alleviation to an institution with a broader focus on climate change goals such as reduced emissions, Axios reported. (RELATED: Trump-Appointed World Bank President Announces Resignation)

The details of Malpass’ departure had reportedly made their way to the Biden administration several weeks ago, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s statement regarding his decision coming just minutes after Malpass’ own announcement, Axios reported. Malpass has faced calls from environmentalists to resign since September, after he responded to a question about whether human burning of fossil fuels was a driver of dangerous global warming by claiming that he was not a scientist.

This afternoon, I met with the @WorldBank Group’s Board of Directors and informed them of my intention to step down by the end of our June 30 fiscal year.

It has been an honor & privilege to serve as World Bank President. I have written more on @LinkedIn: https://t.co/ZGtTjh4BpL

— David Malpass (@DavidMalpassWBG) February 15, 2023

The Biden administration had previously considered taking steps to oust Malpass from his role at the U.N.-backed World Bank following his September comments, but decided against it, in part to ensure that the U.S. would retain its informal right to name the president of the body, Axios reported. Yellen last Thursday called for the World Bank to expand its scope beyond its current focus on poverty reduction and “take decisive action on global challenges like climate change, pandemics, and conflict and fragility.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a Daily Caller News Foundation request for comment.

 Fetterman drapes himself in Israeli flag during DC rally in support of the Jewish state

Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) draped himself in an Israel flag as he joined the nearly 300,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, DC, Tuesday in support of the Jewish state as it wages war against Hamas terrorists.

The Pennsylvania Democrat was photographed at the March for Israel rally with the blue and white flag wrapped over his trademark hoodie as he greeted attendees.

Fetterman has been unequivocal in his staunch support of Israel since Hamas’ Oct. 7 terrorist attack despite facing some left-wing backlash over his stance.

“Of course I’m here, how could I not!” Fetterman told one rally-goer, according to an attendee’s X post.

A sharp-eyed X user pointed out that Fetterman used the strings on his hoodie to affix the flag to himself in “the most bipartisan act I’ve ever seen from a Senator.”

Fetterman’s fondness for the Israeli flag triggered several pro-Palestinian protesters outside the US Capitol last week, after the senator emerged from the building waving a small Star of David flag above his head as some demonstrators were being arrested.

“Shame! What a joke!” some of the booing protesters shouted as Fetterman strolled by.

In his office, the senator also displays the posters of the innocent Israelis kidnapped by Hamas terrorists during their deadly raid which also killed 1,200 people.

“They will stay up until every single person is safely returned home,” Fetterman noted in a video posted on X.

Fetterman has also argued against a cease-fire in the conflict, which has reportedly angered some of his supporters and former staffers.

“Now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. We must support Israel in efforts to eliminate the Hamas terrorists who slaughtered innocent men, women, and children,” the former lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania said in anOct. 18 post on X. “Hamas does not want peace, they want to destroy Israel. We can talk about a ceasefire after Hamas is neutralized.”

Fetterman, however, has remained a harsh critic of congressional Republican efforts to decouple US military aid for Israel from a separate aid proposal for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia’s invasion.

On Tuesday he called on his GOP colleagues in the upper chamber to cease efforts to pass a stand-alone Israel aid bill.

“Israel and Ukraine are going through existential threats. We need to send aid to BOTH, and my Republican colleagues need to cut the crap,” Fetterman wrote on X.

 West silences activists at home while promoting rights abroad – report

Democratic governments suppress protests at home but preach human rights abroad, Climate Rights International has said

Rich democratic nations are deploying harsh measures against climate change activists, while criticizing states in the Global South for similar actions, according to a report by Climate Rights International.

The report highlights the increasingly “heavy-handed treatment” of eco activists in Australia, Germany, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, the UK, and the US, emphasizing that authorities in those nations are violating their legal commitments to protect basic human rights.

According to the study, the drastic steps taken by governments in nations perceived as democratic include lengthy prison terms, preventive detention, and intimidation and harassment online and in the media.

The 70-page report entitled “On Thin Ice: Disproportionate Responses to Climate Change Protesters in Democratic Countries” also highlights how such governments criticize authorities in developing nations for not respecting the right to peaceful protest.

“Governments too often take such a strong and principled view about the right to peaceful protest in other countries – but when they don’t like certain kinds of protests at home they pass laws and deploy the police to stop them,” the executive director of Climate Rights International, Brad Adams, told The Guardian.

Judicial authorities in several countries including the UK, Germany and the US have been imposing “record-breaking” sentences for “non-violent protest,” the report said, emphasizing that some national and state governments are using preemptive arrests and detention of those suspected of planning rallies.

Governments in Western states are also adopting new laws to make the vast majority of protests illegal, and allowing more severe penalties for demonstrators, the report noted.

The researchers accused Western authorities of undermining the right to a fair trial by taking legal steps to stop juries from hearing about people’s motives for taking part in protests during court hearings.

In one UK case in July, five Just Stop Oil protesters were convicted of conspiracy to cause public nuisance by blocking a highway, and were handed the longest-ever sentences for a nonviolent protest. One of the group received a five-year sentence, while four others received four-year terms.",EN,['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities'],['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments'],west silence activist home promote right abroad report west silence activist home promote right abroad report democratic government suppress protest home preach human right abroad climate right international say rich democratic nation deploy harsh measure climate change activist criticize state global south similar action accord report climate right international report highlight increasingly heavy handed treatment eco activist australia germany france netherlands new zealand sweden uk emphasize authority nation violate legal commitment protect basic human right accord study drastic step take government nation perceive democratic include lengthy prison term preventive detention intimidation harassment online medium -page report entitle thin ice disproportionate response climate change protester democratic country highlight government criticize authority develop nation respect right peaceful protest government strong principled view right peaceful protest country don like certain kind protest home pass law deploy police stop executive director climate right international brad adams tell guardian judicial authority country include uk germany impose record break sentence non violent protest report say emphasize national state government preemptive arrest detention suspect plan rally government western state adopt new law vast majority protest illegal allow severe penalty demonstrator report note researcher accuse western authority undermine right fair trial take legal step stop jury hear people motive take protest court hearing uk case july stop oil protester convict conspiracy cause public nuisance block highway hand long sentence nonviolent protest group receive year sentence receive year term

 President Joe Biden’s economic policies are top-down big government crony capitalism predicated on the false notion that he inherited an “economic catastrophe,” Breitbart Economics Editor John Carney said in a Friday interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow.

Biden again touted his “Bidenomics” economic policies in a speech in South Carolina Thursday, arguing that his administration is building “an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not trickling down.”

Carney, however, argued that Bidenomics is actually “built on a lie.”

“First of all, it’s built on a lie because the very beginning of Bidenomics is [Biden’s claim] ‘I inherited an economic catastrophe,’ which we know isn’t true. He didn’t inherit an economic catastrophe. He inherited an economy that was growing above six percent. He inherited an economic boom. So, everything since then has been a lie.”

“We got inflation because they lied that we were in an economic catastrophe, so they overspent,” he continued. “So, of course, right now you’re thinking, ‘Why can’t I make sense of this?’ It’s because it’s just lies.”

Carney then zeroed in on Biden’s “middle out and bottom up” claim.

“Nobody I’ve talked to can explain what ‘from the bottom up and the middle out’ means at all,” he said. “And that’s also not what they’re doing. When they are having government-directed money flowing into the economy—you know, all the subsidies for the Green New Deal stuff—that’s not from the bottom up. That’s the top down.”

“It’s a grift,” Kudlow added. “It’s money to donors, campaign donors. It’s money to big corporations who buy into their DEI and climate change stuff. It’s money to Democratic interest groups city by city, state by state. You are so right. It’s totally top down.”

“It’s not working either, because the American people are rejecting it all of the time. Whenever you see polls, they say they don’t trust Biden,” Carney noted.

An AP-NORC poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans believe Biden’s economy is “poor,” and 64 percent disapprove of his management of the economy.

Carney also commented on Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department, noting that despite the numbers coming in under expectations, the report “almost guarantees two more hikes” from the Federal Reserve.

He made this same point in Friday’s Breitbart Business Digest, explaining that the June jobs report and data showing a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly wages “are likely enough to lock-in a rate hike at the end-of-the-month Federal Open Market Committee meeting and tilt the balance in favor of another rate hike in September.”

 Letters to the Editor: How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war

To the editor: I read the letters to the editor, and there is a clear divide between those who think the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should confront the aggressor, or whether that’s too likely to cause an escalation in the war.

While many people draw parallels between Hitler and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, there is one very clear difference: Putin has nukes.

Nevertheless, while nuclear annihilation is a risk of escalation, appeasement of war criminals has never tamed them. If Putin is allowed to “take” Ukraine, what is to convince him, then, that “taking” Poland is not equally attainable?

At this point, I don’t like any of the alternatives. I think limited, conventional warfare is in order, utilizing lots of conventional high-tech weaponry. The war should not be escalated beyond that, even if Russia uses chemical or biological weapons.

If the Kraken is already released, what choice do we have but to confront it?

Denys Arcuri, Indio

..

To the editor: Letter writers advocating escalating use of force by the U.S. and NATO in Ukraine illustrate how Euro-centric and frankly white-centric our global views are.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is horrific and needs to be addressed forcefully by the U.S. and its allies. But why should the U.S. and NATO engage in armed conflict in the latest global tragedy while ignoring or being responsible for much larger humanitarian disasters of the past few decades, which resulted in much higher fatalities?

Like the invasion of Ukraine, these humanitarian disasters unleashed unthinkable death and destruction on innocent people. Unlike the invasion of Ukraine, they took place in nonwhite and non-European locations.

Few Americans advocated for a global power to intercede and put an end to their suffering.

 Paranoid Putin tries to hide ‘cancer battle’ by making bombshell medical files SECRET as weak ruler fears being toppled’

PANICKED Vladimir Putin has dramatically classified bombshell data which appears to prove he has been treated for cancer.

Rumours have persistently swirled that the tyrant, 70, is ""critically ill"" - fuelled by his bloated face and trembling legs.

Bombshell spy documents leaked to The Sun appeared to confirm Putin has pancreatic cancer and early-stage Parkinson's disease.

Now the panicked Russian leader has desperately classified medical files that reveal an apparent cancer battle as he fears a coup inside the Kremlin.

A loophole previously allowed investigative journalists to show that the dictator was constantly accompanied by a top thyroid cancer specialist and other medics.

Revelations last April indicated surgeon Yevgeny Selivanov, of Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital, had flown to Putin no less than 35 times in Black Sea resort Sochi.

More on Putin

The proof of Putin’s treatment by cancer doctors was deduced from the existence of contracts with the hospital which were listed on a Russian public procurement website.

Now such details have been made top secret, preventing public knowledge of current and future contracts.

Earlier it was seen that Putin was accompanied by between six and 13 medical specialists on his trips.

Medics were also seen to be on standby near his favourite official residences outside Moscow, for example in Sochi and Valdai.

Most read in The Sun

The report by Proekt media in April gave credence to rumours that Putin had suffered from cancer.

Medics appeared to be thyroid and ENT specialists.

It comes after it was revealed the Russian government has built a secret network of rail lines that lead to Putin's residences - and train stations nearby.

The blocking of data of such contracts was revealed by Sirena, part of Radio Liberty.

KREMLIN COUP?

The move is likely to increase speculation that the Kremlin is hiding the truth about Putin’s health during the war against Ukraine.

Symptoms of thyroid cancer include the appearance of a thick nodule in the thyroid area; hoarseness of voice; difficulty swallowing; pain in the neck and throat; enlarged lymph nodes in the neck; a dry cough, scratchy or scratchy feeling in the throat or behind the sternum.

There have also been claims that Putin is suffering from abdominal cancer and other ailments.

Meanwhile, there have been suggestions that drugs to treat his cancer may have distorted his mind when he launched the war in Ukraine.

The Kremlin insists that Putin is healthy.

Among the medics named as treating Putin were Dr Dmitry Verbovoy, an expert in acute illnesses, injuries and poisonings.

Another was Dr Konstantin Sim, an orthopaedic traumatologist, possibly helping with ice hockey injuries, ENT doctor Alexei Shcheglov and infectious disease specialist Yaroslav Protasenko.

He was also seen by neurosurgeons from the Central Clinical Hospital, led by department head Oleg Myshkin and Dr Elena Rastrusina, plus a resuscitator

Dr Pavel Sharikov, and head nurse Lyudmila Kadenkova.

A rehabilitation specialist was also involved, Dr Mikhail Tsykunov.In July 2020, Putin met with the head of the National Medical Research Center for Endocrinology, Ivan Dedov.

It comes after the former head of MI6 suggested said there could be a coup inside the Kremlin to oust Putin - but the mechanisms for political change in Russia are ""fragile"".

Sir Richard Dearlove told The Sun: ""I think we're heading into another phase where you're going to get a political upheaval as a result of a war gone badly wrong.

EN_UA_300100.txt,Other,Other,"Trump Lawyer Demands Accountability From Intel Chiefs Who Backed Hunter Biden 

 An attorney for former President Donald Trump wants the 51 former intelligence chiefs held responsible for backing Hunter Biden in the unfolding story of the laptop abandoned in a Delaware repair shop.

Lawyer Tim Parlatore's goal is to uncover alleged communications between the 51 former senior intel leaders and the Biden 2020 campaign.

Politico had reported that an Oct. 19, 2020, letter, signed by the former intelligence officials, outlined their assessment that a New York Post disclosure of emails allegedly belonging to Hunter Biden ""has all the classic earmarks of a Russia information operation.""

Those signing the letter included former CIA Directors Leon Panetta, Mike Hayden and John Brennan, along with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper.

The letter offered no evidence, but raised suspicions by the former intel officials.

The Post had previously reported that during the final months of the heated 2020 presidential race between Joe Biden and Trump, there were emails showing evidence of a possible meeting in the past between Hunter Biden, his father, and a Ukrainian energy firm linked to corruption. Joe Biden denied the meeting described took place.

In March of this year, The New York Times backed up portions of the Post's reporting on the Hunter Biden emails.

""Those emails were obtained by The New York Times from a cache of files that appears to have come from a laptop abandoned by Mr. Biden in a Delaware repair shop. The email and others in the cache were authenticated by people familiar with them and with the investigation,"" the Times reported.

Now, Parlatore has filed letters of complaint with the agencies that had employed the 51 former intel officials.

The letters cite ""an egregious breach"" by former agency employees ""that appears to have been overlooked by your agency, as it has gone uninvestigated and certainly unpunished. Specifically, the unauthorized publication and dissemination of an intelligence assessment, purportedly based on classified information that was used wrongfully to influence the outcome of an election.""

According to a Post opinion piece by journalist Miranda Devine, letters were sent to John Hollister Hedley, chairman of the Publication Classification Review Board at the CIA; Gen. Paul Nakasone, director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command; Christine Abizaid, director of the National Counterterrorism Center at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; Caroline Krass, general counsel, Department of Defense; and Avril Haines, director of the Information Management Division in the Office of the DNI.

Parlatore wants each agency to ""proceed immediately with legal action to [ensure] that such breaches of vital security provisions do not continue to go unchecked, the Post said.

His letter notes that each of the 51 former officials was ""bound by the lifelong obligation"" to submit the letter to their former agencies for pre-publication security review.

Parlatore is also expected to file a letter with the Federal Election Commission asking that the letter signed by the 51 former officials be considered a campaign ""in-kind contribution.""

The Post noted that another step is for Parlatore to file a lawsuit as he seeks to establish a link between Democrat operatives and the controversial letter.

EN_CC_100203.txt,Other,Other,"IMF’s Climate Call 

 The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent call for enhanced transparency in Pakistan’s budgetary considerations for climate adaptation is timely and crucial, coinciding with the nation’s active pursuit of international support at COP28 in Dubai. As caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar leads Pakistan’s representation, transparency emerges as a cornerstone for effective policy-making and attracting climate-related financing.

The IMF’s recommendation to make the FY 2024-25 budget a turning point for climate adaptation planning underscores the imperative to integrate climate considerations into financial decisions. Seeking transparency on climate-related actions with budgetary implications aligns with the global recognition of the need to harmonise financial decisions with climate goals. This emphasis reflects an acknowledgment that fiscal sustainability analysis under diverse climate change scenarios is vital for informed decision-making.

Despite capacity constraints, the urgent call to train staff for climate initiatives underscores the necessity of investing in the nation’s ability to navigate climate challenges. Strengthening the capacity of relevant ministries, including the Ministry of Climate Change, Planning Commission, and Climate Change Authority, aligns with broader goals such as achieving National Climate Change Policy (NCCP) and National Determined Contributions (NDC) targets.

The IMF’s recommendation to publish climate-related spending for FY 2023-24, coupled with advancing green budgeting, signifies a commitment to transparency and accountability. Extending the green tracking system to all provinces, supported by the controller general of accounts, emphasises the need for a comprehensive and inclusive approach.

As part of the ongoing $3 billion standby arrangement, fulfilling the structural benchmark regarding climate public investment plans is crucial for meeting international commitments. Strengthening the appraisal process for investments and projects, including specific guidance on climate factors, ensures comparability and alignment with climate targets. The IMF’s holistic advice to adapt the entire budget formulation and approval process to climate change requirements signifies a forward-looking approach. Integrating summary information in budget papers, specifying the number and value of climate-related projects, and considering major current issues like flood recovery and projects of public interest ensures a comprehensive alignment with climate-conscious financial decisions.

The IMF’s call for enhanced transparency in Pakistan’s budgetary considerations for climate adaptation, amidst the nation’s active engagement at COP28, is pivotal for shaping a sustainable future. As Pakistan seeks international support, a commitment to transparency and climate-conscious financial decisions will play a crucial role in navigating the global shift towards sustainable practices.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],imf climate international monetary fund imf recent enhanced transparency pakistan budgetary consideration climate adaptation timely crucial coincide nation active pursuit international support cop dubai caretaker prime minister anwaarul haq kakar lead pakistan representation transparency emerge cornerstone effective policy making attract climate relate financing imf recommendation fy budget turning point climate adaptation planning underscore imperative integrate climate consideration financial decision seek transparency climate relate action budgetary implication align global recognition need harmonise financial decision climate goal emphasis reflect acknowledgment fiscal sustainability analysis diverse climate change scenario vital informed decision making despite capacity constraint urgent train staff climate initiative underscore necessity invest nation ability navigate climate challenge strengthen capacity relevant ministry include ministry climate change planning commission climate change authority align broad goal achieve national climate change policy nccp national determined contribution ndc target imf recommendation publish climate relate spending fy couple advance green budgeting signify commitment transparency accountability extend green tracking system province support controller general account emphasise need comprehensive inclusive approach ongoing billion standby arrangement fulfil structural benchmark climate public investment plan crucial meet international commitment strengthen appraisal process investment project include specific guidance climate factor ensure comparability alignment climate target imf holistic advice adapt entire budget formulation approval process climate change requirement signify forward look approach integrate summary information budget paper specify number value climate relate project consider major current issue like flood recovery project public interest ensure comprehensive alignment climate conscious financial decision imf enhanced transparency pakistan budgetary consideration climate adaptation amidst nation active engagement cop pivotal shape sustainable future pakistan seek international support commitment transparency climate conscious financial decision play crucial role navigate global shift sustainable practice

 FOOTAGE shows the moment two eco-idiots glued themselves to a dinosaur display at a German museum in front of a group of bemused visitors.

The latest daft stunt, undertaken by the 'Letzte Generation' (Last Generation) climate activist group, took place at Berlin’s National Museum this afternoon.

A video clip showed how the two women - wearing hi-vi vests - had entered the site before supergluing themselves to the giant dinosaur model.

Museumgoers were stunned as the duo pedalled rhetoric that accused the German government of failing to properly address the threat of climate change.

The stunt, which was later shared on social media, appeared to be a copycat of antics at several other sites where protesters have glued themselves to priceless pieces.

In this case it is unknown whether the model, which is held up by supportive poles, was damaged.

The latest stunt comes just days after the campaign group tarnished a £100million Clade Monet masterpiece with mashed potato.

At the time, the group admitted to being inspired by antics at the National Gallery in London earlier this month which drew global attention.

The Just Stop Oil activists - named as Anna Holland, 20, and 21-year-old Phoebe Plummer - chucked tomato soup over Van Gogh's famous Sunflowers painting.

They were arrested for criminal damage and aggravated trespass but both eco-zealots pleaded not guilty at Westminster Magistrates' Court.


Their trial date is set for December 13 at the City of London Magistrates' Court.

Meanwhile, it has since been revealed that Just Stop Oil has been paying its protesters to clog Britain's roads as the country continues to be plagued by demonstrations.

The organisation, which has repeatedly brought traffic grinding to a halt over the last few weeks, is bankrolled by the mega-rich.

This month alone, Just Stop Oil has blocked roads across England, sparking fury among motorists.

In Knightsbridge, London, the green warriors stopped a sick baby getting to hospital and a fire engine responding to blaze.

Days later, furious members of the public dragged the mob from the tarmac for preventing a van driver from visiting his ill wife.

 by Eric Zuesse, The Duran:

First here, are a group of lies that all are false, all for the very same reason — that they all blatantly contradict the actual (as is to be documented here) history (just click onto each given lying phrase below, to see instances in which the given false phrase has been reported as being instead true — and, then, I shall here document them all to be not just false but the reverse of truth, the exact opposite of the reality):

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine” (commonly used in U.S.-and-allied official Government statements).

“unprovoked war in Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

“Russian aggression against Ukraine” (two typical examples using it are this and this).

Any alleged report that employs any such phrase is propaganda — lying ‘news’ or ‘history’ — that bases itself upon the false unstated assumption that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 started the war in Ukraine, instead of responded to a war in Ukraine that U.S. President Barack Obama’s Administration (including Joe Biden) — the American Government — had actually started there, in 2014, against Ukraine’s adjoining nation of Russia. America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).

Here, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:

The Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.

For the full details, see this.

So: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).

The war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).

America’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.

 TRUMP SAYS: HUNTER MAKES FORTUNE FROM SHADY DEALS!

BIDEN FAMILY STINKS TO HIGH HEAVENS OF CORRUPTION!

DON'T GET LEFT OUT: HUNTER MUST BE STOPPED!

Russia is mocking the United States’ insistence on funding Ukraine while in massive amounts of debt. Washington continues to throw billions of dollars into the fire of the Ukraine conflict despite its ballooning debt, Russia’s ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov has said.

The U.S. empire is becoming the laughing stock of the world over its insistence on pushing war and death for profit. Antonov made the comments after Washington approved a new tranche of aid to Kiev on the day when its debt reached a new milestone of $35 trillion.

Monday’s announcement by the Pentagon said that the U.S. will send an additional $1.7 billion in military aid to Ukraine because of an “accounting error” that somehow allows for more military spending. The ruling class can’t solve the inflation problem, but they can always find funding for war.

The Ruling Class, Now $35 Trillion In Debt, Finds Another $2 Billion For Ukraine

”Washington continues to burn colossal money in the furnace of the Ukraine conflict, and it does so in the face of record levels of US government debt,” the diplomat told journalists. “One can only imagine what good the resources pumped into the neo-Nazi and terrorist Kiev regime would do if they were spent on peaceful needs, on development, and on addressing the multiple social and economic issues” at home, mused Antonov.

Stop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War

Russia has also said that American weapons are not capable of turning around the situation on the battlefield and will only prolong the conflict and lead to more casualties, including among civilians. Historically, the U.S. hasn’t much cared about how many deaths result from its war mongering, as long as war is ongoing. It’s important to note that this is the disturbing reality of the ruling class we are being subjugated by.

EN_UA_300036.txt,Other,Other,"US to Help Ukraine Print School Textbooks as Russia War Disrupts Printing Houses 

 The United States plans to pick up the slack in producing elementary school textbooks in Ukraine as the country’s printing industry continues to suffer in the war with Russia.

“Russia is waging a war not just against the Ukrainian military, but also against the Ukrainian people,” White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in a June 24 statement.

Mr. Sullivan said some of these Russian attacks have manifested in the form of strikes targeting printing presses throughout Ukraine, including the Faktor-Druk printing house in Kharkiv, which he described as one of the largest printing houses in all of Europe. The Kharkiv region in northeastern Ukraine has been a focal point for renewed fighting in recent weeks.

“Kharkiv’s printing houses produce a significant percentage of all books in Ukraine, including textbooks for Ukrainian children. By striking these printing houses, Russia is attacking Ukraine’s education system. We will not let Russia succeed,” Mr. Sullivan said.

The White House official said the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) will assist Ukraine in printing more than 3 million textbooks for elementary school students in the country ahead of the next school year. Mr. Sullivan said this textbook production effort will take place inside Ukraine and that the finished books will be distributed to more than 12,000 schools around the country.

“Our message is clear: We will continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they defend against Russia’s barbaric war of aggression,” Mr. Sullivan said.

He didn’t specify how much the textbook production run would cost, from where USAID would draw the funds, or where the new production efforts would take place to avoid additional disruptions from Russian attacks. The Epoch Times reached out to both the White House and USAID for further comment but didn’t receive a response from either by press time.

The U.S. government has designated some $173 billion for direct and indirect aid to Ukraine since Russian forces launched their large-scale military campaign there in February 2022, most recently allocating about $60 billion for Ukraine in a foreign aid supplemental that Congress passed in April. While much of the U.S. support for Ukraine has been in the form of shipments of weapons, ammunition, and other military equipment to assist in the fighting, Ukraine also has received humanitarian aid and direct financial support.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],help ukraine print school textbook russia war disrupt print house united states plan pick slack produce elementary school textbook ukraine country printing industry continue suffer war russia russia wage war ukrainian military ukrainian people white house national security adviser jake sullivan say june statement mr sullivan say russian attack manifest form strike target print press ukraine include faktor druk printing house kharkiv describe large printing house europe kharkiv region northeastern ukraine focal point renew fighting recent week kharkiv print house produce significant percentage book ukraine include textbook ukrainian child strike printing house russia attack ukraine education system let russia succeed mr sullivan say white house official say u.s agency international development usaid assist ukraine print million textbook elementary school student country ahead school year mr sullivan say textbook production effort place inside ukraine finished book distribute school country message clear continue stand ukrainian people defend russia barbaric war aggression mr sullivan say didn specify textbook production run cost usaid draw fund new production effort place avoid additional disruption russian attack epoch time reach white house usaid comment didn receive response press time u.s government designate billion direct indirect aid ukraine russian force launch large scale military campaign february recently allocate billion ukraine foreign aid supplemental congress pass april u.s support ukraine form shipment weapon ammunition military equipment assist fighting ukraine receive humanitarian aid direct financial support

It was always going to be a balancing act keeping the credibility of the global environmental talk shop COP28 in check while holding it in a country where they are producing fossil fuels like it is going out of fashion. It might not have been a wise choice of the UAE’s president Mohamed Bin Zaid to give the top job of presiding over the event to the oil minister and the boss of the national oil company, but it was equally unwise for Sultan al-Jabar to have used the event as a way of promoting the UAE and its oil production to other countries. Something about that smacks of shooting yourself in the foot and perhaps Mr Al Jabar’s denials and feigned innocence at the opening day press conference just made the whole fiasco even more of a farce than it already was.

The UAE tycoon just lowered himself into the vat of sulphuric acid when – in media terms – he couldn’t pull off the ultimate stunt that all politicians dream of but very few actually achieve: to lie to the press and get away with it.

Lazy journalists might have just left it at that. But then they started to look more closely at Mr Al Jaber who had paid Lynton Cosby, the infamous Australian media and political consultant to handle all the PR for the event – and decided that the Emirate minister’s unchecked, feral speaking needed a closer look. It didn’t take much digging to find even more controversy days earlier when he more or less mocked the science behind climate change in defence of fossil fuels, leading many to ask how did the UAE get this gig in the first place and couldn’t its elite have chosen someone with more media elan?

The failure of the event can really be determined by how media were mismanaged from the beginning when the early signs were there back in January when the Guardian launched its first attack against Mr Al Jaber questioning his credentials. That might have been a good indicator that Jaber and his team needed to listen and learn with a serious of crisis management media training sessions which Mr Cosby should have set up and wheeled in the grey haired retired journalists in London to help with the dummy interviews. But presumably, being someone who has enjoyed silencing the press – the UAE has probably one of the most servile press in the world, often with media outlets running front page stories about the elite opening a shopping mall or just repeating one of their tweets – it was little surprise that Jaber believed that the world’s press wouldn’t turn against him. The old story that when you mess up media, you become the story, became the story. Jaber, within a matter of hours, became the focus of attention by journalists who were the to find a good story and didn’t find one from the organised conferences and hullabaloo.

The UAE needs to think much more about international media if it is going to court the attention of the world. Its elite need to wake up and realise that international press whose journalists fly in and leave a few days later are working from a very different hymn sheet than the local expats who work for The National, which despite huffing and puffing and blowing hot for Jaber right from the beginning made no impact whatsoever on global opinion which has written off the event as an unprecedented PR disaster. Indeed, it was Yanis Varoufakis, a media darling and former Greek Finance minister who put it so succinctly on Twitter:

“UN Chief denounces COP28’s President. What did they expect? Appointing Sultan al-Jaber, the head of UAE’s oil company, as Head of COP28 was like appointing the leader of a pack of wolves to preside over a conference on making the world vegan”. The UAE doesn’t have a satire magazine like Private Eye so we won’t pity those who were robbed of the opportunity to lay on the irony hard and thick. But the lessons are there for the royals of the UAE who must be dumbfounded by the calamity of the event and just how much the whole event has become an international laughing stock. Perhaps think about media more next time?

 Glaciers Give the Lie to Global Warming Narrative

According to the Gospel of the Global Warming Hoax, 1850–1910 was the coldest period of the past millennium. Yet glaciers were retreating rapidly. Now that the planet allegedly has a fever, the retreat has slowed dramatically and even reversed:

Our moonbat rulers canceled the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age for failing to comply with climate ideology. But preventing glaciers from growing is more difficult than doctoring the historical record to support climate con man Michael Mann’s spurious hockey stick graph.

Nonetheless, prophet of doom Al Gore shouts that “we could lose our capacity for self-governance” if we don’t surrender still more freedom to Big Government so that it can fix the supposedly broken weather.

EN_CC_300179.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"‘Disastrous’ flood warning in California as another storm hits 

 LOS ANGELES: Disastrous flooding could hit parts of California this weekend, forecasters warned Friday, as the eighth storm in succession barreled in over land already too waterlogged to soak up any more rain. The most populous US state has been pummeled by near-record downpours over a very wet three weeks, which have already caused flooding, landslides and widespread power outages. At least 19 people are known to have died as communities struggle to cope with the constant deluge.

On Friday yet another system moved in, with forecasters warning the Monterey Peninsula could be cut off and the whole city of Salinas-home to 160,000 people-flooded. ""The entire lower Salinas Valley will have disastrous flooding,"" the National Weather Service said.

""The entire city of Salinas is in danger of flooding. Most of Castroville will flood. All roads near the Salinas River will be flooded and impassable. 90,000 acres or more of agricultural land in the Salinas Valley will have disastrous flooding. ""Many roads, homes and agricultural land areas in the Salinas Valley will have major flood damage."" The Salinas River, already swollen by weeks of torrential rain, was expected to peak some time Friday, breaching its banks in a flood that could last until Sunday.

Kelley O'Connell said the bursting of a levee near her home had worried her. ""If they release water from the dams or we get more rain, we're just a field away,"" she told the San Francisco Chronicle as she collected sandbags.

Evacuation orders and warnings were widespread, with forecasters saying major roads could become impassable-including highways that link the Monterey Peninsula with the rest of the county. ""Residents both on the peninsula and in the Salinas area should expect to be cut off for two to three days,"" Monterey County officials said earlier this week.

Monterey County Sheriff Tina Nieto told reporters Thursday that floodwater could strand people. ""This is a slow-moving event"" and not all places will be impacted at once, she said. ""The river crests at different times.""

Resident John Guru said he was taking no chances, with four days' supplies at home and two days' worth in his car in case he is caught out on the road. ""I'm not sure how bad it's going to be,"" he told the Monterey Herald. ""I will find a place if needed and do whatever it takes,"" he said, adding: ""This is crazy, I was not anticipating anything like this.""

Snow

Workers have rushed out in between storms to clear up some of the mess left behind, shoveling mud from roads even in the heart of Los Angeles. Crews have cut up felled trees, and heavy machinery have been drafted in to move rockslides.

Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses have been left without power at various times-sometimes repeatedly-as rickety infrastructure has taken a battering. And it's not over yet, forecasters say. ""The ongoing unsettled weather in the West associated with the active Atmospheric River pattern unfortunately continues into this weekend with another couple rounds of heavy precipitation forecast,"" the NWS said.

Over the mountains, that precipitation was falling as snow, with more than three feet (a meter) expected in the Sierra Nevada range, making travel dangerous or impossible, even as thousands of skiers and snowboarders head for fresh powder over the Martin Luther King, Jr Day holiday weekend.

Among those who have died in the last three weeks were drivers who were found in submerged cars, people struck by falling trees, a husband and wife killed in a rockfall, and people whose bodies were discovered in floodwaters. Winter storms are not unusual in California, where most of the annual rain comes in a fairly concentrated period.

But global warming, driven by the industrial era's unchecked use of fossil fuels, is supercharging storms, making them wetter and wilder. At the same time, the western United States is aridifying, with much of the region in its 23rd year of drought. Hydrologists say the recent rains are helping-California has received an average of almost nine inches (23 centimeters) of rain since late December-but are not a fix. ""A few weeks of storms is not enough in this drought for California, but it certainly is nice. It's certainly making a good dent,"" Jay Lund, director of University of California, Davis, told the Chronicle.

This is a war between democracy and autocracy.

While I agree that Russia is an autocracy, Ukraine is also an autocracy. Zelensky has banned his opposition, shutdown independent media and arrested and tortured his political opponents.

The world’s autocracies include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, the Baltic states, Slovakia, Greece, Germany and the United Kingdom. Germany is one of the world’s leading police states and still uses the same Gestapo and Stasi tactics to crush its dissidents. The United States under Joe Biden is trending toward autocracy due to draconian censorship of social media and the expansion of the surveillance state and is only thwarted from moving further in that direction by the U.S. Constitution.

The difference between British autocracy and Russian autocracy is that you can be arrested and imprisoned in the UK for “misgendering” someone on Twitter.

EN_CC_200349.txt,Other,Other,"Great Barrier Reef Doomsday Claims Should Be Audited: Scientist 

 Australian geo-physicist Peter Ridd says an additional $5 million (US$3.3 million) allocated to the Great Barrier Reef in this week’s budget would be better spent on “genuine environmental problems.”

The funding was handed down as part of Labor’s 2024 federal budget on May 14.

In a statement released last month, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation said the reef had suffered through the “worst summer” on record, with cyclones, severe flooding, starfish outbreaks and mass bleaching.

The funds will help the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to engage tourism operators undertaking reef monitoring, protection, and stewardship.

The Great Barrier Reef Foundation says the full extent of mass bleaching is not known, but claims aerial surveys over 1,000 reefs showed a rate of 73 percent bleaching within the area, plus another 6 percent in the Torres Strait.

Reef Subject to Constant ‘Doom-News’: RiddYet Mr. Ridd, a researcher into the Reef, believes its poor health has been greatly exaggerated.

“It is telling that in the latest doom-news about the Great Barrier Reef bleaching, they failed to mention that the Great Barrier Reef had record amounts of coral in 2022/23 despite having suffered four ‘catastrophic’ bleaching events in 2016, 17, 20, and 22,” he told The Epoch Times in an email.

“We ended up with twice as much coral than in 2012 when a couple of cyclones genuinely destroyed a lot of coral.

“How did we end up with so much coral if those last four bleaching event were so catastrophic—even the fast-growing coral takes five to 10 years to regrow.”

The coral that bounced back, he says, is the type most susceptible to water bleaching.

“That proves the last four bleaching events were exaggerated in terms of the coral death, and there is no reason to expect this latest event to be much different,” he said.

Minister Says Jobs and Reef Depend on FundingFederal Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek announced earlier this month that the government would also fund $17.48 million in local council projects to protect the Reef.

“We are committed to protecting our precious Great Barrier Reef and supporting the 64,000 jobs that depend on it,” she said in a statement.

“Protecting and restoring the Great Barrier Reef requires all levels of government and communities to work together.”

But Mr. Ridd says there’s evidence the Reef is thriving.

“The latest $5 million in the budget is just a drop in a bucket of how much cash is wasted ’saving' the Great Barrier Reef, which is actually one of the most pristine ecosystems on the planet,” he said.

“I estimate about $400 million are spent each year—and that is almost all wasted. We'd be better off spending it on genuine environmental problems.”

Mr. Ridd said the money could be used to audit the claims of widespread reef destruction.

“In the Great Barrier Reef science institutions there is a great deal of groupthink, emotion, and raw self-interest to maintain the fiction that the Great Barrier Reef is in grave danger,” he said.

“Dissenters are excluded and removed. The institutions need to be challenged by an official scientific ’red-team.’

“The cash could also be well spent on a publicity campaign pointing out the good condition on the reef. The recurring bad news and exaggeration is very bad for the Great Barrier Reef tourist industry.”

The March 2022–23 budget allocated a $1 billion funding package over nine years to help maintain the reef.

A spokesperson for the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water said a wide range of funding had been put in place to protect and maintain the World Heritage listed site.

“The Australian government has committed record funding of $1.2 billion in the Great Barrier Reef through to 2030, including an extra $5 million to extend the Tourism Reef Protection Initiative, so tourism operators on the Great Barrier Reef can continue to play a key role in protecting this precious area,” a spokesperson told The Epoch Times.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],great barrier reef doomsday claim audit scientist australian geo physicist peter ridd say additional million us$. million allocate great barrier reef week budget well spend genuine environmental problem funding hand labor federal budget statement release month great barrier reef foundation say reef suffer bad summer record cyclone severe flooding starfish outbreak mass bleaching fund help great barrier reef marine park authority engage tourism operator undertake reef monitoring protection stewardship great barrier reef foundation say extent mass bleaching know claim aerial survey reef show rate percent bleach area plus percent torre strait reef subject constant doom news riddyet mr ridd researcher reef believe poor health greatly exaggerated tell late doom news great barrier reef bleaching fail mention great barrier reef record amount coral despite having suffer catastrophic bleaching event tell epoch time email end twice coral couple cyclone genuinely destroy lot coral end coral bleaching event catastrophic fast grow coral take year regrow coral bounce say type susceptible water bleaching prove bleach event exaggerate term coral death reason expect late event different say minister say job reef depend fundingfederal environment minister tanya plibersek announce early month government fund million local council project protect reef committed protect precious great barrier reef support job depend say statement protect restore great barrier reef require level government community work mr ridd say evidence reef thrive late million budget drop bucket cash waste saving great barrier reef actually pristine ecosystem planet say estimate million spend year waste well spend genuine environmental problem mr ridd say money audit claim widespread reef destruction great barrier reef science institution great deal groupthink emotion raw self interest maintain fiction great barrier reef grave danger say dissenter exclude remove institution need challenge official scientific red team cash spend publicity campaign point good condition reef recur bad news exaggeration bad great barrier reef tourist industry march budget allocate billion funding package year help maintain reef spokesperson department climate change energy environment water say wide range funding place protect maintain world heritage list site australian government commit record funding billion great barrier reef include extra million extend tourism reef protection initiative tourism operator great barrier reef continue play key role protect precious area spokesperson tell epoch time

 OXFORD RESIDENTS MOUNT RESISTANCE AGAINST THE SECTIONING OF THEIR STREETS

THE GREAT CLIMATE CON

Oxford residents are taking matters into their own hands and destroying the street zone sectioning barriers.

Oxford is going to be the centre of the resistance to the climate change madness in the UK.

.

Just recently there was a day of action by activists to kick start the year of fighting back. We predicted the UK was just getting started with their resistance, and here we have it. Taking matters into their own hands, Oxford residents are destroying street zoning barriers.

Now that’s quite beautiful to see.

Further action

There are further planned dates for activists to take to the streets in various forms of protest.

Piers Corbyn and friends are taking to the streets on Friday the 13th of January., Starting at Southwark tube in London.

Then an event which has potential to draw a large crowd with reports coming in people are making the trip down from as far as Manchester is taking place in Oxford on the 18th of February.

It’s very inspiring to see the people of the UK take matters into their own hands. This year is looking to be jam packed with resistance to The Climate Con. Continued coverage will be given on our website, newsletter and social media. Stay tuned for a disobedient 2023.

 FT: Kiev will call for peace even if Trump loses the election

LONDON, August 14th. /tass/. The West will put pressure on Kiev, calling for an end to the conflict, even if US presidential candidate Donald Trump loses the election. This was reported by the Financial Times (FT) newspaper.

According to her, Kiev knows that it will be under increasing pressure to achieve negotiations on ending the conflict. And this will happen regardless of whether Trump wins the election, the publication emphasizes.

The former US president has repeatedly stated that he is able to achieve peace in Ukraine overnight, but did not specify exactly how. But several of his former officials and advisers have suggested that this could include an unofficial cession of territory in exchange for meaningful Western security guarantees for Kiev, writes FT.

Ukraine and several of its European allies are concerned about this course of events, but with the current level of Western military support and internal mobilization of Ukraine's resources, Kiev has no viable path to victory, the publication emphasizes. Europe has no desire to step up its efforts. Although the Europeans ""recognize"" that more will have to be done to arm Ukraine, ""there is no substantive discussion of options,"" the FT quoted a senior European official as saying.

On June 14, Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting with the leadership of the Foreign Ministry, named the conditions for resolving the situation in Ukraine. Among them are the withdrawal of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU) from Donbass and Novorossiya, Kiev's refusal to join NATO. In addition, Russia considers it necessary to lift all Western sanctions against it and establish Ukraine's non-aligned and nuclear-free status. Kiev rejected the Russian peace plan. After the massive attack by the Ukrainian Armed Forces on the Kursk region, which began on August 6, the Russian leader said that negotiations with the government attacking civilians were pointless.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other']",ft kiev peace trump lose election ft kiev peace trump lose election london august th /tass/. west pressure kiev call end conflict presidential candidate donald trump lose election report financial time ft newspaper accord kiev know increase pressure achieve negotiation end conflict happen regardless trump win election publication emphasize president repeatedly state able achieve peace ukraine overnight specify exactly official adviser suggest include unofficial cession territory exchange meaningful western security guarantee kiev write ft ukraine european ally concern course event current level western military support internal mobilization ukraine resource kiev viable path victory publication emphasize europe desire step effort europeans recognize arm ukraine substantive discussion option ft quote senior european official say june russian president vladimir putin meeting leadership foreign ministry name condition resolve situation ukraine withdrawal armed force ukraine afu donbass novorossiya kiev refusal join nato addition russia consider necessary lift western sanction establish ukraine non aligned nuclear free status kiev reject russian peace plan massive attack ukrainian armed force kursk region begin august russian leader say negotiation government attack civilian pointless

 In an announcement, James revealed that she filed a lawsuit against meat producer JBS USA Food Company, the American division of JBS Foods. According to James, officials at JBS are ""misleading the public"" about the environmental impact of the company's operations.

JBS says it will ""achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040"" while still implementing plans to ""increase production."" In James' view, this means that JBS will increase its carbon footprint over the next 16 years.

""As families continue to face the daily impacts of the climate crisis, they are willing to spend more of their hard-earned money on products from brands that are better for the environment,"" James commented about the case.

""When companies falsely advertise their commitment to sustainability, they are misleading consumers and endangering our planet.""

According to James, JBS is engaging in ""greenwashing"" tactics with its net zero claims. In her opinion, JBS is exploiting the pocketbooks of everyday Americans with a false promise of ""a healthy planet for future generations.""

James reassured the public that her office ""will always ensure that companies do not abuse the environment and the trust of hardworking consumers for profit.""

(Related: Last year, Letitia James launched a state-approved terror campaign against Christians in New York.)

Conveniently timed with James' lawsuit is an announcement about the latest advancements in lab-produced synthetic meat, which now costs 90 percent less to manufacture.

So-called ""cellular agriculture,"" or the growing of fake meat in a lab, will challenge the real meat industry that James and other climate crusaders are trying to destroy. Does James have financial ties to the synthetic meat industry?

""Until now, growth factors had to be added to the surrounding liquid, or media,"" reported SciTechDaily about how bovine muscle cells can now produce their own growth factors thanks to technological developments from David Kaplan, a professor at the Tufts University Center for Cellular Agriculture (TUCCA).

""Made from recombinant (genetically engineered) protein and sold by industrial suppliers, growth factors contribute to a majority of the cost of production for cultivated meat (up to or above 90%). Since the growth factors don’t last long in the cell culture media, they also have to be replenished every few days. This limits the ability to provide an affordable product to consumers. Taking that ingredient out of the growth media leads to an enormous cost savings.""

In other words, the real beef industry is being attacked on all sides with mysterious fires and lawsuits while the emerging synthetic beef industry is making major strides in reducing production costs. Can you say conspiracy?

""It just so happens as a matter of splendid serendipity that billionaire-funded lab-meat startups ramping up production coincides with the forced elimination via legal fiat of actual beef production by their minions who control DA offices from coast to coast,"" is how independent journalist Ben Bartee put it.

In the comments, someone wrote that this is clearly not a coincidence as ""their plans,"" referring to the powers that be, ""should be plain as the nose on a normie's face ... Operative words: should be.""

""Franken-farming, AI drone-operated farmerless farms, synthetic food, and the 'China Model,'"" wrote another about the takeover of food by evil, also citing this article by researcher Sandi Adams.

 INCREDIBLE footage shows a panicked Russian pilot ejecting from his plane and watching as it crashes in a fireball after being shot down.

The explosion could be seen miles away after the jet was taken down by what is thought to be Ukrainian fire.

The fighter pilot had to release his parachute mid-air and was forced to land in an abandoned field.

The shocking first-person footage is believed to have been recorded in the summer but wasn't released until now.

It shows the Russian fighter pilot release his parachute mid-air after his Su-25SM was taken down by what's believed to have been incoming Ukrainian fire, according to a weapons tracking account on Twitter.

The aircraft nose-dives into the ground, unleashing a hellish explosion that can be seen from miles away while the pilot lands safety in an abandoned field.

It is unclear what happened to the pilot since the recording but some observers claim the flight crashed during a planned training run in Belgorod region, Russia.

It comes as astonishing footage shows the moment a Ukrainian tank opened fire in a vicious battle against Russian forces.

Fierce fighting can be seen in the video as the 46-tonne T-84 main battle tank blasts its 125mm cannon towards Putin's men during the bloody clash that is understood to have occurred near Kherson.

Ukrainian forces are seen engaging nearly point-blank with a Russian convoy who appear to have blundered into them as they drove up a dirt road.

Trucks emblazoned with the ""Z"" symbol can see attempting to rush past the tank - only for soldiers on the ground to then open fire on them.

The bearded gunner in the tank's turret ducks down as gunfire can be heard all around him.

With the snaps of bullets and the boom of tank guns, the convoy - with a truck towing a howitzer and an armoured personnel carrier - grind to a halt.

Other clips released as part of the video package shows the gunner opening fire on unseen foes with his heavy machine gun.

It's believed Mad Vlad would happily sacrifice 20 million soldiers to ensure he won the war in Ukraine and secure his future as Russia's leader, a former insider has claimed.

The chilling warning comes as fears of the war in Ukraine turning nuclear continue to grow as Russia's defence minister said a ""dirty bomb"" could be detonated in Ukraine.

Exiled former diplomat Boris Bondarev warned Putin would sacrifice millions of lives to win in Ukraine.

""He is not smart, he is just lucky. Now I think his luck is over,"" Mr Bondarev told Sky News.

""You should have no doubt about it, he may sacrifice 10 or 20 million Russians just to win this war just to slaughter all Ukrainians because it's a matter of principle.

""It's a matter of political survival to him. You have to understand that, if he loses the war, it will be the end for him.""

Bondarev added: ""After losing the war, he will have to explain to his elites and his population why it is so and he may find some problems in explaining this.

""And after that there may be opposition who will try to depose him or he will try to purge his subordinates to find some people who could be blamed for all these problems.""

Meanwhile, Russian war boss Sergei Shoigu warned that the brutal warzone is risking ""uncontrolled escalation"" as Putin's forces continue to be pushed back across the frontline.

Shoigu suggested that Ukraine could actually be the one to detonate a ""dirty bomb"" - an explosive laced with radioactive material.

And while not a true nuclear weapon, the consequences of using such a device could be catastrophic.

But it has been Russia wildly swinging the nuclear sabre during the war - and the latest allegation could be another diversion tactic.

Putin's forces like to spread as much chaos and misinformation as possible to cover their own tracks.

 MOSCOW—Russia said on Sunday that the United States was responsible for a Ukrainian attack on Crimean peninsula with five U.S.–supplied missiles that killed four people, including two children, and injured 151 more.

The Russian Defence Ministry said four of the U.S.–delivered Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) missiles, equipped with cluster warheads, were shot down by air defense systems and the ammunition of a fifth had detonated in mid-air.

Footage on Russian state television showed people running from a beach and some people being carried off on sun loungers.

Russian authorities in Crimea said missile fragments had fallen just after noon near a beach on the north side of the city of Sevastopol where locals were on holiday.

The incident generated a furious reaction among Russian public figures.

The Defense Ministry said U.S. specialists had set the missiles’ flight coordinates on the basis of information from U.S. spy satellites, meaning Washington was directly responsible.

“Responsibility for the deliberate missile attack on the civilians of Sevastopol is borne above all by Washington, which supplied these weapons to Ukraine, and by the Kyiv regime, from whose territory this strike was carried out,” the ministry said.

Russia sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

The United States began supplying Ukraine with longer range ATACMS missiles, which have a 300-kilometre (186-mile) range, earlier this year.

Treating the InjuredSevastopol Governor Mihail Razvozhaev put the death toll at four, with 144 injured, including 82 taken to hospitals. Twenty-seven children were among the injured.

Specialist doctors were being flown in from other parts of Russia.

Russia will respond to Sunday’s attack, the Defense Ministry said, without elaborating. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been “in constant contact with the military” since the attack.

Dmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Security Council, described the incident as “a vile, despicable act against our people.”

He likened it to attacks carried out by gunmen on Sunday against a synagogue, a church, and police post in Dagestan and said there was “no difference to us” between the U.S. administration, Ukrainian leaders, and “crazy fanatics.”

Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill said there “was no justification whatsoever for a missile strike on civilians” and expressed indignation that the incident occurred on the Orthodox holiday of Trinity.

Neither Ukraine nor the United States has commented on the attack, which came on a day when Ukraine said one person had been killed and 10 others wounded by Russian strikes on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.",EN,"['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: UA is anti-RU extremists', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",russia say responsible deadly ukrainian attack crimea moscow russia say sunday united states responsible ukrainian attack crimean peninsula u.s supply missile kill people include child injure russian defence ministry say u.s deliver army tactical missile system atacms missile equip cluster warhead shoot air defense system ammunition fifth detonate mid air footage russian state television show people run beach people carry sun lounger russian authority crimea say missile fragment fall noon near beach north city sevastopol local holiday incident generate furious reaction russian public figure defense ministry say u.s specialist set missile flight coordinate basis information u.s spy satellite mean washington directly responsible responsibility deliberate missile attack civilian sevastopol bear washington supply weapon ukraine kyiv regime territory strike carry ministry say russia send troop ukraine feb united states begin supply ukraine long range atacms missile -kilometre -mile range early year treat injuredsevastopol governor mihail razvozhaev death toll injure include take hospital seven child injured specialist doctor fly part russia russia respond sunday attack defense ministry say elaborate kremlin say president vladimir putin constant contact military attack dmitry medvedev deputy chairman security council describe incident vile despicable act people liken attack carry gunman sunday synagogue church police post dagestan say difference u.s administration ukrainian leader crazy fanatic russian orthodox patriarch kirill say justification whatsoever missile strike civilian express indignation incident occur orthodox holiday trinity ukraine united states comment attack come day ukraine say person kill wound russian strike eastern ukrainian city kharkiv

 The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Special Representative to the Holy See and Director of the Anglican Centre in Rome, Archbishop Ian Ernest has lauded the Church of Pakistan’s efforts to promote interfaith relations in the country as well as initiating action on the environmental challenges in line with the Lambeth Calls for climate action.

Archbishop Ernest arrived in Pakistan on February 2 on a three-day on the invitation of Church of Pakistan’s President Bishop Dr Azad Marshall. During the visit, the senior church leader held various interactions with faith leaders and community members. He also visited Jaranwala to express solidarity with the victims of the August 16, 2023, violent attacks on multiple churches and homes of Christians.

Speaking to a gathering of interfaith leaders at the Saint Peter’s High School of the Diocese of Raiwand, Archbishop Ernest noted the cordial relations between the clergy of the majority Muslim community and leaders of other faiths. He stressed on the need for continued engagement between the various faith groups for promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence in society.

“It’s encouraging to see such good interfaith relations, which can also contribute greatly towards our common goal of protecting our environment,” said Archbishop Ernest.

The visiting dignitary was awarded a shield by Muslim faith leaders, including former special assistant to the prime minister on interfaith harmony Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi.

The archbishop also participated in a special meeting on climate action organised by the moderator bishop of the Church of Pakistan on Feb 4.

Addressing the participants, Archbishop Ernest lauded the Church of Pakistan’s initiative on climate action, saying he was impressed by the realisation in the church for collaborating with ecumenical partners and faith-based institutions to bring about the much-needed change by raising awareness and collective action.

“I think it’s a God given opportunity for us to be able to change the mentality of our people and to bring about the values of the Kingdom where respect for God’s creation and respect for the other are of crucial importance. Without respecting what God has given us so freely, it would be difficult for us to be instruments of grace in the world,” he said.

Earlier, Bishop Marshall briefed the meeting about the church’s initiatives for fostering partnerships to meet the environmental challenges.

He stressed on inculcating the spirit of stewardship, as embodied by the wisdom of the Christian tradition, to change the mindset towards the natural world.

“Though Pakistan is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, it is unfortunate that our country is also the least funded to effectively combat the crisis.

“We need to act together to protect, restore and safeguard the environment for ourselves and for our future generations,” he emphasised.

Archbishop Ernest and bishops of all dioceses of the Church of Pakistan also participated in the soft-launch of Bishop Marshall’s book titled “The Calling of Lent” at the Lahore College of Theology.

The messages of Archbishop of Canterbury Rt Revd Justin Welby and Anglican Communion’s Secretary General Rt Revd Bishop Anthony Poggo were also shared on the occasion.

In his message, Archbishop Welby said, “Archbishop Azad has taken considerable care to explore some of the spiritual disciplines which might help people journey more closely with Christ to the Cross and prepare for the celebrations of Easter.”

Bishop Poggo, who has written the foreword of the book, stated: “As you study this book during Lent, do please reflect upon the passion of Jesus. Lent is also a season whereby we acknowledge our need for repentance, mercy and forgiveness which is the essence of the message of Jesus Christ’s suffering on the cross.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],anglican archbishop laud pakistani church effort climate action interfaith harmony archbishop canterbury special representative holy director anglican centre rome archbishop ian ernest laud church pakistan effort promote interfaith relation country initiate action environmental challenge line lambeth call climate action archbishop ernest arrive pakistan february day invitation church pakistan president bishop dr azad marshall visit senior church leader hold interaction faith leader community member visit jaranwala express solidarity victim august violent attack multiple church home christians speak gathering interfaith leader saint peter high school diocese raiwand archbishop ernest note cordial relation clergy majority muslim community leader faith stress need continue engagement faith group promote harmony peaceful coexistence society encouraging good interfaith relation contribute greatly common goal protect environment say archbishop ernest visit dignitary award shield muslim faith leader include special assistant prime minister interfaith harmony hafiz tahir mahmood ashrafi archbishop participate special meeting climate action organise moderator bishop church pakistan feb address participant archbishop ernest laud church pakistan initiative climate action say impress realisation church collaborate ecumenical partner faith base institution bring need change raise awareness collective action think god give opportunity able change mentality people bring value kingdom respect god creation respect crucial importance respect god give freely difficult instrument grace world say early bishop marshall brief meeting church initiative foster partnership meet environmental challenge stress inculcate spirit stewardship embody wisdom christian tradition change mindset natural world pakistan climate vulnerable country world unfortunate country fund effectively combat crisis need act protect restore safeguard environment future generation emphasise archbishop ernest bishop diocese church pakistan participate soft launch bishop marshall book title calling lent lahore college theology message archbishop canterbury rt revd justin welby anglican communion secretary general rt revd bishop anthony poggo share occasion message archbishop welby say archbishop azad take considerable care explore spiritual discipline help people journey closely christ cross prepare celebration easter bishop poggo write foreword book state study book lent reflect passion jesus lent season acknowledge need repentance mercy forgiveness essence message jesus christ suffer cross

 by Jeff Crouere, The Liberty Daily:

The world is in total chaos after 39 months of the Biden presidency. The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.

These “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

There has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”

Last year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.

China is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.

Ukraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.

On October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.

As Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?

To further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.

To retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.

As the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats. In an interview on their state TV network, Iranian Major General Mohammad Bagheri said, “Our response will be much larger than tonight’s military action if Israel retaliates against Iran.”

It is being widely reported by Axios, CNN, and other media outlets that President Joe Biden is urging Netanyahu not to respond and, if he does, the United States will not be involved. This response is disturbing to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who believes the world is witnessing the most dangerous period for the Middle East since 1973. He said, “What I don’t understand is why Joe Biden and the administration would leak to the media the contents of a conversation in which he tells Netanyahu he doesn’t think that Netanyahu should respond at all. It is the continuing part of the public game they are playing which frankly encourages Iran and Hezbollah.”

Biden has also encouraged Iran by relaxing our economic sanctions, which allowed additional oil revenue to flow into their coffers. This led to their renewed financial support for terrorist organizations like Hamas. Without Iran’s generous backing, Hamas would not have been able to launch their deadly October 7 attack against Israel.

Not content to allow Iran to prosper from oil sales, Biden also released $16 billion in funds for Iran, partially for the return of six American hostages. Terror regimes should never be rewarded for taking hostages, but this is exactly what happened by the Biden administration’s unwise decision.

As the world deals with multiple international wars and unprecedented chaos in the Middle East, it is useful to remember what was happening when Donald Trump was our President.

EN_UA_103667.txt,Other,Other,"Desperation and Diplomacy: North Korea's Tech Hunt in Russia Amid Sanctions 

 For several decades, North Korea has masterfully balanced its relations with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Russia, maintaining a relationship with the latter that is both complex and ever-changing.

The dynamics have shifted notably since Russia found itself sanctioned and isolated by the international community following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Since then, North Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close, as recently seen when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited eastern Russia, where he held a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.

After a six-day visit, Mr. Kim returned to Pyongyang on Sunday.

Sanctioned by the international community, North Korea desperately needs Russian technology for nuclear weapons, satellite development, and food production.

Similarly, Russia, also facing sanctions, urgently seeks to replenish its dwindling front-line supplies with large quantities of ammunition from North Korea.

Before the summit, when asked whether Russia would assist North Korea in developing artificial satellites, Mr. Putin confirmed this was a primary reason for their meeting.

Both sides appear willing to overlook the threat of escalated international sanctions against them.

During their summit, Mr. Kim vowed to “fully and unconditionally support” Moscow.

Rocket technology holds particular interest for Mr. Kim and his regime.

From Outward Support to Clandestine CyberattacksAccording to reports, North Korea has long eyed Russian technology, resorting to cyber theft to obtain it, and it is something that Moscow now appears ready to overlook despite recent reports such as one by Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center (MTAC).

The MTAC report indicates that between March last year and this March, North Korean cyber operatives launched attacks on Russian aerospace research facilities and penetrated academic institutions engaged in research. Additionally, the operatives sent phishing emails to personnel within Russian diplomatic agencies.

The study further revealed that the countries most frequently targeted by North Korean cyberattacks during the same period included South Korea, Israel, Germany, and Russia.

The hacking groups, identified as ScarCruft and Lazarus, covertly installed digital backdoors within the company’s systems to exfiltrate sensitive information. While the full extent of the hackers’ achievements remains unclear, North Korea announced significant advancements in its ballistic missile program mere months after the cyber-attacks were initiated.

SPUTNIX, a private enterprise affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Space Research Institute, lost a substantial amount of information to these cyber incursions. The report speculates that North Korea may have stolen critical technology related to the design of ultra-small satellite bodies.

Experts suggest North Korea’s successful launches of rockets equipped with reconnaissance satellites this year likely capitalized on its prior hacking exploits. These cyber activities appear crucial in advancing the country’s space technology.

Additionally, the report disclosed that in 2020, North Korean hackers penetrated the internal network of Russia’s Almaz-Antey, a leading manufacturer of surface-to-air missiles. The intruders pilfered various information, including developer personal data and proprietary details on missile components.

In 2019, North Korean cyber operatives also exfiltrated design blueprints from Russia’s Uralvagonzavod tank factory, the entity responsible for producing Russia’s next-generation T-14 Armata battle tank.

Moreover, the report highlighted the frequency of North Korean cyber-attacks against Russian defense corporations specializing in avant-garde weapon systems like hypersonic technologies and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs).

Military commentator Xia Loshan told The Epoch Times on Sept. 10 that both North Korea and Russia are in a desperate situation.

“While North Korea is eager to acquire military technology, the ultimate decision is not in their hands,” Mr. Xia stated, emphasizing that the alliance is precarious and likely unsustainable in the face of stringent international sanctions.

Independent analyst Zhuge Mingyang also weighed in.

“In a relationship marked more by utilitarian needs than genuine alliance, both nations recognize the other’s motivations,” he told The Epoch Times.

“Moscow likely knows full well that Pyongyang is siphoning off its military technology but seems willing to turn a blind eye in exchange for much-needed ammunition—a clear example of a ‘friendship’ based on mutual expediency.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],desperation diplomacy north korea tech hunt russia amid sanction decade north korea masterfully balance relation chinese communist party ccp russia maintain relationship complex change dynamic shift notably russia find sanction isolate international community follow invasion ukraine february north korea russia grow increasingly close recently see north korean leader kim jong un visit eastern russia hold summit russian president vladimir putin week day visit mr kim return pyongyang sunday sanction international community north korea desperately need russian technology nuclear weapon satellite development food production similarly russia face sanction urgently seek replenish dwindle line supply large quantity ammunition north korea summit ask russia assist north korea develop artificial satellite mr putin confirm primary reason meeting side appear willing overlook threat escalate international sanction summit mr kim vow fully unconditionally support moscow rocket technology hold particular interest mr kim regime outward support clandestine cyberattacksaccording report north korea long eyed russian technology resort cyber theft obtain moscow appear ready overlook despite recent report microsoft threat analysis center mtac mtac report indicate march year march north korean cyber operative launch attack russian aerospace research facility penetrate academic institution engage research additionally operative send phishing email personnel russian diplomatic agency study reveal country frequently target north korean cyberattack period include south korea israel germany russia hack group identify scarcruft lazarus covertly instal digital backdoor company system exfiltrate sensitive information extent hacker achievement remain unclear north korea announce significant advancement ballistic missile program mere month cyber attack initiate sputnix private enterprise affiliate russian academy sciences space research institute lose substantial information cyber incursion report speculate north korea steal critical technology relate design ultra small satellite body expert suggest north korea successful launch rocket equip reconnaissance satellite year likely capitalize prior hack exploit cyber activity appear crucial advance country space technology additionally report disclose north korean hacker penetrate internal network russia almaz antey lead manufacturer surface air missile intruder pilfer information include developer personal datum proprietary detail missile component north korean cyber operative exfiltrate design blueprint russia uralvagonzavod tank factory entity responsible produce russia generation t- armata battle tank report highlight frequency north korean cyber attack russian defense corporation specialize avant garde weapon system like hypersonic technology intercontinental ballistic missile icbms military commentator xia loshan tell epoch time sept north korea russia desperate situation north korea eager acquire military technology ultimate decision hand mr xia state emphasize alliance precarious likely unsustainable face stringent international sanction independent analyst zhuge mingyang weigh relationship mark utilitarian need genuine alliance nation recognize motivation tell epoch time moscow likely know pyongyang siphon military technology willing turn blind eye exchange need ammunition clear example friendship base mutual expediency

 Ukraine's Fate Will Be Decided In Coming Year, Top Zelensky Aide Admits

In surprisingly blunt words, a top aide to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that the coming year will essentially decide the fate of Ukraine and its war with Russia.

""A turning point in the war is approaching,"" Andrii Yermak, who serves as chief of staff for the Office of the President of Ukraine, said Monday. ""The next year will be decisive in this regard."" He issued the words while appealing for more urgent aid from Washington in an address to the hawkish DC-based Hudson Institute think tank.

Yermak sought to assure the audience that Zelensky has ""a clear plan"" forward even as Western media has by and large soured on Kiev's prospects for success. Much of this is about Zelensky sending envoys to do damage control in Washington at a moment the US administration's focus is off Ukraine and on Gaza events instead.

He described advancing plans for ""the development of our defense industry, and the deploying of our own arms production. But [that] will be later.""

But he quickly pivoted to an immediate need for more ""weapons right now""--describing that ""Russia still has air superiority. It is still capable of producing missiles, doing evasion of sanctions…And we especially need air defense systems.""

Without doubt, the Zelensky admin is in damage control after eyebrow-raising comments were issued to The Economist early this month by Ukraine's top commander, who admitted there will be no breakthrough and the battlefield situation is in a stalemate. The New York Times had characterized his remarks as ""the first time a top Ukrainian commander said the fighting had reached an impasse.""

So now Zelensky appears to be dispatching his envoys to calm Washington jitters over all the ""bad news"" of late out of Ukraine.

Yermak also sought to assure the Hudson Institute conference that more billions given to Ukraine won't be ""charity"" but is instead an ""investment"" in America's ""global leadership.""

He further emphasized Zelensky's continued rejection of ceasefire talks with Russia, unless it's purely on Kiev's terms. ""We seek peace, but not just any peace. In our case, ending the war through compromise is nothing more than pausing it. Ukraine will not repeat the mistake of Minsk,"" Yermak said.

EN_UA_103403.txt,Other,Other,"Russia Stages Major Airstrike on Ukraine; One Missile Enters Polish Airspace 

 KYIV—Russia struck critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s western region of Lviv with missiles early on March 24, Kyiv said, in a major airstrike that saw one Russian cruise missile briefly fly into Polish airspace, according to Warsaw.

Moscow launched 57 missiles and drones in the attack that also targeted Kyiv, two days after the largest aerial bombardment of Ukraine’s energy system in more than two years of full-scale war, Kyiv said.

“There were two preliminary hits on the same critical infrastructure facility that the occupiers targeted at night,” Lviv’s regional governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

The strike used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles, which are harder to shoot down, he added, without identifying the facility.

The energy ministry said equipment caught fire when a critical energy facility in the Lviv region was attacked, causing it to lose power. It was unclear whether they were talking about the same facility.

Air defences destroyed 18 of 29 inbound missiles and 25 of 28 attack drones, the Ukranian air force said.

There were almost no details about what had been damaged, but the targeting of critical infrastructure could indicate that Russia is trying to keep up pressure on the energy system after its strikes caused widespread blackouts on March 22.

The energy ministry said that Ukraine, which has been exporting power in recent weeks, had sharply increased imports of electricity and stopped exports on March 24 after attacks on the energy system.

Several explosions rang out in Kyiv in the early hours as air defences destroyed about a dozen missiles over the capital and in its vicinity, according to Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s military administration.

There was only minor damage from the attack, he said.

Small groups of people huddled for safety underground in a central Kyiv metro station in the early hours, some of them sleeping on camping mats.

Moscow has been pounding Ukraine for days in attacks portrayed by Moscow as revenge for Ukrainian attacks that were conducted during Russia’s presidential election.

The wreckage of a downed Kh-55 cruise missile was found in a Kyiv park, officials said.

“For the third pre-dawn morning this week, all of Ukraine is under an air alert and has been advised to seek shelter,” U.S. Ambassador Bridget Brink posted on social media platform X.

Polish AirspacePoland’s armed forces said a Russian cruise missile launched at the region of Lviv had violated Poland’s airspace.

“The object entered Polish space near the town of Oserdow [Lublin Voivodeship] and stayed there for 39 seconds,” it said on X. “During the entire flight, it was observed by military radar systems.”

Poland’s army spokesperson, Jacek Goryszewski, told reporters that the missile travelled about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) into Polish airspace before returning to Ukraine.

There was no immediate comment from Russia. Warsaw said it would demand an explanation from Moscow.

 ISLAMABAD-Pakistan needs to chalk out an effective and feasible plan to preserve its water resources and stop the depletion of underground water, WealthPK reported.

According to an expert, water is one of the basic necessities of life and Pakistan is blessed with an abundance of water resources. However, the country’s water resources are depleting with the passage of time. It is feared that the entire world will face an acute water shortage in the coming years. Saiqa Imran, the deputy director of the Pakistan Council of Research and Water Reservoirs (PCRWR), told WealthPK that the country was feared to face an acute shortage of fresh water. “The quantity of fresh water is quite limited in the country,” she added. According to her, climate change is the primary cause of the depletion of water resources. She said that the shortage of water triggered concerns about the future availability of water for the world’s exponentially rising population.

Saiqa Imran said that in most cases, the water table was constantly going down as a result of the frequent pumping of water from the ground. “With a growing world population, the more we pump water from the ground at a rapid rate, the harder it becomes to get the amount of water we need because we pump the groundwater faster than it can be replenished,” she added. She said that inefficient water distribution and mismanagement were the main causes of the water shortage. “Pakistan has one of the largest contiguous irrigation systems in the world where more than 93% of water is used by the agriculture sector, 5% by the domestic sector and 2% by the industrial sector,” said the expert.

She said that domestic and industrial sectors would use 15% more water by 2025 than their current consumption. She said that the agriculture sector was the biggest user of water as modern irrigation techniques were not adopted in Pakistan but its contribution to the national economy was declining with the passage of time. Saiqa Imran said that the world’s average storage capacity reached 40% but Pakistan could conserve only up to 10% of its annual river water due to insufficient space. “People have turned to use underground water as a result of the shortage of the most essential commodity. The indiscriminate over-pumping in the cities in the absence of regulatory bodies has also led to the depletion of groundwater,” she added.

According to her, there is a dire need to devise a proper pricing mechanism for water usage in any sector. She said that incentives should also be in place to encourage people to use water efficiently. The expert said that the country could take a variety of technical and management measures to conserve water at all levels, reduce irrigation losses, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient irrigation methods by creating a regulatory framework, launch licensing water, and implement integrated water resource management. “Under the principle of private sector participation and optimal water pricing, the policymakers should rethink water policy to encourage wastewater recycling,” Saiqa Imran told WealthPK.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],strategy need preserve water resource pakistan islamabad pakistan need chalk effective feasible plan preserve water resource stop depletion underground water wealthpk report accord expert water basic necessity life pakistan bless abundance water resource country water resource deplete passage time fear entire world face acute water shortage come year saiqa imran deputy director pakistan council research water reservoir pcrwr tell wealthpk country fear face acute shortage fresh water quantity fresh water limited country add accord climate change primary cause depletion water resource say shortage water trigger concern future availability water world exponentially rise population saiqa imran say case water table constantly go result frequent pumping water ground grow world population pump water ground rapid rate hard water need pump groundwater fast replenish add say inefficient water distribution mismanagement main cause water shortage pakistan large contiguous irrigation system world water agriculture sector domestic sector industrial sector say expert say domestic industrial sector use water current consumption say agriculture sector big user water modern irrigation technique adopt pakistan contribution national economy decline passage time saiqa imran say world average storage capacity reach pakistan conserve annual river water insufficient space people turn use underground water result shortage essential commodity indiscriminate pumping city absence regulatory body lead depletion groundwater add accord dire need devise proper pricing mechanism water usage sector say incentive place encourage people use water efficiently expert say country variety technical management measure conserve water level reduce irrigation loss encourage farmer adopt efficient irrigation method create regulatory framework launch licensing water implement integrate water resource management principle private sector participation optimal water pricing policymaker rethink water policy encourage wastewater recycling saiqa imran tell wealthpk

Pentagon bean-counters now claim that an ‘accounting error’ may have resulted in Kiev being supposedly shortchanged of billions in US weapons and ammunition.

Kiev’s money pit: the billion dollar grift just got that much more corrupt…

The US Department of Defense has discovered an accounting error that could result in even more weapons, ammunition and equipment being available for Ukraine than previously thought, Reuters reported on Thursday.

The agency cited a Senate aide and a Pentagon official – both anonymous – who said that the US military had “overestimated the value” of some of its hardware that was sent to Kiev by “around $3 billion.”

The Pentagon used the current replacement costs for equipment taken from its stocks, rather than factoring in the original purchase price and depreciation, according to the agency’s source. The DOD is reportedly taking steps to notify Congress of the “accounting adjustment.”

Senator Roger Wicker, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Reuters that the Pentagon made a “major mistake” that could underestimate future needs of NATO allies.

“Our priority should be a Ukrainian victory over [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. Unilaterally altering military aid calculations is an attempt at deception and undermines this goal,” said the senator from Mississippi.

However, the accounting confusion may translate into even more supplies to the Kiev government, according to the agency. As of Monday, the US was reportedly down to only $6 billion in Ukraine aid, from the $48 billion approved by Congress in December. Getting more funding approved is difficult at the moment, due to the standoff over the national debt ceiling.

Washington’s efforts to pump Kiev with weapons consist of two tracks. The Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) allows the Pentagon to send materiel from its own stockpiles – to the tune of $21.1 billion so far, in 37 separate packages. The separate Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) has the US government pay the military industry to make new weapons and ammunition, much of which has yet to arrive.

According to Reuters, the Pentagon sent a memo to all four service branches the Army, Navy, Air Force and the Marine Corps – on March 31, clarifying how the value of the equipment should be calculated. The anonymous Pentagon official speaking to the agency used the example of 155mm artillery shells, of which more than 1.5 million were sent to Kiev. While each costs about $800 today, the cost over several decades averages out to much less.

Ukraine has repeatedly said that its successes on the battlefield heavily depends on the aid from the West. According to Russian military estimates, the US and its allies had delivered over $100 billion worth of weapons and supplies to Ukraine by December 2022.

Moscow has warned Washington that this elevates the risk of direct confrontation. However, the US and NATO have insisted that arming Kiev does not actually make them a party to the conflict.

Ukraine and the West have resorted to false flag operations to persuade everyone that ISIS* was behind the terror attack in the Crocus City Hall concert venue near Moscow, said Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of Sputnik's parent media group Rossiya Segodnya.

The head of the media group stressed that the names and faces of the perpetrators are already known to authorities and that the terrorists gave everything away during interrogation.

“It immediately became obvious why US media were claiming in unison that it was ISIS,"" she said.

Simonyan explained that the perpetrators were chosen to carry out the attack in a manner that would allow the West to persuade the international community that ISIS was behind the attack.

“Basic sleight of hand. The level of a railway thimble-rigger,"" she added."" It has nothing to do with ISIS. It's Ukrainians.""

She added that the enthusiasm displayed by Western media when they tried to persuade everyone that ISIS was responsible even before arrests were made gave them away completely.

“This is not ISIS. This is a well-coordinated team of several other, also widely known, abbreviations,"" Simonyan concluded.

The shooting occurred on Friday evening in the Crocus City Hall concert venue just outside Moscow and was followed by a massive fire, claiming at least 143 lives.

In the hours following the attack, Western media insisted that radical jihadist organization ISIS was behind it, while Ukrainian officials also said that they had nothing to do with the tragedy.

However, suspects were detained in Russia's Bryansk region near Ukrainian border. According to the data provided by law enforcing agencies, they had a support base on the other side of the border.

Moreover, while Kiev rushed to deny its involvement into the shooting, Ukrainian secret services have a long track record of terror attacks on Russian territory, from shelling in the Belgorod region to assassinations of political scientist Daria Dugina and journalist Vladlen Tatarsky.

Nato might deploy more nuclear weapons amid an increasing threat posed by Russia and China, according to the head of the alliance.

Jens Stoltenberg, the 13th secretary general of Nato, revealed there were live discussions among members about removing missiles from storage and putting them on standby to act as a deterrent.

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'I won't go into operational details about how many nuclear warheads should be operational and which should be stored, but we need to consult on these issues. That's exactly what we're doing.'

It comes as the head of Kyiv's national security council said Putin could demand a tactical nuclear weapon be used if Russia's army is beaten in Ukraine.

Oleksandr Lytvynenko made the comments after G7 leaders warned any use by Russia of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons would be met with 'severe consequences', The Times reported.

Meanwhile, Mr Stoltenberg warned in Brussels of the threat from China, adding that nuclear transparency should form the basis of Nato's nuclear strategy to prepare the alliance for the dangers of the world.

'Nato's aim is, of course, a world without nuclear weapons, but as long as nuclear weapons exist, we will remain a nuclear alliance, because a world where Russia, China and North Korea have nuclear weapons, and Nato does not, is a more dangerous world,' he said.

Mr Stoltenberg claimed that China is heavily investing in modern weaponry, which includes its nuclear arsenal, which the secretary general said would increase to 1,000 possibly by 2030.

He insisted the US and its European allies are modernising their nuclear deterrent as a result of heightened threat from Russia.

'The US is modernising their gravity bombs for the nuclear warheads they have in Europe and European allies are modernising the planes which are going to be dedicated to Nato's nuclear mission,' he said.

It comes as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky yesterday accused Russia of not wanting peace, after Putin said he would only accept a ceasefire if Ukraine agreed to halt its NATO ascension plans.

Zelensky made the accusation at the end of a major diplomatic summit in Switzerland, which more than 90 countries attended, making it the largest gathering in support of Ukraine since the start of the invasion.

The conference saw the vast majority of the 90 nations who attended sign a communique in support of Ukraine sovereignty, and also called for Putin to return children stolen during the invasion.",EN,"['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",nato talk deploy nuclear weapon amid grow threat pose russia china ukrainian security chief warn putin firebomb kyiv tactical nuke face catastrophic defeat nato talk deploy nuclear weapon amid grow threat pose russia china ukrainian security chief warn putin firebomb kyiv tactical nuke face catastrophic defeat nato deploy nuclear weapon amid increase threat pose russia china accord head alliance jens stoltenberg th secretary general nato reveal live discussion member remove missile storage put standby act deterrent speak telegraph mr stoltenberg say operational detail nuclear warhead operational store need consult issue exactly come head kyiv national security council say putin demand tactical nuclear weapon russia army beat ukraine oleksandr lytvynenko comment leader warn use russia chemical biological nuclear weapon meet severe consequence time report jens stoltenberg picture th secretary general nato reveal live discussion member remove missile storage put standby netherlands air force f- jetfighter take nato exercise nato air policing mission head kyiv national security council say putin demand tactical nuclear weapon russia army beat ukraine russian soldier load iskander short range ballistic missile launcher firing position russian military drill intend train troop tactical nuclear weapon mr stoltenberg warn brussels threat china add nuclear transparency form basis nato nuclear strategy prepare alliance danger world nato aim course world nuclear weapon long nuclear weapon exist remain nuclear alliance world russia china north korea nuclear weapon nato dangerous world say mr stoltenberg claim china heavily invest modern weaponry include nuclear arsenal secretary general say increase possibly insist european ally modernise nuclear deterrent result heighten threat russia modernise gravity bomb nuclear warhead europe european ally modernise plane go dedicate nato nuclear mission say come ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky yesterday accuse russia want peace putin say accept ceasefire ukraine agree halt nato ascension plan zelensky accusation end major diplomatic summit switzerland country attend make large gathering support ukraine start invasion conference see vast majority nation attend sign communique support ukraine sovereignty call putin return child steal invasion
EN_UA_023211.txt,Other,Other,"Europe Putin thanks US journalist Tucker Carlson for interview 

 Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

ussian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said he was grateful to controversial right-wing US talk show host Tucker Carlson for his interview last week and ""intermediary"" role with the West.

Former Fox News star Carlson released a two-hour interview with Putin in Moscow last Thursday, just ahead of the two-year anniversary of Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

In it, the Russian president said the West needed to understand that it was ""impossible"" for Russia to be defeated in Ukraine.

""Since we are not able to have direct dialogue (with the West) today... we have to be grateful to Mr Carlson to be able to do it by his intermediary"" role, Putin told journalists in quotes distributed by the Kremlin.

Even so, Putin said he was ""not totally satisfied"" with the interview, the first he has given to a Western journalist since launching his offensive in Ukraine.

It has been seen more than 200 million times on X, formerly Twitter.

Putin's disappointment, though, seemed to stem from his hopes for a more bellicose exchange, saying that he expected Carlson to be more ""aggressive"" and was waiting for ""difficult questions"".

""I was not only ready for that but I was hoping for it because that would have allowed me to reply in the same manner,"" Putin said.

Carlson came in for criticism from Western media for the lack of tough questions in the interview, in which Putin lectured him on his views of Russian history, portraying the country as a victim of Western betrayals.

Putin acknowledged that Carlson had ""tried to interrupt me several times"" but praised the conservative journalist, who is close to former US president Donald Trump, for his ""patience"".

The Russian leader did complain, though, that his quotes were ""deformed"" in Western media.

 The Biden administration has no plans to replenish the stockpile of controversial cluster bombs it’s sending to Ukraine, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

“Our current plan is not to replenish that stockpile,” Sullivan told NBC News’ “Meet the Press.” .

“It is rather to build up the capacity to produce the unitary round of the 155, the non-cluster munition round of ammunition,” he said.

Earlier this month, President Biden opted to send the divisive ammunition to Ukraine — and publicly acknowledged he was prompted to do so because the military is running low on 155 mm artillery ammunition rounds.

A chorus of critics — both abroad and at home — decried the decision, citing the grave dangers cluster munitions pose to civilians given their dud rates.

Sullivan echoed Biden’s defense — that the US must supply Ukraine with adequate firepower.

“We began that process months ago was we anticipated the need for continuing supply Ukraine, but it takes time and that is why we need a bridge from today,” he said, referencing steps to boost production of 155 mm rounds.

“We need to ensure that Ukraine has the necessary supply of ammunition to a few months down the road, when we believe we can supply enough of the unitary round to meet Ukraine’s defense needs.”

Cluster bombs are prohibited by over 100 countries across the world, including multiple NATO members.

Military officials claim the cluster bombs being sent to Ukraine have a dud rate of around 2.35% or less — markedly lower than the roughly 30% and 40% dud rate estimated for Russia’s cluster munitions being deployed against Ukraine.

The dud rate refers to the likelihood of the bomblets in the cluster munitions not exploding after being deployed.

Bomblets that are duds may detonate long after being deployed.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin previously committed to having the US help Ukraine scour and clean up duds from those munitions.

Sullivan insisted dissemination of the controversial bombs doesn’t undercut US’ “moral authority.”

“Our moral authority and Ukraine’s moral authority in this conflict comes from the fact that we are supporting a country under brutal, vicious attack by its neighbor with missiles and bombs raining down in its cities, killing its civilians, destroying its schools, it’s churches, its hospitals,” he said.

“The idea that providing Ukraine with a weapon in order for them to be able to defend their homeland, protect their civilians is somehow a challenge for moral authority I find questionable,” he added.

Last week, NATO held a summit in Vilinius, lithuania, and ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s visit there, he slammed NATO allies for their position on admitting the war-torn nation into the powerful alliance.

Sullivan reiterated the US position that Ukraine can receive admittance once it wraps up the necessary reforms to meet the alliance’s democracy requirements.

“We could have said it more clearly,” Sullivan said, alluding to a NATO communique. “Ukraine’s future will be in NATO. Period full stop. That was a single, clear sentence.

 In recent months, climate change exremists have taken to vandalizing pieces of fine art, smearing famous paintings and sculptures with soup and paint.

Some of these supposed activists are acutally being funded by people in Hollywood, who you would think had some sort of respect for fine art.

In truth, they care more about the left’s radical agenda.

The Washington Examiner reports:

Hollywood and left-wing foundations behind climate charity quietly bankrolling extremist protest groups

A little-known climate change advocacy organization heavily funded by celebrities and influential left-leaning foundations has been quietly dishing out grants to various activist groups deploying unorthodox and extremist methods across the world to protest fossil fuels, documents reveal.

Anti-fossil fuels groups have been ramping up protests in the United States and overseas as part of a coordinated campaign to bring awareness to climate change by vandalizing fine art, blocking major roads, and even gluing themselves to sports cars. Many of these activist hubs are being bankrolled by Climate Emergency Fund, a Beverly Hills-based charity linked to Hollywood celebrities and top liberal nonprofit organizations aiming to shape the Democratic Party’s agenda, according to tax forms and other documents reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

“Climate Emergency Fund has quickly become the ATM that radical environmental activists turn to fund their latest disruptions,” Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the conservative watchdog Americans for Public Trust, told the Washington Examiner. “And as their destruction increases, so should the scrutiny on who is bankrolling the Climate Emergency Fund and their ties to more mainstream environmental groups that might disagree with these over-the-top and dangerous tactics.”…

And, unlike the typical run-of-the-mill charity, CEF boasts a star-studded cohort of financial backers and board members, including Rory Kennedy, daughter of the late senator Robert F. Kennedy, Aileen Getty, the billionaire philanthropist and heiress of the Getty family fortune earned in the petroleum industry, and even Hollywood’s Adam McKay, who pledged it $4 million in September 2022 and directed the 2021 climate allegory film Don’t Look Up.

CEF celebrity funders also include Jeremy Strong, who plays Kendall Roy in the HBO TV series Succession, comedian Chelsea Handler, actor and Silicon Valley star Thomas Middleditch, and Abigail Disney, daughter of ex-Disney executive Roy E. Disney, according to CEF’s annual 2022 report.

Take a bow, Hollywood liberals. This is what you are funding:

 Letters to the Editor: No, Korean BBQ isn’t going away because of L.A.’s new gas law

To the editor: As an Asian American and advocate for healthier, safer communities for all, I was really disappointed by the article, “The end of Korean BBQ in L.A.? What the gas stove ban means for your fave restaurants.”

People in my community freaked out over the headline, re-sharing this misleading article many times on social media. Simply put, the truth is this: Our favorite restaurants will be fine, as the city of Los Angeles’ ban on most gas appliances in new construction does not apply to existing buildings or existing Korean BBQ restaurants. Their kitchens do not have to be altered due to this measure.

I talked to people who re-shared the article online who did not understand this simple truth based on your headline and article.

That said, I appreciated some commentary in the article about the concerns of chefs who are used to cooking with gas and are thinking about opening new restaurants. It is my hope that chefs across L.A. can discover new ways to cook without harmful gas.

The wok was invented thousands of years ago and used without fossil fuels, and today, we have induction cooking, which I can personally attest is a wonderful way to cook without toxic emissions. We’re all in this together, so let’s act now to deliver a healthier future for generations to come.

Jennifer Ho, La Crescenta

..

To the editor: The California Restaurant Assn. is on the wrong side of history in its opposition to all-electric kitchens. Sadly, this is not the first time restaurant associations have opposed public health and safety measures. In fact, restaurant associations once fought smoke-free laws, with funding from Big Tobacco.

To protect public health and reduce climate emissions from gas stoves, our kitchens and homes will need to be upgraded from gas to electric. Thankfully, induction cooking is a superior cooking technology that keeps kitchens cooler and safer. For chefs cooking primarily with woks, there are electric woks.

Climate change and the health dangers of gas are not going away. Instead of ignoring the problem or fighting health-protective solutions, our field must innovate to continue to prepare the dishes we love safely for our families and customers — and the planet.

EN_UA_300092.txt,Other,Other,"America Last: House Bill Provides $26B for Israel, $61B for Ukraine and Zero to Secure U.S. Border 


House Speaker Mike Johnson’s newly unveiled foreign aid bill includes over $26 billion for Israel — $12 billion more than the previous bill which asked for $14 billion — $61 billion for Ukraine and absolutely nothing to secure America’s borders.

As Sen. Rand Paul notes, Johnson is also putting forward bills to ban TikTok (to silence criticism of Israel), turn American businesses into NSA spies and seize Russia’s assets to give to Ukraine in an act of war (the REPO Act).

Speaker Johnson and the Uniparty are united behind their laundry list of bad ideas. From borrowing $95 billion from China to send it to other countries to killing a FISA warrant requirement — they’re ticking all the boxes to put America last.

— Rand Paul (@RandPaul) April 17, 2024

From Reuters, “US House sets long-awaited vote on billions for Ukraine, Israel”:

The U.S. House of Representatives will have its long-awaited vote on aid for Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific as soon as Saturday, Republican Speaker Mike Johnson said on Wednesday, paving the way for its possible passage despite fierce objections from the right wing of his conference.

The House Appropriations Committee unveiled legislation providing more than $95 billion in security assistance, including $60.84 billion to address the conflict in Ukraine and assist regional partners as they handle Russia’s invasion, of which $23.2 billion would be used to replenish U.S. weapons, stocks and facilities.

The effort to pass security aid gained new urgency following Iran’s unprecedented attacks on Israel over the weekend in retaliation for a suspected Israeli airstrike on Iran’s embassy compound in Damascus on April 1.

The Israel bill totals $26.38 billion, some of which will cover the cost of U.S. military operations in response to recent attacks. And $9.1 billion of the total is designated for humanitarian needs, something Democrats had demanded for them to support the bill.

As a reminder, the Intercept reported on Monday that the U.S. — not Israel — shot down the majority of the drones and missiles Iran fired at Israel.

Reuters continues:

The Indo-Pacific measure totals $8.12 billion.

Johnson said he would give House members 72 hours from the bill’s introduction – until mid-day Saturday – to review the bill. He said the chamber would vote on final passage on Saturday evening.

He also said he would release a separate border security bill, meeting a demand from conservatives.

Democratic President Joe Biden said he strongly supported the package. He called on the House to pass it this week and the Senate to quickly follow. “I will sign this into law immediately to send a message to the world: We stand with our friends, and we won’t let Iran or Russia succeed,” Biden said in a statement.

This bill is literally worse than the one they tanked a few weeks ago.

Recently, some readers have complained to me that we are covering the Ukraine situation too closely, saying they are bored with the topic.

In fact, I’m not really covering it that closely. I’m really just giving the broad strokes, and giving people a basis upon which they can do further investigation into what is going on if they are so inclined.

If readers find the coverage boring, they can skip over it. There is a lot of other stuff on this site. I am covering the Ukraine the exact right amount. I am obligated to do this because so few outlets are covering the war with any truth or honesty. In the English language, the pro-Russia perspective is very difficult to find, with most conservatives who are against the war simply saying that they don’t care either way. “I do care and I actively support those fighting against the Washington and Brussels elite” is an important perspective that must be in the public conversation.

Someone is going to win this conflict, and someone is going to lose. The stakes could not be any higher. The future of the entire world now hinges on the outcome of this conflict. This is the single most consequential military conflict in all of human history.

If Russia loses, the Putin government will collapse, and the US will be able to steamroll the country, break it apart into several pieces. From there, the US will have China isolated, and then eventually break them. This will result in the final establishment of a singular world order run by the Jewish power centers in the United States, Europe, and Israel.

If the US loses the war, we are looking at a freefall collapse of the Western economic and military order, a rising China, and a reshuffling of the entire order of power on the planet earth.

The reason I support Russia is that I want the US empire to collapse. The reason I want the US empire to collapse is that I do not believe that the US empire is compatible with freedom in the US, and believe that we can only reestablish freedom in this country when the empire falls.

If the dollar goes down and the US can no longer export debt to the world through the dollar reserve system, the US government will no longer have the ability to micromanage the lives of American citizens. They will not have the resources (you have to have a lot of excess money to inflict your will on the entire population, which is one reason why people are so much freer in third world countries). We will be free, and we will then be able to return to the natural order in our society, without Jews controlling everything, without trannies, without deadly fake vaccines, without mass immigration, without feminism.

 A report from these two schools says that with the exception of Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast, all other smaller and local airports will need to disappear by 2029 in order for the war on ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" to eventually be won.

Air travelers who require regional transfers to and from the three larger airports after that time will need to take rail or a car instead, as these are considered by the globalists to be much better forms of transport for the climate.

The only way for even Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast to remain open between 2029 and 2049 is if all other airports close down by 2029, and if all air transfers within the UK be migrated to ground transfers. If that is achieved, then the Big Three can stay open until 2049.

After that, the report states, all airports, including the Big Three, will need to be closed down permanently, leaving residents trapped right where they are. This, we are told, will ""cool"" down the planet and create a climate utopia.

""In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,"" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.

In order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates ""emissions,"" regardless of the energy source.

Meat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.

By 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be ""phased out"" between 2030 and 2049.

No more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.

""The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,"" the report states.

The West has destroyed free global competition and the immunity of property, Russia’s foreign minister says

The US is using the dollar to unleash trade wars worldwide, while international economic cooperation is also being weaponized, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Monday.

The US and its allies in the EU are using a wide range of “geopolitical engineering” tools, which include, among other things “unleashing trade and economic wars,” Lavrov stated, speaking at the Primakov Readings International Forum.

“The activities of the World Trade Organization, primarily for settling disputes, have been blocked by Western countries. Such fundamental legal foundations of world economic relations as free competition and the immunity of property have been destroyed,” the Russian diplomat noted.

Lavrov went on to assert that the American currency has long been used as a weapon, adding that “destructive actions” by Western nations have resulted in producing the opposite effect to the intended one. The diplomat argued that US-led sanctions aimed at isolating Russia and crippling its economy in reality have stimulated the “strengthening of multipolarity in international affairs.”

According to Lavrov, there is a growing awareness in the world that “no one is immune” in the face of the “aggressive actions of Washington and Brussels.”

He noted that not only Russia but many other countries are now “consistently” reducing their dependence on Western currencies by switching to alternatives for foreign-trade settlements.

The global trend towards using national currencies in trade instead of the US dollar began to gain momentum last year after Ukraine-related sanctions saw Russia cut off from the Western financial system and also saw its foreign reserves frozen.

As multipolarity takes shape, more nations are working on creating new transport corridors and supply chains. Meanwhile, an “unfair” and “unbalanced” model of globalization has become outdated, Lavrov said.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire']",weaponize dollar lavrov west destroy free global competition immunity property russia foreign minister say dollar unleash trade war worldwide international economic cooperation weaponize russia foreign minister sergey lavrov say monday ally eu wide range geopolitical engineering tool include thing unleash trade economic war lavrov state speak primakov reading international forum activity world trade organization primarily settle dispute block western country fundamental legal foundation world economic relation free competition immunity property destroy russian diplomat note lavrov go assert american currency long weapon add destructive action western nation result produce opposite effect intend diplomat argue lead sanction aim isolate russia cripple economy reality stimulate strengthening multipolarity international affair accord lavrov grow awareness world immune face aggressive action washington brussels note russia country consistently reduce dependence western currency switch alternative foreign trade settlement global trend national currency trade instead dollar begin gain momentum year ukraine relate sanction see russia cut western financial system see foreign reserve freeze multipolarity take shape nation work create new transport corridor supply chain unfair unbalanced model globalization outdate lavrov say

 President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused US politicians of playing political games around the issue of aid for his country and claims that they don’t care how many people in Ukraine are dying.

Zelensky made his comments as US lawmakers prepared to vote on a controversial aid package for Ukraine that has been stalled in Congress for months due to a bitter dispute between Democrats and Republicans.

RT reports: In an interview on Monday, Zelensky referred to comments made at the weekend by Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson. The US politician told Fox News that he planned to move forward with a vote on an aid bill for Israel this week, without specifying when a Ukraine package would be taken up, or whether it would be tied to funding for West Jerusalem.

“This is pure politics, and it’s a disgrace for the world and a disgrace for democracy,” Zelensky told PBS NewsHour. “Nobody cares how many people are dying in Ukraine every day. They only care about their approval ratings,” he added

Johnson has since promised to advance the long-stalled Ukraine aid bill sought by President Joe Biden this week, multiple news outlets reported on Monday. Johnson reportedly told Republican colleagues at a closed-door meeting that he intends to allow the House to vote on a standalone bill in the coming days that would ensure additional military aid for Kiev. The House will also be expected to vote on separate bills providing more assistance to Israel and Taiwan.

House Republicans have previously refused to back the foreign aid bill unveiled by Biden in October, which includes $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine.

The legislation has been held up for months as the GOP tries to force the White House to crack down on the influx of illegal immigrants via the southern US border. Biden’s 2024 election rival, former President Donald Trump, previously urged Republicans to block the bill, arguing against unconditional aid for Ukraine.

The delay in approving more weapons for Ukraine has rattled Zelensky and other officials in Kiev, who are blaming mounting battlefield losses on shortages of foreign-supplied ammunition and air defenses.

In his interview with PBS, Zelensky reiterated that without the US support, Ukraine “will have no chance of winning” in its conflict with Russia.

Moscow, meanwhile, has repeatedly stated that no amount of foreign assistance will change the outcome of the fighting, and has accused the West of escalating the hostilities.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",zelensky say politician don care ukraine president volodymyr zelensky accuse politician play political game issue aid country claim don care people ukraine die zelensky comment lawmaker prepare vote controversial aid package ukraine stall congress month bitter dispute democrats republicans bypass censor sign unfiltered news deliver straight inbox unsubscribe time subscribe agree term use late video rt report interview monday zelensky refer comment weekend republican house speaker mike johnson politician tell fox news plan forward vote aid bill israel week specify ukraine package take tie funding west jerusalem pure politic disgrace world disgrace democracy zelensky tell pbs newshour care people die ukraine day care approval rating add johnson promise advance long stall ukraine aid bill seek president joe biden week multiple news outlet report monday johnson reportedly tell republican colleague closed door meeting intend allow house vote standalone bill come day ensure additional military aid kiev house expect vote separate bill provide assistance israel taiwan house republicans previously refuse foreign aid bill unveil biden october include billion assistance ukraine legislation hold month gop try force white house crack influx illegal immigrant southern border biden election rival president donald trump previously urge republicans block bill argue unconditional aid ukraine delay approve weapon ukraine rattle zelensky official kiev blame mount battlefield loss shortage foreign supply ammunition air defense interview pbs zelensky reiterate support ukraine chance win conflict russia moscow repeatedly state foreign assistance change outcome fighting accuse west escalate hostility
EN_UA_300037.txt,Other,Other,"Israeli Official Warns Russia: You’re Next 

Amir Weitmann, the head of the libertarian caucus in Israel’s Likud Party, appeared on Russia’s RT last week and expressed his outrage at Russia’s stance on the war since fighting broke out.

“Russia is supporting the enemies of Israel. Russia is supporting Nazi people who want to commit genocide on us and Russia will pay the price,” Weitmann said, according to Newsweek. “We’re gonna win this war. Afterwards, we’re not forgetting what you’re doing, we’re not forgetting, we will come, we will make sure Ukraine wins. We will make sure that you pay the price for what you have done, you as Russia.”

The host of the program said Moscow has been calling for a ceasefire and has been looking for a solution to the conflict in Israel.

“I understand you’re on the Russian payroll, and I understand this is Russian propaganda. But you have to be very careful, because, let me tell you, we’re going to finish this war. We’re going to win because we’re stronger,” he said, according to The New Voice of Ukraine.

The New York Times reported that Putin once had a relatively close relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but since the outbreak of the Ukraine War, there seems to be a chill. The paper noted that as of Friday, the Russian leader has not reached out to his Israeli counterpart.

Instead, Putin—while condemning the Hamas attack—said the incident was a “clear example of the failure of United States policy in the Middle East.” While making clear that he believes Israel has an obligation to defend itself, Washington’s knee-jerk reaction is to never take into account the “fundamental interests of the Palestinian people.”

Erdogan seemed to agree, saying: “If the West has the slightest respect for human rights, it must discuss the types of aid that should be sent to Gaza. There is no way to bring peace to the Middle East except through establishing a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders.”

 The G20 leaders are set to state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the summit in Bali, a British newspaper reported on Tuesday, citing a draft communique agreed by diplomats involved in the negotiations to finalise the document.

The key line on the Ukraine conflict in the draft communique almost echoes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's message to Russian President Vladimir Putin in September that 'today's era is not of war'.

There have been a series of negotiations among the diplomats of the G20 member countries over the formulation relating to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Russia and China are also members of the G-20 which operate on the principle of consensus.

In his bilateral meeting with Putin in Uzbekistan on September 16, Modi said ""today's era is not of war"" and nudged him to end the conflict.

The Indian delegation played a big role in achieving consensus among member states over the wording criticising the Russian invasion, the Financial Times (FT) said, citing two unnamed officials with knowledge of the negotiations.

Prime Minister Modi and several leaders of the G20 countries touched upon the Ukraine crisis in their remarks at the grouping's summit that began in Bali on Tuesday.

World leaders will state that today's era ""must not be of war"" at the G20 summit in Bali, according to a draft communique agreed by diplomats that also condemned threats of nuclear weapons use, the newspaper said.

""The use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. The peaceful resolution of conflicts, efforts to address crises, as well as diplomacy and dialogue, are vital. Today's era must not be of war,"" the draft statement said, according to FT.

The communique was agreed by country delegates on Monday night but must still be signed off by G20 leaders at the two-day summit, the report said.

The G20 ""will make clear that Russia's war is wreaking havoc for people everywhere"", the report said, quoting a senior US official.

An Indonesian official said discussions on the draft statement were ""still dynamic"" and might change, it said.

In his address at the summit, Modi on Tuesday referred to his repeated call for resolving the crisis through talks.

""I have repeatedly said that we have to find a way to return to the path of ceasefire and diplomacy in Ukraine. Over the past century, the Second World War wreaked havoc in the world,"" he said.

Since the Ukraine conflict began in February, Prime Minister Modi spoke to Russian President Putin as well as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a number of times.

In a phone conversation with Zelenskyy on October 4, Modi said that there can be ""no military solution"" and that India is ready to contribute to any peace efforts.

 Lawsuit filed in bid to halt Alaska oil drilling project

Washington (AFP) – Environmental groups filed a lawsuit on Tuesday seeking to halt a controversial oil drilling project in Alaska approved by the Biden administration.


The Interior Department gave the green light on Monday to US energy giant ConocoPhillips to drill for oil at three sites in the federally owned National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska's pristine western Arctic.

Environmental groups had urged President Joe Biden, who vowed during the 2020 White House race not to approve any new oil and gas leases on public lands, to reject the so-called Willow Project.

The six groups that filed the suit in US District Court accused the Interior Department and other agencies of violating the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and other laws by authorizing the project.

""ConocoPhillips' massive oil and gas project presents a real threat to the wildlife, ecosystems, and communities of Arctic Alaska,"" said Mike Scott of the Sierra Club, one of the complainants in the suit.

""If they're allowed to break ground, the Willow Project would be a disaster for the climate, the effects of which would be felt for decades,"" Scott said in a statement.

Reacting to the Biden administration's approval of the project on Monday, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan said that legal efforts to stop the project had been expected.

""We are prepared to defend this decision against likely frivolous legal challenges from the same Lower 48 NGOs who've consistently tried to kill the Willow Project,"" Sullivan said.

Alaska lawmakers lobbied strongly for approval of the drilling plan, defending it as a source of several thousand jobs and a contributor to US energy independence, with production of 180,000 barrels of oil per day at its peak, or some 576 million barrels over 30 years.

The Willow Project will add 239 million metric tons of carbon emissions to the atmosphere over the next 30 years, according to Interior Department calculations, equivalent to the annual emissions of 64 coal-fired power plants.

Biden has pledged to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005, with the goal of achieving a net zero emissions economy by no later than 2050.

EN_UA_300099.txt,URW: Amplifying war-related fears,URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed,"US ‘Concerned’ About Nuclear Escalation Risk From Russia but Not Changing ‘Nuclear Posture’: White House 

 The Biden administration is very “concerned” that Russia might escalate its invasion of Ukraine and use nuclear weapons, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday.

In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash on “State of the Union,” Sullivan said the United States was monitoring Russia’s moves closely but noted that officials have not yet seen anything that would require them to change their “nuclear posture.”

“We are watching this extremely closely, and obviously, the escalation risk with a nuclear power is severe, and it is a different kind of conflict than other conflicts the American people have seen over the years,” Sullivan said.

“And the American President, Joe Biden, has to take that responsibility extremely seriously, even as we redouble our efforts to support the Ukrainians. As things stand today, the United States has not adjusted our nuclear posture, but it is something that we monitor day by day, hour by hour, because it is a paramount priority to the president.”

When asked if the Biden administration was “concerned” about the situation, Sullivan said, “Anytime you have a nuclear power fighting in a conflict zone in Europe near NATO territory, of course we have to focus on and be concerned about the possibility of escalation, the risk of escalation.”

However, Sullivan again doubled down on his previous comment that officials “have not seen anything that would require us to change our nuclear posture at this time.”

Within days of invading Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces on high alert, blaming the “hostile actions” and statements of Western nations and NATO.

“Western countries are not only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic area. I’m speaking about the illegitimate sanctions that everyone is well aware of. However, the top officials of the leading NATO countries also make aggressive statements against our country as well,” Putin said in a televised meeting with top ministers.

As a result, Putin said that he has ordered “the minister of defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty.”

The deterrence forces include command of Russia’s vast arsenal of nuclear weapons, although it is unclear what a “special mode of combat duty” refers to.

Putin’s order means that Russia’s nuclear weapons are prepared for the increased possibility of launch, raising the possibility that Western nations could be subject to nuclear strikes if they get too involved in the Ukraine conflict.

However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on March 9 called Putin’s threat to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine–Russia conflict a “bluff.”

On March 13, Russian and Ukrainian negotiators said that there had been progress in talks between both sides regarding a potential end to the conflict.

The Kyiv government is continuing to demand an “end of the war and the withdrawal of [Russian] troops,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, wrote on Twitter, adding that he believes Ukraine will “achieve some results literally in a matter of days.”

While both sides appear to be optimistic about the potential to end the more than two-week-long conflict, no further details were provided.",EN,['URW: Amplifying war-related fears'],['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed'],concern nuclear escalation risk russia change nuclear posture white house biden administration concerned russia escalate invasion ukraine use nuclear weapon u.s national security adviser jake sullivan say sunday interview cnn dana bash state union sullivan say united states monitor russia move closely note official see require change nuclear posture watch extremely closely obviously escalation risk nuclear power severe different kind conflict conflict american people see year sullivan say american president joe biden responsibility extremely seriously redouble effort support ukrainian thing stand today united states adjust nuclear posture monitor day day hour hour paramount priority president ask biden administration concern situation sullivan say anytime nuclear power fighting conflict zone europe near nato territory course focus concern possibility escalation risk escalation sullivan double previous comment official see require change nuclear posture time day invade ukraine russian president vladimir putin order nuclear force high alert blame hostile action statement western nation nato western country take unfriendly action country economic area speak illegitimate sanction aware official lead nato country aggressive statement country putin say televise meeting minister result putin say order minister defense chief general staff russian armed force transfer deterrence force russian army special mode combat duty deterrence force include command russia vast arsenal nuclear weapon unclear special mode combat duty refer putin order mean russia nuclear weapon prepare increase possibility launch raise possibility western nation subject nuclear strike involved ukraine conflict ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky march call putin threat use nuclear weapon ukraine russia conflict bluff march russian ukrainian negotiator say progress talk side potential end conflict kyiv government continue demand end war withdrawal russian troop mykhailo podolyak adviser zelensky write twitter add believe ukraine achieve result literally matter day side appear optimistic potential end week long conflict detail provide

 Australia may be striving to cut industrial emissions but will continue to export manufacturing jobs without a tax on carbon-rich imports, a summit has been told.

A mechanism covering the biggest emitters looks good but is an ""ineffective tool"" without a border tax, Vik Bansal, chief executive of construction materials giant Boral, warned on Thursday.

""We just move carbon emissions to Asia,"" he told the Australasian Emissions Reduction Summit in Sydney.

""But we live on one Earth.""

Mr Bansal also defended Boral's move to less ambitious emissions reduction targets, saying it was time to be ""pragmatic and realistic"".

Edwina Johnson, the senior official who led the overhaul of the beefed-up emissions safeguard mechanism, said the federal government was considering following Europe's lead in imposing a price on the carbon content of imported goods.

A so-called carbon border adjustment mechanism, or CBAM, could stop firms from shifting jobs to Indonesia and Malaysia where environmental standards are lower, and where ingredients for cement and steel - or future batteries - are cheaper.

A review of this ""carbon leakage"" and the feasibility of a CBAM, particularly for steel and cement, will report in a year's time.

But analysts warn that construction and housing costs will soar without cheap imports.

Chair of the new Net-Zero Economy Agency Greg Combet told the summit the task of decarbonising Australia's economy would require a level of investment and transformation equivalent to the period of post-war reconstruction.

Engineer Ben McGarry, global service leader of future energy at Aurecon, said technical people would be needed at worksites to figure out how to do it.

""One of my favourite cute factoids is that climate change is an anagram of mega technical,"" Dr McGarry said.

But in many cases the complex new technology behind ambitious decarbonisation plans does not yet exist, which means businesses must rely on carbon credits to comply with government requirements.

The purpose of carbon credits is widely misunderstood, according to summit host and Carbon Market Institute chief executive John Connor.

""I support efforts to give greater integrity to carbon crediting mechanisms, but they are not the enemy,"" Mr Connor said.

He said Australia should lift its game on emissions reduction and market integrity to support rapid change in the global economy.

However, there is growing scrutiny around how resources companies and other big emitters have access to unlimited carbon credits to meet climate promises, in what the fiercest opponents have called a ""scammer's dream"" or a ""fraud on the environment"".

Regulators have put firms on notice about false or misleading climate claims made to investors and consumers, particularly those that use offsets to wash emissions-rich business operations.

Deanne Stewart, chief executive of Aware Super, which manages $160 billion in superannuation accounts, said climate change was one of the biggest risks and there was a ""noisy minority"" who wanted no investment in fossil fuels.

""We really saw it dial-up when it was front and centre in the community when the bushfires and floods were happening,"" she said.

She said Aware Super used voting power on behalf of members to encourage ""laggards"" to disclose climate plans.

""We haven't done massive divestment at this point,"" Ms Stewart said.

""But as we get more and more forensic, and the sector pathways become more realistic, we'll start to move more into that action mode.""

EN_CC_100122.txt,Other,Other,"Your Connection to Nature 

 I grew up in New England, on a bluff overlooking the Connecticut River. We lived in a quiet town with a village green, a local dairy around the corner, and houses lining Main Street that were built in the mid-1700s.

Unlike the deep snows that blanket Vermont in the winter, we lived farther south, in an area known for legendary ice storms. It’s like the weather can’t make up its mind whether to rain or snow, so it rains—then decides to freeze.

When I was in high school, we had the mother of all ice storms. The frozen rain had left almost half an inch of ice on everything from roads and rooftops to the tiniest of twigs. The trees, unable to bear the weight of so much ice, lost branches or were ripped from the ground completely. The branches and felled trees blocked roads and pulled down power lines. We huddled in front of our fireplace, making meals on a camp stove for the better part of a week, without power or heat.

The ice clung stayed for several days. And then one evening, the mercury climbed from below-freezing to 50 degrees in a matter of hours. My dad and I went outdoors to watch the weather change, and because we lived on a hill, we could see what was happening across much of the Connecticut River Valley.

As the thermometer rapidly rose, the tons of ice began falling from the trees and rooftops with a deafening roar. The broken power lines thawed and then lit up the sky with dangerous blue explosions of electricity.

Dad and I watched in wonder as our frozen, ice-caked world thawed. He turned to me and said, “You’ll never forget this night for as long as you live.”

My dad has been gone now for almost two decades, but that evening, his comment, is how I like to remember him. The awe of Mother Nature was unforgettable. But it was also that my dad, a slide-rule-carrying engineer would fearlessly turn to his then-snotty teen-aged daughter and express his amazement and wonder of the world. That’s what I remember most.*

I choose to remember that evening, that moment in time when I think about my dad because it makes me smile. But it was also a profound moment because my father, who was a deeply religious man, was tacitly acknowledging that our connection with nature is also about our relationship with God or the universe or however you define the divine.

The point is that when you stop, observe, and admire the incredible operating system that is nature, how can you be anything but in awe? Nature has the ability to turn a tiny seed into a tree or an ear of corn, just by adding air, water, and sunlight. It keeps the oceans just the right amount of salinity to sustain the lives of fish and other aquatic animals. Our planet provides millions of species of plants, animals, and insects everything they need to survive.

And yet, we get caught up in our lives and often lose touch with nature for long periods of time. Long enough for critical habitat to be turned into parking lots and for rainforests to be cut down. Long enough for our air to become toxic, and for the Colorado River to run empty before it reaches the ocean.

I don’t pretend to have any answers, except for the baby step of reexamining your relationship with the natural world. Stop and listen to the birds, notice how moss looks like a tiny forest, wonder at the tenacity of those plants that grow through the cracks in the sidewalk, and be in awe at how trees know to leaf out in the spring.

Two climate activists disrupted the National Archives rotunda and galleries in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon. The perpetrators, identified as Donald Zepeda, 35, and Jackson Green, 27, both residents of Washington, D.C., dumped red powder on the case housing the U.S. Constitution, prompting an early closure of the premises to the public.


The National Archives, in a press release, reassured the public that the encasement shielded the Constitution from any harm. However, conservators are assessing the extent of the damage caused to the rotunda. The suspects were promptly apprehended and escorted out by security personnel.

The motive behind the act appears to be linked to climate change activism. A video circulating on social media captured the moment when the two men, drenched in red powder, delivered prepared speeches regarding Climate change while standing before the Constitution’s protective case.

“We are determined to foment a rebellion,” declared one of the men in the video. “We all deserve clean air, water, food, and a livable climate.” The group Declare Emergency, a Climate change activism organization, confirmed to NBC Washington that the detained individuals were indeed members of their movement.

Colleen Shogan, the Archivist of the United States, expressed deep concern over the violation of the sanctity of the National Archives Rotunda, emphasizing its significance as the repository of the nation’s founding documents.

“The National Archives Rotunda is the sanctuary for our nation’s founding documents. They are here for all Americans to view and understand the principles of our nation,” Shogan stated. “We take such vandalism very seriously and we will insist that the perpetrators be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

As a consequence of the disruption, the National Archives Rotunda will remain closed for cleaning on Thursday, while the rest of the building will continue to operate on its regular schedule.

 Warning US could be ‘hit with most debilitating strike EVER’ in space war with Russia after chilling ISS threat

THE US could be hit with the most debilitating and destructive strike ever in a potential space war with Russia, an expert warns.

Relations between Moscow and Washington have plunged to new lows amid the Ukrainian crisis, and Russia’s space agency warned that US sanctions could “destroy” cooperation on the International Space Station.

Moscow claimed Washington needs its cooperation to prevent the ISS from falling on the US or Europe.

Geopolitical and space expert Brandon J Weichert told The Sun that Moscow has a decade to a 12-year advantage on the US in the galaxies.

He said US defenses are in “no way fit” to deal with the challenges posed by Russia.

Weichert warned: “We are going to get hit very hard soon in space. It is going to be the most debilitating strike on America, possibly ever.

“And we may not recover from it in a timely fashion. This could be how we lose our first war on Earth is losing the war in space.”

Weichert slammed the ""arrogant"" DC political class, claiming they didn’t foresee any rival challenging Washington’s dominance in the post-Cold-War world.

He said: “They thought there would never be a need for any kind of preventative or security measure because we thought we would always be dominant, and we thought no one would be crazy enough to challenge us.

“Well here we are 30 years later, and you have Russia, China, North Korea, and even Iran showing us that it was the wrong assumption.”

The expert feared that the US has a 60 percent chance of being pushed out of space by its rivals completely.

President Biden unleashed a package of sanctions against Moscow on Thursday after Putin’s forces rolled into Ukraine.

And, an additional 7,000 troops will be sent to Eastern Europe to bolster Nato’s defenses.

Russia’s invasion of the besieged nation saw Europe plunged into its biggest crisis since World War II.

Experts claim the world has not seen a crisis since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s.

The flashpoint was the closest point the world came to a full-blown nuclear war.

US intelligence feared that Kyiv could fall within 96 hours and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said it’s a “possibility” that Putin could move beyond the borders of Ukraine.

The Russian strongman may feel emboldened and seek to move on to other nations if successful.

Troops have reportedly already been spotted in the Belarussian city of Brest – 10 miles east of the Polish border.

Biden told reporters Thursday: “He has much larger ambitions. He wants to, in fact, re-establish the former Soviet Union. That’s what this is all about.”

Weichert said: “If Putin suspects the West will prop up a formidable anti-Russian resistance in a post-invasion Ukraine, he will risk not only nuclear war but also will threaten to attack US assets in space and the ISS.

“Putin fully understands the concept of asymmetrical warfare.”

He speculated that Moscow will ramp up its threats in cyberspace and nuclear warfare.

PUTIN'S THREATS

In December, Weichert warned that Moscow is plotting to launch a Pearl Harbor attack on the US in the cosmos.

The Pearl Harbor attack of December 1941 left America reeling as Japanese forces bombed the US naval port.

In his book, Winning Space: How America Remains a Superpower, Weichert says that Russian co-orbital satellites, known as space stalkers, have been tailgating US satellites for years.

He predicts that the stalkers will eventually hit the satellites, sending them crashing into the ground.

Weichert believes Russia is preparing to launch a ""devastating"" attack on American satellites at the time of its own choice.

He warned that before launching an attack on Washington’s satellites, Moscow would ""engage in a series of escalations” with neighboring nations.

Russia conducted an anti-satellite weapon test (ASAT) in November where it destroyed one of its own satellites that had been in orbit since 1982.

Blinken branded the test ""dangerous and irresponsible"" as it created a field of 1,500 pieces of debris, forcing the ISS crew to take shelter.

State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the test marked an increase in the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS.

 COP28 President: There Is ""No Science"" Behind Calls For Fossil-Fuel Phase-Out

There is “no science” that says the world should phase out fossil fuels to curb global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to Sultan Al Jaber, the president of the COP28 climate summit, the Guardian and the Centre for Climate Reporting report.

“There is no science out there, or no scenario out there, that says that the phase-out of fossil fuel is what’s going to achieve 1.5C,” Al Jaber said in an online event last month, the remarks from which the Guardian reported on December 3, days after the COP28 summit in Dubai began on November 30.

Al Jaber made those comments in response to questions from Mary Robinson, the chair of the Elders group and a former UN special envoy for climate change.

[ZH: Additionally, The Guardian newspaper published video from the call on Sunday, which included al-Jaber off-camera sounding increasingly frustrated, at one point telling three leading women involved with climate change and gender: ""I am telling you I am the man in charge.”

“You’re asking for a phase-out of fossil fuel,"" al-Jaber said.

""Please, help me, show me for a phase-out of fossil fuel that will allow for sustainable socio-economic development, unless you want to take the world back into caves.”

Responding to the remark, U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen said she lives in Kenya with solar power and clean electricity from the local utility.

“I'm not living in a cave,"" she added.

""That's all I can say.”

The remarks from Al Jaber draw criticism from scientists and are in contrast with the view of Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, who said at the climate summit on Friday,

“The science is clear: The 1.5C limit is only possible if we ultimately stop burning all fossil fuels. Not reduce, not abate. Phase out, with a clear timeframe.”

Al Jaber’s presidency of COP28 has stirred controversy in recent months. He is the first CEO designated to be president of any climate summit so far. But he is also the chief executive of the national oil company of OPEC's third-largest producer, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

“The recent comments from COP28 President show how entrenched he is in fossil fuel fantasy and is clearly determined that this COP doesn’t do anything to harm the interests of the oil and gas industry,"" said Mohamed Adow, the director of Power Shift Africa.

“These remarks are a wake-up call to the world and negotiators at COP28 that they are not going to get any help from the COP presidency in delivering a strong outcome on a fossil fuel phase-out and will need to work hard to ensure a few petro-state leaders don’t imperil the planet in their efforts to protect their oil profits.""

Last week, Al Jaber denied reports of plans to use the climate summit in Dubai to push oil deals.

Earlier last week, the BBC and many other news outlets reported that the UAE planned to use its role as the host of climate talks to forge new oil and gas deals. The BBC cited leaked briefing documents obtained by independent journalists at the Centre for Climate Reporting working alongside the BBC. Those documents were purportedly prepared by the UAE’s COP28 team for meetings with at least 27 foreign governments during the climate summit which Dubai will host from November 30 to December 12.",EN,"['CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Greenhouse effect/carbon dioxide do not drive climate change', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",cop president science call fossil fuel phase cop president science call fossil fuel phase science say world phase fossil fuel curb global warming degree celsius accord sultan al jaber president cop climate summit guardian centre climate reporting report science scenario say phase fossil fuel go achieve .c al jaber say online event month remark guardian report december day cop summit dubai begin november al jaber comment response question mary robinson chair elder group un special envoy climate change zh additionally guardian newspaper publish video sunday include al jaber camera sound increasingly frustrated point tell lead woman involve climate change gender tell man charge ask phase fossil fuel al jaber say help phase fossil fuel allow sustainable socio economic development want world cave respond remark u.n environment program executive director inger andersen say live kenya solar power clean electricity local utility live cave add remark al jaber draw criticism scientist contrast view antonio guterre secretary general united nations say climate summit friday science clear .c limit possible ultimately stop burn fossil fuel reduce abate phase clear timeframe al jaber presidency cop stir controversy recent month ceo designate president climate summit far chief executive national oil company opec large producer united arab emirates uae recent comment cop president entrenched fossil fuel fantasy clearly determined cop doesn harm interest oil gas industry say mohame adow director power shift africa remark wake world negotiator cop go help cop presidency deliver strong outcome fossil fuel phase need work hard ensure petro state leader don imperil planet effort protect oil profit week al jaber deny report plan use climate summit dubai push oil deal early week bbc news outlet report uae plan use role host climate talk forge new oil gas deal bbc cite leak briefing document obtain independent journalist centre climate reporting work alongside bbc document purportedly prepare uae cop team meeting foreign government climate summit dubai host november december

 Virginia is ditching rules that would have mandated 100% of new car sales to be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2035.

Under former Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, the state enacted a law in 2021 that hitched it to California’s stringent vehicle emissions standards, the latest version of which will require the phase-out of internal combustion engine models by 2035. Current Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and his administration announced Wednesday that Virginia will not be following California’s new regulations once the current set expires at the end of the year.

“Once again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “The idea that government should tell people what kind of car they can or can’t purchase is fundamentally wrong. Virginians deserve the freedom to choose which vehicles best fit the needs of their families and businesses. The law is clear, and I am proud to announce Virginians will no longer be forced to live under this out-of-touch policy.” (RELATED: Glenn Youngkin And Virginia Universities Are In Bitter Battle Over Future Of Diversity, Equity And Inclusion On Campuses)

Once again, Virginia is declaring independence – this time from a misguided electric vehicle mandate imposed by unelected leaders nearly 3,000 miles away from the Commonwealth.

— Governor Glenn Youngkin (@GovernorVA) June 5, 2024

Youngkin has opposed the policy because “California’s requirements for their citizens should not be a one size fits all solution for Virginia,” the governor’s staff previously told to the Daily Caller News Foundation. Previous efforts by state Republicans to repeal the law linking Virginia to California’s standards failed, and legislative avenues to get rid of the rules closed when Democrats cemented control of the state legislature in last fall’s elections.

The governor’s office cited a legal opinion by Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares to substantiate its decision. Miyares’ opinion asserted that the state is not obligated to abide by the California Air Resource Board’s (CARB) Advanced Clean Cars II rules, which would have taken effect at the beginning of 2025 and required EVs to make up 35% of all new car sales starting in model year 2026 on the way to 100% by 2035.

“Given that EVs only amounted to 9% of vehicles sold in Virginia in 2023, application of the misguided mandates could have resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties,” Youngkin’s office said in the official announcement. “Virginia auto consumers and dealers could be forced to bear these costs. Not only would this leave auto dealers with less money to pay staff, offer raises, and grow their businesses, it could force many small auto dealers to permanently close their doors.”

Numerous Democrat-leaning or blue states have adopted CARB’s auto emissions standards, which are more stringent than federal standards, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Neither CARB nor the office of Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom responded immediately to requests for comment.

 Sweden says enough!

Sweden’s Prosecution Authority is bringing charges against none other than their homegrown eco-hoaxer, Greta Thunberg, for disobeying law enforcement during a climate protest in June.

The 20-year-old is facing potential fines or imprisonment of up to six months.

The charges stem from her involvement in a protest that allegedly led to major traffic disruption in Malmö in June, authorities said.

“The prosecutor has filed charges against a young woman who, on June 19 this year, participated in a climate demonstration which, according to the prosecution, caused disruption to traffic in Malmö,” the statement said. The woman “refused to obey the police command to leave the scene,” it added according to CNN.

While the prosecution authority’s statement did not specifically name Thunberg, a spokesperson for the Swedish Prosecution Authority, Annika Collin, confirmed to CNN that the individual referred to in the charges is indeed Greta Thunberg.

“The criminal classification is disobedience to law enforcement. According to the prosecutor, the act was committed with intent,” the prosecution authority’s statement added.

Irma Kjellström, a spokesperson for Ta Tillbaka Framtiden, told CNN that Thunberg was among several young people who participated in blocking the oil tankers.

Kjellström added, “After having blocked the industry which is burning our future, we have now been charged with crime. While charges are being brought against us, the real crime continues inside the gates that we blocked.”

Recently, Greta Thunberg was back in the news after her prediction that the world would end in 2023 was a conspiracy.

On June 21, 2018, she made a bold claim on Twitter, stating that humanity had a narrow five-year window to stop the use of fossil fuels or face inevitable extinction.

“A top climate scientist is warning that climate change will wipe out all of humanity unless we stop using fossil fuels over the next five years.”

Thunberg shared a now-deleted Grit Post article by Scott Alden citing a prediction from James Anderson, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at Harvard University, titled, “Top Climate Scientist: Humans Will Go Extinct if We Don’t Fix Climate Change by 2023.”",EN,['CC: Criticism of climate movement'],['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Ad hominem attacks on key activists'],climate change hoaxer greta thunberg charge disobey law enforcement sweden climate protest face month prison sweden say sweden prosecution authority bring charge homegrown eco hoaxer greta thunberg disobey law enforcement climate protest june -year old face potential fine imprisonment month charge stem involvement protest allegedly lead major traffic disruption malmö june authority say prosecutor file charge young woman june year participate climate demonstration accord prosecution cause disruption traffic malmö statement say woman refuse obey police command leave scene add accord cnn prosecution authority statement specifically thunberg spokesperson swedish prosecution authority annika collin confirm cnn individual refer charge greta thunberg criminal classification disobedience law enforcement accord prosecutor act commit intent prosecution authority statement add irma kjellström spokesperson ta tillbaka framtiden tell cnn thunberg young people participate block oil tanker kjellström add having block industry burn future charge crime charge bring real crime continue inside gate block recently greta thunberg news prediction world end conspiracy june bold claim twitter state humanity narrow year window stop use fossil fuel face inevitable extinction climate scientist warn climate change wipe humanity stop fossil fuel year thunberg share delete grit post article scott alden cite prediction james anderson professor atmospheric chemistry harvard university title climate scientist human extinct don fix climate change

 Global Warming fraud Al Gore made a new ‘climate change’ prediction “once we get to true net zero.”

Net-zero emissions is a front for global Communism. “Net zero” will be reached when the world completely ‘eliminates carbon emissions’ and we go back to the dark ages. Only the global elites will continue to live in their mansions, eat meat, and fly in private jets.

Al Gore made the new Global Warming prediction from Davos as he sat outside in the freezing cold weather with a snowy backdrop.

“The good news is that once we get to true net zero and stop adding, the temperatures will stop going up almost immediately, with a lag of as little as three years,” Al Gore said without providing any evidence whatsoever to back up his new timeline.

Gore continued, “And if we stay at true net zero half of the human cause to greenhouse gas pollution will fall out of the atmosphere in as little as 25 to 30 years, but getting there is very tough.”

On December 13, 2008, junk scientist Al Gore predicted the North Polar Ice Cap would be completely ice-free in five years.

And, with this lie, the global warming hysteria began.

Gore made the prediction to a German audience on December 13, 2008. Al warned them that “the entire North ‘polarized’ cap will disappear in 5 years.” The Gateway Pundit reported on this at the time.

This wasn’t the only time Al Gore made his ice-free prediction. Gore had been predicting the dire scenario since 2007. That means that the North Pole should have melted completely over a decade ago by now.

Al Gore also made the same prediction in 2009.

EN_UA_014014.txt,Other,Other,"End overseas trade settlement in dollar, use your own currency: Brazil President Lula to BRICS nations 

 Beijing: Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has called for the BRICS nations to give up US dollar and come up with their own alternative currency to settle cross-border trade.

During his first state visit to China since taking office in January, Lula also lashed out the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and criticised the outsize role of the greenback in global trade.

His comments came mere days after the Brazilian government ditched dollar as an intermediary and announced a deal to trade in local currency with China.

Lula voices for de-dollarization

Lending his voice to China’s efforts to shed the dollar’s dominance and promote the use of the renminbi (RMB)/ yuan in overseas trade settlement, the Brazilian President said: “Who was it that decided that the dollar was the currency after the disappearance of the gold standard?”

“Why can’t we do trade based on our own currencies?” he said during his address at the New Development Bank in Shanghai, known as the “BRICS bank”.

“Every night I ask myself why all countries have to base their trade on the dollar,” Lula added.

It is being said that at the BRICS annual summit in South Africa, the member countries – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – will create a new currency to facilitate overseas trade. The final agreement could come up as early as in August this year.

As per reports, Russia is behind the idea of the alternative currency as it continues to face economic sanctions from the West over its invasion of Ukraine.

Don’t chase dollars

“Why can’t a bank like the BRICS bank have a currency to finance trade between Brazil and China, between Brazil and other BRICS countries?… Today, countries have to chase after dollars to export, when they could be exporting in their own currencies,"" Lula said.

Hitting out at the IMF, Lula alluded to accusations the global lenders’ overly harsh spending cuts on cash-strapped countries like Brazil’s neighbour Argentina in exchange for bailout loans.

“No bank should be asphyxiating countries’ economies the way the IMF is doing now with Argentina, or the way they did with Brazil for a long time and every third-world country,"" he said.

“No leader can work with a knife to their throat because (their country) owes money,"" he added.

Brazil-China trade

Trade between Brazil and China soared over the past decade to $150.4 billion in 2022.

China imports agricultural commodities and minerals from Brazil apart from investing in the Latin American country’s consumer market and infrastructure sector.

Earlier this week, the Brazilian branch of the state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China settled its first overseas transaction directly in RMB in the country. With the increase in bilateral trade and growing economic relationship, both countries have now been using their respective currencies to settle payments.

Can yuan be the new dollar?

The Chinese yuan’s role in trade finance has more than doubled since the Ukraine war, but at present, it is a poor contender to replace the US dollar as the global currency.

Not only is it virtually pegged to the dollar, China’s tight control of its currency keeps it from adhering to free market flows.

EN_UA_300005.txt,Other,Other,"Meloni betrays Orbán? Italian press reports she rejected Hungary’s Fidesz party joining the ECR group in the EU parliament 

 A report from Italy claims that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has rejected Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s efforts to join the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament.

Meloni is currently serving as leader of the group, which is made up of a wide range of conservative and center-right parties across Europe. However, according to Italian press outlet Corriere della Sera, Meloni sees more disadvantages than advantages to Orbán joining the group.

One of the main sticking points is Orbán’s pro-peace position on the war in Ukraine. He remains opposed to sending weapons to Ukraine and is calling for an immediate ceasefire; in contrast, Meloni is pushing for more weapons and continued war against Russia, which has made her somewhat of a darling of the Brussels elite, who see her as someone they can work with, including on the issue of migration.

Meloni herself has taken a notable U-turn on the issue of migration, calling for more legal migration to Italy and overseeing a huge increase in illegal migration under her rule.

Meloni is looking to grow the ECR from the sixth-largest grouping in the EU parliament to the third largest. Among the parties belonging to the group are Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS), who have also shunned Orbán’s views on the war in Ukraine. The stance of other parties may have also played a role in Meloni’s decision to exclude Orbán from the group.

It is unclear how Orbán and his Fidesz party will react to Meloni’s rejection. So far, only Corriere della Sera has reported on the issue, but there has been no denial from either camp over the issue.

 The Eurocrats Fear That Fico's Attempted Assassination Will Influence Next Month's Elections

Authored by Andrew Korybko via Substack,

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned last week that Russia will ramp up its meddling ahead of next month’s parliamentary elections, which preceded European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova assessing that they’d be a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience. This speculation is nothing new, but what’s different this time around is that the attempted assassination of Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico will be on every voter’s mind, thus likely influencing the outcome.

The preceding hyperlinked analysis argued that fake news was responsible for radicalizing the pro-Ukrainian suspect into thinking that shooting his premier was a legitimate form of protest against what he’d been misled by the media into believing was his “pro-Russian dictator with blood on his hands”. This black swan event might have served the short-term interests of that leader’s many enemies, but the blowback could be considerable if it leads to a conservative landslide during next month’s elections.

Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban predicted that the upcoming vote will influence the direction of war and peace in Europe, and while the European Parliament admittedly can’t do much in terms of shaping the NATO-Russian proxy war in Ukraine, it could still exert positive pressure if conservatives win. It’s with that in mind that Eurocrats like von der Leyen and Jourova are fearmongering about Russian meddling since they want to preemptively discredit this potential outcome.

To be sure, the first of those two had no idea that an assassination attempt would be made against Fico the day after she shared her earlier mentioned warning, but the second’s assessment about the upcoming elections being a test of the bloc’s disinformation resilience came some days later. Instead of speaking vaguely about alleged Russian meddling, the Eurocrats are now honing their information warfare narrative to muddle the conversation about Fico’s attempted assassination and its political aftermath.

The targeted audience is the unclear number of on-the-fence voters who might usually lean liberal but have recently begun to sympathize with some conservative positions on issues like Ukraine. Last week’s incident was driven by the liberal media’s fake news about the Slovak leader, which might influence some of these voters to give the more narratively responsible conservatives their support. In an attempt to desperately prevent this, the Eurocrats want them think that it would be doing Russia’s bidding.

If the European Parliamentary elections have absolutely no effect on anything, then they wouldn’t care who votes for whom, but the outcome will clearly at the very least have a major impact on popular perceptions and could lead to cascading consequences like more anti-war protests across the bloc. It’s for this reason that the Eurocrats and their media allies, including those being promoted by state-run Ukrainian outlets like this one here, are pushing the abovementioned information warfare narrative.

The growing gap between liberals and conservatives over Ukraine, which is foreign policy issue that Fico was most closely associated with, is naturally occurring as a result of their polar opposite worldviews and not due to Russian meddling. It’s so emotive and significant that some from both sides have become single-issue voters who’ll cast their ballots purely based on candidates’ positions towards this.

EN_UA_300133.txt,Other,Other,"Cash-strapped Pakistan sold weapons worth $364 million to Ukraine via US companies: Report 

 Cash-strapped Pakistan made $364 million last year from a weapons agreement with two private US businesses to provide ammunition to Ukraine in its conflict with Russia, according to a report.

According to BBC Urdu report published on Monday, a British military cargo plane flew from Pakistan Air Force Base Nur Khan in Rawalpindi to the British military base in Cyprus, Akrotiri, and then to Romania a total of five times to supply arms to the war-torn country.

Islamabad has, however, consistently denied that it has provided any ammunition to Ukraine, a neighbouring country to Romania.

The BBC story asserted that Pakistan had inked two contracts for the supply of 155mm rounds with American companies Global Military and Northrop Grumman, citing contract details from the US Federal Procurement Data System.

These arms deals with Ukraine were signed on 17 August, 2022, and they were particularly related to the acquisition of 155mm ammunition.

The Foreign Office in Islamabad has denied any sale of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, saying that Pakistan maintained a policy of strict neutrality in the dispute between the two countries and did not provide them with any arms or ammunition in that context.

These alleged agreements took place during the rule of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) - a multi-party coalition that ousted Imran Khan-led government through a no-trust vote in April last year.

Then Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had pledged to take Pakistan-UK relations to a “new height”, retired in November 2022.

In August 2022, when these alleged contracts were signed, the Ukraine crisis was very much a part of the political discourse in Pakistan, particularly in the wake of the cricketer-turned-politician Khan’s visit to Russia on February 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an invasion of Ukraine.

Months after the visit, Gen Bajwa publicly distanced from Khan and called for the invasion to be stopped immediately.

During a visit to Pakistan this July, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba also rejected reports that Pakistan was supplying arms to Ukraine to support its military during the ongoing conflict with Russia.

The BBC Urdu report claimed that a $232 million contract was awarded to Global Military while another $131 million contract was signed with Northrop Grumman. “These agreements expired last month i.e. October 2023, it added.

The report alleged that the deliveries were made in a British military cargo plane from the Nur Khan Air Base, which landed in Rawalpindi five times.

The first such plane landed in Rawalpindi in August 2022.

“Each time, the plane flew from Nur Khan Airbase to the British military base in Cyprus and then to Romania, that too at a time when Russia was waging war in Romania’s neighbouring country Ukraine, the report claimed.

BBC Urdu, while citing further evidence for its claims, said data by the State Bank of Pakistan also showed that the country’s arms exports increased by 3,000 per cent during FY 2022-23.

“Pakistan exported arms worth $13 million in 2021-22, while these exports reached $415 million in 2022-23,” it said.

Earlier reports said secret Pakistani arms sales to the US to be used by Ukraine helped cash-strapped Islamabad secure a crucial International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout earlier this year.

The arms sales were made for the purpose of supplying the Ukrainian military marking Pakistani involvement in a conflict it had faced US pressure to take sides on.

Pakistan’s Foreign Office Spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, however, rejected as baseless and fabricated the report which says the cash-strapped country provided arms to the US to get its support to clinch the USD 3 billion deal with the IMF towards the end of June to avoid default.

EN_UA_300142.txt,Other,Other,"Former Top FBI Official Pleads Guilty in Scheme to Help Russian Oligarch 

 A former high-ranking FBI counterintelligence official pleaded guilty on Tuesday to conspiracy and money laundering as he admitted to working for a Russian oligarch he once investigated after leaving the agency. His actions violated the sanctions against Russia.

Expressing deep remorse, Charles McGonigal pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to one count of conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) for the purpose of money laundering.

According to testimony before Judge Jennifer H. Rearden, Mr. McGonigal committed his violation of the IEEPA during the spring and fall of 2021, when he accepted over $17,000 to assist Russian energy mogul Oleg Deripaska by gathering negative information about one of Deripaska’s competitors.

Sentencing is set Dec. 14 for Mr. McGonigal, 55, who could spend up to five years in prison.

“After his tenure as a high-level FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of Russian oligarchs, Charles McGonigal has now admitted that he agreed to evade U.S. sanctions by providing services to one of those oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska,“ U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, according to the press release. ”This Office will continue to hold to account those who violate U.S. sanctions for their own financial benefit.”

Mr. Williams lauded the exceptional performance of the FBI New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division as well as the assistance provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the New York City Police Department.

The Former Agent’s PositionFrom 2016 to 2018, Mr. McGonigal oversaw the FBI’s counterintelligence operations in New York as special agent in charge. He directed probes of Russian oligarchs such as Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury in 2018.

In 2018, Washington banned nearly two dozen Russian billionaires and government officials in response to the now-debunked allegations of collusion between then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. Among those targeted was Mr. Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminum firm Rusal.

Mr. Deripaska’s sanctions were upheld by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the court found evidence he had acted as an agent for Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Mr. McGonigal, who wept as he spoke about his crime, said Mr. Deripaska had sent him at least $17,000 via a bank in Cypress and a firm in New Jersey before depositing the money into his bank account.

In January 2023, authorities alleged that Mr. McGonigal had received undisclosed payments from Mr. Deripaska in exchange for investigating a rival oligarch and unsuccessfully pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on the Russian billionaire.

According to a news release issued by the Department of Justice on Jan. 23, it was alleged that Mr. McGonigal, on behalf of Mr. Deripaska, “fraudulently used a U.S. entity to obscure their activity in violation of U.S. sanctions.”

Connection to TrumpMr. McGonigal joined the FBI in 1996 and worked on Russian foreign counterintelligence and organized crime before taking part in probes into the crash of TWA Flight 800, the 1998 terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

In 2016, he was promoted to head of the FBI’s New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division.

The DOJ was able to monitor Mr. Page’s communications because of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant issued during President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Former Department of Justice assertions that Mr. Page was “collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government” and had been the target of Russian intelligence recruitment efforts have since been debunked.

Mr. Page has always denied any collusion with the Russian government and has never been indicted in the Trump campaign probes.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],fbi official plead guilty scheme help russian oligarch high rank fbi counterintelligence official plead guilty tuesday conspiracy money laundering admit work russian oligarch investigate leave agency action violate sanction russia express deep remorse charles mcgonigal plead guilty manhattan federal court count conspire violate international emergency economic power act ieepa purpose money laundering accord testimony judge jennifer h. rearden mr mcgonigal commit violation ieepa spring fall accept assist russian energy mogul oleg deripaska gather negative information deripaska competitor sentencing set dec mr mcgonigal spend year prison tenure high level fbi official supervise participate investigation russian oligarch charles mcgonigal admit agree evade u.s sanction provide service oligarchs oleg deripaska u.s attorney damian williams say accord press release office continue hold account violate u.s sanction financial benefit mr williams laud exceptional performance fbi new york field office counterintelligence division assistance provide u.s customs border protection new york city police department agent positionfrom mr mcgonigal oversee fbi counterintelligence operation new york special agent charge direct probe russian oligarch deripaska sanction office foreign asset control united states department treasury washington ban nearly dozen russian billionaire government official response debunk allegation collusion candidate donald trump presidential campaign russian government target mr deripaska founder russian aluminum firm rusal mr deripaska sanction uphold u.s district court district columbia court find evidence act agent russian president vladimir putin mr mcgonigal weep speak crime say mr deripaska send bank cypress firm new jersey deposit money bank account january authority allege mr mcgonigal receive undisclosed payment mr deripaska exchange investigate rival oligarch unsuccessfully push lift u.s sanction russian billionaire accord news release issue department justice jan allege mr mcgonigal behalf mr deripaska fraudulently u.s entity obscure activity violation u.s sanction connection trumpmr mcgonigal join fbi work russian foreign counterintelligence organized crime take probe crash twa flight terrorist bombing kenya tanzania sept attack world trade center pentagon promote head fbi new york field office counterintelligence division doj able monitor mr page communication foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa warrant issue president trump campaign department justice assertion mr page collaborate conspire russian government target russian intelligence recruitment effort debunk mr page deny collusion russian government indict trump campaign probe
EN_UA_101067.txt,Other,Other,"First war of TikTok era sees tragedy, humor and deceit 

 eart-rending videos of artillery strikes are being served up alongside funny snippets such as bomb-shelter cooking tips and invasion misinformation as the war in Ukraine plays out on TikTok.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine, millions of people have tuned into the hugely popular social networking service for news and views of what is happening on the battleground.

That was not lost on United States officials who hosted a video call to brief popular TikTok ""influencers"" on details about the war, according to posts at the social network.

""Lots of people have been turning to digital creators to learn about the invasion of Ukraine,"" read a tweet Friday by Gen-Z for Change, a nonprofit focused on using social media to promote civil discourse.

""Yesterday, we joined the @WhiteHouse and @WHNSC for a briefing on the United States' strategic goals in Ukraine so we're better able to debunk misinformation,"" it added, referring to the White House National Security Council.

After Russia invaded Ukraine, music-themed video clips in Marta Vasyuta's account gave way to images of soldiers and the ravages of war.

Stuck in London, the 20-year-old Ukrainian exchange student uses TikTok to share glimpses of the tragedy inflicted on people still in her home country.

""My mission is to spread information, to not stop talking about that, because it really matters,"" said the economics student from Lviv, whose videos have logged millions of views.

Valeria Shashenok stayed in the city of Cherniguiv, northeast of Kyiv, and switched to English to broaden the reach of her sometimes surreal wartime TikTok posts.

In one, she shows how to cook borscht in a bomb shelter. In another, she walks through rubble to a Rihanna music remix.

The 20-year-old photographer is among those who have not given up on the playful nature of videos considered a trademark of TikTok, which boasts more than 1 billion users.

""I try to keep the humor, because it is my nature,"" said 23-year-old TikTok creator Rimma, who asked for her second name to be withheld.

""I'm living through this trauma. My life is ruined, and there is nothing left for me but irony.""

Her TikTok clips include one of her in a basement in Odessa, quipping that Ukrainians' idea of going for a walk now is a jaunt to the nearest shelter.

She said the line between what was funny and what was hurtful was no longer clear, given the suffering and fear afflicting so many.

But the appetite for wartime content at TikTok appears strong, with Vasyuta and Shashenok seeing their accounts’ subscriber ranks multiply.

Youthful sass

While breaking news events such as armed conflicts have featured on social media for years, TikTok tends to feature spontaneity and a bit of sass that has proven particularly popular with younger audiences.

In the US where members of Gen Z, born in the late 1990s, shun traditional television, online platforms like TikTok are prime sources of news.

""I hope that the kids who watch this war unfold on TikTok become opposed to war [and] realize the horrors and dangers of it,"" said US high school history teacher Chris Dier, who is also a TikTok creator.

""What I don't want is for it to desensitize them and normalize war.""

Young TikTok users were also being ""bombarded"" with propaganda that they likely needed help navigating, said Dier.

TikTok told AFP that it had ramped up resources to detect and counter ""emerging threats"" and ""harmful disinformation"" on the platform.

On March 6, the subsidiary of China-based ByteDance suspended the uploading of videos in Russia in reaction to a new law making it a crime to ""discredit"" the Russian military.

The flow of pro-Russian messages has noticeably declined at TikTok, with the most popular account being state-backed news agency RIA Novosti, which is known for false or discredited claims, such as the alleged existence of secret bioweapons labs in Ukraine.

EN_CC_300052.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Costa Rica’s Sea Turtle Decline Linked to Climate Change 

 The effects of climate change are increasingly evident in various parts of the planet. In Costa Rica, the impact is apparent due to high temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and now the decline in sea turtle hatchlings.

Experts from the APM Terminals Turtle Conservation Program, which protects sea turtle eggs and releases hatchlings on the beach that spans from the mouth of the Moín river to the mouth of the Matina River, have determined that this year the number of hatchlings and turtle releases in Moín will reach 10,000. In contrast, in 2022, approximately 30,000 turtles were released.

Climate change and its repercussions, such as rising sea levels, high sea temperatures, and shifts in migration and feeding patterns, are resulting in fewer hatchlings.

“There’s a decrease in turtle births on all nesting beaches from the Guajira Peninsula in Colombia to southern Nicaragua. We are monitoring data related to conditions exacerbated by and associated with climate change, such as warm waters in the North Atlantic that produce less food, and hot beaches with temperatures exceeding 34° Celsius, leading to infertile nests,” said Didiher Chacón, a specialist in Marine Sciences and the director of the Latin American Sea Turtles Association.

Risk factors

Climate change presents challenges that threaten the development of fertile turtle eggs and the births of leatherback, green, and hawksbill turtles.

For instance, sea turtles exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination. During incubation, the temperature determines whether the offspring will be male or female. Rising temperatures are producing more female turtles, thereby reducing the chances of reproduction.

Furthermore, the rise in sea levels, due to glacier melting and the thermal expansion of the oceans, results in a loss of nesting and feeding habitats for sea turtles. Nesting beaches may erode or become submerged, limiting the available space for turtles to nest.

Marine species rely on ocean currents and water temperatures for their migrations. Climate change can disrupt these patterns, affecting the availability of food and altering the migration routes of sea turtles.

Moreover, climate change can influence the availability and distribution of the turtles’ prey. Fluctuations in water temperatures and ocean acidification can destabilize marine ecosystems, thereby impacting the quantity and quality of food sources for sea turtles.

Didiher Chacón emphasized that people can help the cause through actions such as abstaining from consuming turtle eggs, participating in volunteer programs aimed at nest protection, cleaning beaches, minimizing their greenhouse gas emissions, recycling to curtail the demand for plastics, and educating the younger generations about these measures.",EN,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],costa rica sea turtle decline link climate change effect climate change increasingly evident part planet costa rica impact apparent high temperature change rainfall pattern decline sea turtle hatchling expert apm terminal turtle conservation program protect sea turtle egg release hatchling beach span mouth moín river mouth matina river determine year number hatchling turtle release moín reach contrast approximately turtle release climate change repercussion rise sea level high sea temperature shift migration feed pattern result few hatchling decrease turtle birth nest beach guajira peninsula colombia southern nicaragua monitor datum relate condition exacerbate associate climate change warm water north atlantic produce food hot beach temperature exceed celsius lead infertile nest say didiher chacón specialist marine science director latin american sea turtles association risk factor climate change present challenge threaten development fertile turtle egg birth leatherback green hawksbill turtle instance sea turtle exhibit temperature dependent sex determination incubation temperature determine offspring male female rise temperature produce female turtle reduce chance reproduction furthermore rise sea level glaci melting thermal expansion ocean result loss nesting feed habitat sea turtle nesting beach erode submerge limit available space turtle nest marine specie rely ocean current water temperature migration climate change disrupt pattern affect availability food alter migration route sea turtle climate change influence availability distribution turtle prey fluctuation water temperature ocean acidification destabilize marine ecosystem impact quantity quality food source sea turtle didiher chacón emphasize people help cause action abstain consume turtle egg participate volunteer program aim nest protection clean beach minimize greenhouse gas emission recycle curtail demand plastic educate young generation measure
EN_UA_300150.txt,Other,Other,"Kissinger says didn't want Ukraine to join NATO fearing a war, but that's an 'appropriate outcome' now 

 Davos: Henry Kissinger who feared a war over Ukraine’s NATO membership now calls it “appropriate outcome”. The former US Secretary of State, who is on the notorious Ukrainian “kill list”, addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, via video link. He said, “Before this war, I was opposed to the membership of Ukraine in NATO, because I feared it would start exactly the process that we have seen.” “Now, that this process has reached this level, the idea of a neutral Ukraine under these conditions is no longer meaningful,” he added. 

Kissinger said he wanted to express admiration for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the “heroic conduct of the Ukrainian people”. However, in no time, he went on to propose the same peace deal that he had put forward at Davos in May last year during which the former US Secretary of State advocated an urgent end to hostilities in Ukraine, lest Russia is “driven into a permanent alliance with China."" US should support Ukraine Kissinger argued that the US should continue to support and if required, intensify its military support for war-torn Ukraine until a ceasefire line is reached, or accepted, at preliminary talks with Russia. 

He also said the peace talks should begin once Ukrainian forces had reclaimed the territories occupied by Russia since the invasion began on February 24, 2022. Kissinger’s way to prevent escalation of conflict Kissinger said the only way to prevent the conflict from escalating is to do “exactly” what Ukraine, the US and its allies have been doing till now: “demand a Russian withdrawal, while Ukraine military and financial aid and maintaining sanctions and other pressures” on Moscow. 

He said that the destruction of Russia as a state that can pursue its own policies “will open up the vast area of its 11 time zones to internal conflict and to outside intervention at the time when there are 15,000 and more nuclear weapons on its territory.” “So this is why I believe in dialogue with Russia while the war continues, an end of fighting when the pre-war line is reached, and a continuing process of discussion by Europe, America and at that point Russia … while the conditions of sanctions and other pressures will be maintained until a final settlement is reached,” he added. Russia should be given ‘opening’ to rejoin the West Kissinger argued that Russia must be given an “opening” to rejoin the West, “if it meets the required conditions to participate as a member in these European processes"". 

He further said that the move could be important to avoid the perception that the conflict has become “against Russia itself,” which may cause Russians to re-evaluate both their historic “attraction to the culture of Europe and a fear of domination by Europe.” Kissinger also said the military alliance led by the US ought to be the guarantor of the final peace settlement “in whatever forms NATO can develop."" 

Who is Henry Kissinger? Aged 99, Kissinger was the US secretary of state between 1973-1977 under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He also served as the national security advisor between 1969 and 1975. He was a crucial part of the US detente with the Soviet Union and rapprochement with China. Kissinger also played a pivotal role in the talks to end the Vietnam War.

 To the Editor:

It is refreshing to know that some school districts have voters with the common sense to apply their limited resources to issues that might matter for climate change, such as continuing to develop renewable sources of energy (wind, solar, geothermal, etc.) — or maybe just buy food for their family — rather than spend those funds on electric school buses. (”NY’s school bus dilemma: Some voters tap brakes on switch to electric vehicles,” July 29, 2024).

We 20 million New Yorkers should continue to oppose these types of programs and the rules and regulations (i.e., a gas stove ban!) that will cost each of us money but have negligible effect on climate change. Many of the 8 billion inhabitants of this planet will continue to use organic sources to cook, heat, drive and survive. They have little access to an electric infrastructure that will allow them to do otherwise.

Our own infrastructure may not support the change that some envision without costly upgrades. We definitely need to be a little cautious before paying for first-class accommodations on the climate change train, as noted in an Aug. 1 Wall Street Journal commentary by Bjorn Lomborg, “Polar Bears, Dead Coral and other Climate Fictions.” It notes that many of the dire predictions promoted by the climate lobby are simply not true.

Renewable energy resources are a good thing and, with time and with good policies, we will get there. Eliminating our oil and gas infrastructure in New York with costly rules and regulations may satisfy the climate change enthusiasts and their political cronies but will do nothing for climate change itself.

Dr. David J. Seeley

 Zelensky Exposed: Former Advisor Reveals How Ukrainian President Thinks He's Omnipotent

Authored by Grzegorz Adamczyk via Remix News,

The arrogance of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is causing problems with Kyiv’s allies and he believes that, as his country is at war, he can do anything, his former adviser has claimed.

In a bombshell interview with Polish news outlet dorzeczy.pl, Oleksyi Arestovych slammed his former boss for his increasingly overbearing behavior and believes he has fallen victim to delusions of grandeur and a belief that he is all-powerful.

Arestovych cited Zelensky’s response to the ongoing diplomatic conflict over the dumping of Ukrainian grain as an example, accusing the president’s office of “behaving as if it has a decisive voice in the European Union rather than being a country aspiring to join the bloc.”

The former adviser, who himself is a possible candidate in any future Ukrainian presidential election, expressed his fear that Zelensky “has become deluded into thinking he now rules the globe.”

His diplomacy concentrates on making demands and using moral blackmail to claim Ukraine is fighting for the West, said Arestovych, who claimed this tactic may have been successful at the beginning of the conflict but is no longer effective.

“The West is increasingly irritated by Ukraine’s arrogance,” he added.

Arestovych claimed that Zelensky’s behavior had led to tension among Kyiv’s closest allies including Poland and Romania, while its relations with the U.S. and the U.K. have also cooled.

The West will continue to support Ukraine because it is in the West’s own interests to do so, but it may well stop supporting the current Ukrainian government and back an alternative, he warned.

However, Arestovych was dismissive of the argument that Ukraine was colluding with Germany against Poland, claiming that this is only purely due to the fact that Ukraine has no clear foreign policy under Zelensky.

Ukraine wants Germany to be a counter-balance to Russia and that is why Ukraine backs its ambitions of securing a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, the former advisor told the Polish news outlet.

Arestovych admitted that Poland could have gotten more out of Ukraine on issues related to the Volhynia massacre by pursuing a more transactional policy towards the country, but that would not have been beneficial to it in the longer term. “Even if Zelensky is ungrateful for all the help selflessly offered by Poland, Ukrainian people are grateful and that will be more important in the longer term,” he assured.

 Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen does not live in reality. She is not a trusted source of information but rather a Deep State puppet who pushes propaganda unsuccessfully. Yellen wants you to believe that America’s economy is stronger than ever with unlimited funds for all besides the actual citizens who pay taxes.


When asked if America could fund two major wars, Yellen told Sky News, “Absolutely!”.

“America can certainly afford to stand with Israel and to support Israel’s military needs, and we also can and must support Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The American economy is doing extremely well,” Yellen said.

The US national debt is now at $33.56 trillion with a defense budget of around $800 billion. We are funding layaway wars with no intention of ever paying back a penny to our debtors. They may strategize war, but they’re not strategizing war from an economic standpoint.

China was the largest purchaser of US debt but they have been abandoning US debt and the dollar entirely.

Yellen called the US debt downgrade “arbitrary” when Fitch Ratings downgraded US long-term debt late from AAA to AA+. The agency cited the debt ceiling negotiations and frequent government shutdowns as one of the reasons for the downgrade, and this was prior to the US losing its Speaker of the House for the first time in history.

Another reason is simply that China is disinvesting in the dollar.

The $2 billion sent to Israel is merely the beginning since the full-scale war has not yet begun. The two wars will merge into one when other nations become involved.

Israel could easily defeat Palestine on its own without foreign aid. But once the major players like China and Russia intervene it will take the full force and funding of NATO.

War has become the #1 economic priority for America’s politicians. “We” do not want to fund any wars but have no say in the matter since the elections are rigged, the data is inaccurate, and the truth is concealed by lie after lie.

‘Public opinion in the West is now built very clearly: everyone adheres to the idea that Russia is absolute evil, and the West is absolute good,’ says Italian artist Jorit Agoch.

With the beginning of the special operation in Ukraine, the Russian people in the West faced a substantial wave of Russophobia, which also swept the arts and sports.

Russian singers, artists and directors are finding their names crossed out from concert schedules and festival shortlists. The Munich Philharmonic Orchestra severed all relations with conductor Valery Gergiev, and the Carnegie Hall in New York cancelled performances by pianist Denis Matsuev.

Even those who are dead - Dostoevsky, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich - became victims of Russophobia, and this list is growing every day.

How does Russian culture withstand this wave of aggression? Watch the film Killing Russian Culture.

 Erdogan – Moscow and Kiev agree exchange of 200 prisoners

Russia releases captured Western mercenary fighters – Reuters

Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has mediated the release by Russia of ten foreign combatants in the Ukraine conflict, Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry announced on Wednesday. Hailing from five countries, the mercenaries had been captured while fighting for Kiev.

The prisoners, who are citizens of Croatia, Morocco, Sweden, the UK and the US, were transferred from Russia to Saudi Arabia by Saudi authorities, according to a statement from the ministry. Saudi officials are now “facilitating procedures for their safe return to their respective countries,” the announcement continued.

Bin Salman personally negotiated the release, which took place as part of a wider exchange of prisoners of war between Russia and Ukraine, the ministry added.

The full details of the POW exchange are unclear, but Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday that Moscow and Kiev had agreed to exchange 200 prisoners. This exchange would be the largest such swap since Russia’s military operation in Ukraine began in February.

Erdogan, whose government helped broker a deal earlier this summer to restart grain shipments from Ukrainian ports, said this exchange represented “a very important step.”

In addition to receiving tens of billions of dollars worth of Western arms, Ukraine has leaned heavily on foreign mercenaries to bolster its military. According to Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu, more than 2,000 of these foreign fighters have been eliminated by Russian troops and the militias of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics.

Shoigu said on Wednesday that just over 1,000 foreigners remain active in the ranks of the Ukrainian military. The Russian minister added that more than 150 NATO officers and advisers are in Kiev, where they are planning and commanding Ukraine’s forces.

EN_UA_300029.txt,Other,Other,"Ukraine war may bring windfall to Indonesia's trade balance 

 he Ukraine and Russia crisis is expected to have a positive impact on Indonesia's trade, with most of the country’s exports benefiting from surging commodity prices.

Indonesia’s top exports include crude palm oil (CPO), coal and metals like aluminum, copper and nickel, all of which have seen price surges in the weeks following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The two Eastern European countries are also big exporters of coal and these metals.

At the same time, Indonesia is a big importer of crude oil and certain food commodities, such as wheat and soybeans. The two Eastern European countries are also big on some of these commodities.

“This is the consequence of becoming a net exporter of commodities. Despite the hike in oil prices, we are still gaining amid the ongoing crisis in Eastern Europe,” said David Sumual, chief economist at Bank Central Asia (BCA), Indonesia's largest private lender, on March 11.

Global commodity prices have been rising this year as the global economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, but the price spike has been exacerbated by the war raging in Eastern Europe. Prices of nickel, coal and aluminum, as well as agricultural commodities like wheat, have surged to multiyear highs, with some hitting all-time peaks.

Coal prices passed US$439 per ton on March 8, a fivefold increase from last year, according to Business Insider data. The same data also shows that CPO reached 8,163 ringgit ($1,939) per ton on March 1, almost doubling from the same period last year. The two commodities alone account for around a quarter of Indonesia's annual exports.

EN_CC_100016.txt,Other,Other,"Heavy storms hit southern Europe causing huge disruption 

 Strong winds and heavy rains have hit Spain and Italy causing widespread flooding and devastation

Train services between France and Italy have been halted until Thursday at the earliest, after a huge rock slide in the Maurienne valley in the French Alps. It also blocked some roads, officials said on Monday.

Regional authorities in Savoie said the rockslide occurred at 5:15 pm (1515 GMT) on Sunday, when ""boulders with a total volume of 700 cubic metres (25,000 cubic feet)"" slammed into a protective barrier along the RD 1006 road that leads to the Mont-Cenis pass into Italy's Susa valley.

The landslide forced the suspension of all cross-border trains on the Chambery-Turin line, as well as TER regional trains in the Maurienne valley, French rail operator SNCF said.

The Frejus tunnel connecting France and Italy under the Alps has also been closed to heavy trucks, whose drivers are being advised to use the Mont Blanc tunnel or the A8 motorway instead.

French Transport Minister Clement Beaune said a return to normal services ""will require several days"".

""After this massive landslide yesterday in Maurienne, our services are mobilised to restore road and rail service as quickly as possible,"" he said on social media.

Spain's Mediterranean coastline was hit Sunday by violent winds and heavy rain, which caused several minor injuries and substantial material damage and disrupted several flights.

Gusts of up to 120 km/h, downpours and sometimes hail hit the Balearic Islands and the regions of Catalonia and Valencia, all three of which were partially placed under orange alert (high risk) on Sunday by the National Meteorological Agency (Aemet).

The weather is part of a violent storm that broke out on Sunday morning, blowing down numerous trees, causing flash flooding and damaging a bullring in the town of Felanitx.

The thunderstorms left motorists having to navigate treacherous conditions.

The wind also broke the moorings of a 330-metre tourist cruise ship moored in Palma, on the island of Mallorca, displacing it until it collided with a moored oil tanker.

The accident caused six minor injuries, the Port Authority of the Balearic Islands said in a statement.

At least 24 flights were cancelled and 29 were diverted to and from the Balearic Islands on Sunday, Spanish airport operator Aena announced.

Heavy rains led to an accumulation of more than 100 litres of water per square metre in some parts of Catalonia in the middle of a drought. In Vilassar de Mar, firefighters rescued a motorist whose vehicle was dragged by the water and became trapped under a bridge.

Powerful winds and torrential rain also poured in Northern Italy, first in Lombardy on Saturday, when heavy storms uprooted trees and damaged roofs and then on Sunday in Liguria.

People in Genoa on Sunday morning were caught off-guard by the heavy rainfall and a high alert remains in place for most of Monday in Liguria.

The Poppea cyclone, coming from the North of Europe, is pushing its way across the country and it is set to sweep away the summer heat wave.

Wildfires continue to rage in parts of Greece

Meanwhile, wildfires have continued to rage in parts of Greece. A fire that broke out on the Cycladic island of Andros on Saturday, probably caused by lightning, was brought under control by Sunday as firefighters remained in key hotspots as a precaution due to strong winds blowing in the area.

Firefighting efforts focused on the front near the village of Vitali. 73 firefighters with 18 fire trucks were operating at the scene, while two aircraft and two helicopters provided assistance from the air.

With hot, dry summers, southern European countries are particularly prone to wildfires however, European Union officials have blamed climate change for the increasing frequency and intensity of such fires, noting that 2022 was the second-worst year for wildfire damage on record after 2017.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],heavy storm hit southern europe cause huge disruption strong wind heavy rain hit spain italy cause widespread flooding devastation train service france italy halt thursday early huge rock slide maurienne valley french alp block road official say monday regional authority savoie say rockslide occur pm gmt sunday boulder total volume cubic metre cubic foot slam protective barrier rd road lead mont cenis pass italy susa valley landslide force suspension cross border train chambery turin line ter regional train maurienne valley french rail operator sncf say frejus tunnel connect france italy alp close heavy truck driver advise use mont blanc tunnel motorway instead french transport minister clement beaune say return normal service require day massive landslide yesterday maurienne service mobilise restore road rail service quickly possible say social medium spain mediterranean coastline hit sunday violent wind heavy rain cause minor injury substantial material damage disrupt flight gust km downpour hail hit balearic island region catalonia valencia partially place orange alert high risk sunday national meteorological agency aemet weather violent storm break sunday morning blow numerous tree cause flash flooding damage bullring town felanitx thunderstorm leave motorist have navigate treacherous condition wind break mooring -metre tourist cruise ship moor palma island mallorca displace collide moored oil tanker accident cause minor injury port authority balearic islands say statement flight cancel divert balearic island sunday spanish airport operator aena announce heavy rain lead accumulation litre water square metre part catalonia middle drought vilassar de mar firefighter rescue motorist vehicle drag water trap bridge powerful wind torrential rain pour northern italy lombardy saturday heavy storm uproot tree damaged roof sunday liguria people genoa sunday morning catch guard heavy rainfall high alert remain place monday liguria poppea cyclone come north europe push way country set sweep away summer heat wave wildfire continue rage part greece wildfire continue rage part greece fire break cycladic island andros saturday probably cause lightning bring control sunday firefighter remain key hotspot precaution strong wind blow area firefighting effort focus near village vitali firefighter fire truck operate scene aircraft helicopter provide assistance air hot dry summer southern european country particularly prone wildfire european union official blame climate change increase frequency intensity fire note second bad year wildfire damage record

 So, what’s this newfound hostility against the thing that keeps us alive?

Take a deep breath. Farming uses nitrogen, and suddenly, nitrogen is the new antagonist in the tale of global warming. The narrative is simple: eliminate nitrogen, and save the world. Yet, in the name of “preservation,” entire segments of our food production are under siege.

Consider rice – a staple for half the world’s population. Renowned agencies claim, “Rice accounts for roughly 10% of global methane emissions,” emphasising the urgent need to curtail its production. But the ramifications? Starvation for billions.

Look to the Netherlands for further evidence. Dutch farmers, the backbone of a nation that is a leading exporter of meat and agricultural products, are being chased off their lands. A staggering number, 3,000 farms, are forecasted to be confiscated in the coming years. The tragic fallout is evident, with a reported 20 to 30 farmers tragically ending their lives annually.

Our friends in Europe are no strangers to these baffling decisions either. The European Commission greenlit a strategy to compensate livestock farmers for halting their operations in certain areas – with a stipulation that they never resume their animal breeding activities. The implications are clear: a drop in global food availability and an inevitable spike in prices.

Remember Sri Lanka’s ill-fated venture into 100% organic farming? The island nation faced a humanitarian nightmare with a staggering 90% of its population on the brink of starvation.

 New Delhi: Ahead of the presidential election in Nigeria, there has been an explosion of fake news across social media platforms. Divisive content on subjects like religion and ethnicity is also littered across social media networks like Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and WhatsApp.

According to a report in Al Jazeera, “Social media allows Nigerians to share information in real-time, political strategists are weaponising this ahead of the forthcoming polls.”

A BBC report in January uncovered how Nigerian politicians secretly paid social media influencers as much as 20 million Nigerian naira ($43,000) or promised government contracts and political appointments to spread disinformation about opponents. Some of these influencers are also being recruited to “situation rooms” to monitor the spread of the fake news, the report added.

Meanwhile, Nigeria is grappling with widespread fuel shortages that are forcing motorists to spend hours in lines to buy gas and causing prices to surge for transportation and basic commodities.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has caused prices to import fuel go up by more than 100% but retailers complain they can only charge the price set by the government, causing them to operate at a loss.

The cost of transporting gasoline to the depots has gone up by 80% in the past few months.

Gasoline shortages are frequent in Nigeria even though the country is one of Africa’s biggest producers of crude oil.

However, the country must import most of its fuel because it has very few functioning refineries.

EN_UA_102963.txt,Other,Other,"Ukraine's President Zelenskyy to address Mexico's Congress to gain support in ongoing conflict with Russia, say sources 

 Mexico City: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will address Mexico’s Congress by video on Thursday in an effort to gain support for his nation’s ongoing conflict with Russia, according to two persons with knowledge of the situation.

The leftist president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has come under fire from certain Ukrainian sympathisers for his opposition to European arm supplies to Kyiv. The Mexican administration has stated its desire to maintain neutrality in the crisis.

Nevertheless, Mexico has cast a vote on a number of significant UN resolutions with the United States and other Western nations.

According to the sources, the address was scheduled to start Thursday at about noon.

Zelenskyy’s address to the lower house of Congress came at the invitation of a congressional friendship group between Mexico and Ukraine, according to the sources. There are other similar groups in the Mexican Congress, including one for Russia.

The Ukrainian embassy in Mexico did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The German president and the US ambassador to Mexico have been among the diplomatic allies that have sought to persuade the Mexican government to side with Ukraine against Russia.

Attempts to sway public opinion in Mexico over the war in Ukraine have led to some notable spats in Congress.

Last year, the Russian ambassador to Mexico told Mexican lawmakers that Mexico would never take orders from “Uncle Sam”, prompting the US ambassador to urge Mexico to support Ukraine.

Lopez Obrador last year proposed a plan to halt the fighting in Ukraine, although Ukrainian officials opposed it, arguing it would be advantageous to Russia.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard met separately with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to discuss the peace plan at the UN General Assembly in September. Nothing has come of the plan so far.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is currently on a Latin American tour, visiting Brazil, Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.

 The United States knew in advance about the attacks on the Nord Stream pipeline, the largest act of industrial terrorism in history, but did not step in to prevent them, according to an interview with Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski published today.

In September 2022, Sikorski, then a member of the European Parliament (MEP), insinuated that Washington was complicit in the attack on the Nord Stream gas pipeline.

Sikorski tweeted a photo from the scene of the crime and signed it “Thank you, USA.” The MEP also pointed out Joe Biden’s standing threat to demolish the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. However, his tweet was deleted just a few hours later.

Speaking with Polish news outlet Rzeczpospolita as the Polish foreign minister his week, Sikorski said “If we believe media, it [the attack] was carried out by someone who was interested in it. And the US had preliminary information about this and did not interfere with this move.”

However, Sikorski chose not name those responsible for the crime.

Almayadeen reports: US investigative journalist and Pulitzer award winner Seymour Hersh said on February 8 2023 that US Navy divers planted explosives to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022.

“Last June, the Navy divers, operating under the cover of a widely publicized mid-summer NATO exercise known as BALTOPS 22, planted the remotely triggered explosives that, three months later, destroyed three of the four Nord Stream pipelines, according to a source with direct knowledge of the operational planning,” Hersh wrote in his Substack newsletter.

The White House responded and dismissed the claims as “false and complete fiction.”

Flightradar24 data showed in late September 2022 that US military helicopters habitually and on numerous occasions circled for hours over the site of the Nord Stream pipeline incident near Bornholm Island.

A US Navy Sikorsky MH-60R Seahawk helicopter spent hours loitering over the location of the damaged natural gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea near Bornholm for several days in a row, September 1, 2, and 3, of 2022 in particular.

Sources familiar with the investigation into the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions have confirmed media reports that traces lead to Ukraine, Sputnik reported on August 25, 2023.

German media, ZDF and Der Spiegel said that there is no evidence of Russia’s involvement in the pipeline explosions.

 RUSSIA has snatched nearly 300 children from a Ukrainian city in the past month sending them to military camps to become ""Russian zombies.""

Ruthless child snatchers have abducted a total of 280 kids from the annexed Antratsytiv district in Luhansk, according to a report.

The children were then taken to the Cossack cadet corps in Russia's Kalmykia region.

According to figures from Ukraine's National Resistance Center, Moscow plans to kidnap a total of 500 Ukrainian children by the end of summer.

The report claims that the children are not only abducted but sent to be ""zombified with aggressive propaganda"" by Vladimir Putin's forces.

It is estimated Russia has kidnapped well over 20,000 Ukrainian children since the start of the war, and sent them to be brainwashed and tortured.

A Ukrainian teenager told earlier this month how he was kidnapped from school and shipped off to a hellhole Russian camp.

Vitaliy Vertash, 16, told how he was stuck in a room with four others - and they were only fed soup and buckwheat while facing beatings from the ""camp employees"".

The true horrors of the ""re-education camps"" echo that of Nazi Germany, and have turned countless innocent children into ""Russian Zombies"".

Last year, a Sun investigation revealed Vlad's crony Maria Lvova Belova had headed up an organisation tasked with putting kidnapped Ukrainian children into Russian homes.

Meanwhile, up to 5,000 adults were also kidnapped by Russian forces in besieged Mariupol and sent to work camps in Russia.

Some were forced to wear overlarge Russian military uniforms that could make them a target while others dug mass graves for their fallen comrades in the Russian-held region of Zaporizhzhia.

One man who refused to dig was shot on the spot.

Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are being detained across Russia in centres ranging from brand-new wings in Russian prisons to hellhole basements.

And it is likely Russia is planning to hold much more, in line with Putin's plan of erasing the Ukrainian culture.

And Russia is planning to hold possibly thousands more.

A Russian government document obtained by The Associated Press dating to January outlined plans to create 25 new prison colonies and six other detention centers in occupied Ukraine by 2026.

The Russian dictator signed a decree in May allowing Russia to send people from territories with martial law, which includes all of occupied Ukraine, to those without, such as Russia.

This makes it easier to deport Ukrainians who resist Russian occupation deep into Russia.

Many civilians are picked up for alleged transgressions as minor as speaking Ukrainian or simply being a young man in an occupied region, and are often held without charge.

 LAHORE - Bahria Town, under the visionary leadership of Malik Riaz Hussain, ismaking Pakistan proud by receiving global recognition for its impactful social welfare endeavors. Highlighted in a recent report by The World Financial Review. “Malik Riaz, Asia’s largest real estate developer, has set an example that might inspire other Pakistani entrepreneurs to step forward and address the needs of an increasingly low-income population” says the report.

Malik Riaz and Bahria Town’s commitment to addressing hunger and poverty in Pakistan through initiatives like Bahria Dastarkhwan has garnered significant praise. Some globally well-known newspapers i.e. News Week, CNN, Los Angeles Times, EuroAsia Industry and The National already have recognized Malik Riaz Hussain and Bahria Town’s social welfare initiatives. The article statEs that in a country where economic challenges persist and government resources are stretched thin, Bahria Town has stepped up to fill critical gaps in social welfare. From providing free meals to hundreds of thousands through Bahria Dastarkhwan to mobilizing rescue teams during natural disasters, Bahria Town’s efforts have touched the lives of millions.

Furthermore, the article reads as Malik Riaz’s belief in mutual prosperity drives such philanthropic initiatives, aimed at improving the lives of ordinary Pakistanis. While recognizing the limitations of private initiatives, Bahria Town remain hopeful for increased government support to amplify its impact further. Moreover, the report asserts that as climate change exacerbates challenges in Pakistan, Bahria Town remains steadfast in its commitment to serving communities in need. Bahria Town’s relief operations during the 2022 floods underscore its dedication to humanitarian causes. The global acknowledgment of Bahria Town and Malik Riaz’s efforts underscores the pivotal role of the private sector in addressing societal challenges.

EN_CC_100136.txt,Other,Other,"Climate Science Denial Group GWPF Admits It Used False Temperature Graph 

 The climate science denying group the Global Warming Policy Foundation has admitted that it shared an “erroneous” temperature dataset to support Lord Lawson’s false claims to the BBC last week that global temperatures aren’t rising.

Three days after Lawson’s BBC interview – which was immediately and widely criticised in the media and by scientists – the climate denial group tweeted out Sunday afternoon that it was “happy to correct the record” and has since removed the tweet after a request to do so by climate scientist Ed Hawkins.

According to the tweets, the graph was originally produced by US meteorologist Ryan Maue, an adjunct scholar of the libertarian think tank the Cato Institute co-founded by Charles Koch. It was published by weather forecaster and climate science denier Joe Bastardi. Both Bastardi and Maue work for WeatherBELL Analytics, a private weather consulting firm.

Screenshot of GWPF tweets taken on August 14 2017.

Thanks for acknowledging this Benny. Are you could to delete the original tweet so that this erroneous claim doesn’t spread further?

— Ed Hawkins (@ed_hawkins) August 13, 2017

Indeed. My bias, my mistake.

— GWPF (@thegwpfcom) August 13, 2017

As a number of climate scientists have been quick to point out, Lawson was wrong to claim that the average global temperature has “slightly declined” since 2007. In fact, the global surface temperature over this period has risen, with the three hottest years on record occurring in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

In addition to being a reaction to those debunking the graph’s false and misleading claims, the GWPF’s efforts to distance themselves from the inaccurate data comes one day after neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer featured a story using the same graph with the headline “It’s Colder Now Than When Al Gore Won the Nobel Prize for Kook Theory in 2007”.

Eric Kaufmann: Populists Are Losing This War

Eric Kaufmann thinks we are losing the war.

The latest CBS News poll shows strong support for imposing sanctions on Russia, implementing a No-Fly Zone and a willingness to pay higher gas prices to punish Russia. Vladimir Putin also polls poorly with Republican voters. The hawks clearly think that they are on the upswing in the GOP.

“Back in February, we had a pretty good idea what was going on. Video and satellite imagery had shown the steady increase and massing of Russian troops, tanks, and military supplies around Ukraine’s borders. Vladimir Putin had started wars before — and here he was again, on the precipice of something truly horrific.

What bothered me was the extent to which several high-profile populist conservatives were seeming to reflexively side with the cruel Russian autocrat. I watched as Tucker Carlson and J.D. Vance defended Putin, or adopted the Kremlin’s critique of Ukraine. The country was a “pure client state of the United States State Department” said Carlson. “Spare me the performative affection for the Ukraine” said Vance on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast.

These interventions, made as Russia began an invasion that looks set to result in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, look high risk and low reward. These commentators are undermining the credibility they have accrued for taking bold stances on the “security and identity” issues their base really cares about. Namely: wokeness, the border, crime and defending national heritage. …”

We’re going to dig in on this.

 Ukraine’s Western allies are concerned that the military support for Kyiv may soon peak, as the US enters a divisive presidential, the Financial Times reported on Thursday, citing unnamed Western officials.

“Ukraine’s allies fear military support for its battle against Russia is nearing a peak, with senior European officials increasingly concerned about the flow of aid next year as the US enters a divisive presidential campaign,” the Financial Times reported.

According to the FT, Washington has been Kyiv’s major source of military aid. US officials interviewed by the newspaper say the remaining funds preapproved by Congress could sustain Ukraine for about another five months. Western officials in regular contact with the US over Ukraine told the FT that Washington sees that period of time as the last real chance for Kyiv to change the situation on the ground.

“We can’t keep the same level of assistance forever,” a European official told the British newspaper as he argued that the current level of support could be sustained for another year or possibly two years but no more.

Politico reported earlier this week that only $6 billion of the original $48 billion military aid package that the US had approved previously now remains. According to the US publication, Washington’s funds for Kyiv may be fully allocated by mid-summer.

European allies are increasingly uncertain about whether the US will come close to matching its existing $48bn package, adopted in 2022, particularly as it requires a vote in Congress this autumn against the backdrop of more partisan debate on the war, FT reported.

Recently, European leaders promised Zelenskyy an arsenal of missiles, tanks and drones during a whirlwind three-day visit to Italy, the Vatican, Germany, France and the U.K. that sought to replenish Ukraine’s depleted weapons supplies ahead of a long-anticipated spring offensive aimed at turning the tide of the war.

Zelenskyy’s energetic international diplomacy over 15 months of war has persuaded Ukraine’s Western allies to send ever more powerful weapons, from German Leopard tanks to U.S. Patriot missile systems and Storm Shadow cruise missiles from the U.K.

The war in Ukraine that began a year ago has killed thousands, forced millions to flee their homes, reduced entire cities to rubble and has fuelled fears the confrontation could slide into an open conflict between Russia and NATO.

""Russia does not feel threatened"": Estonian Prime Minister calls for long-range missiles to be transferred to Ukraine

Western countries should provide the Armed Forces of Ukraine with all the weapons they need to liberate all the territories seized by Russia. First of all, Kyiv needs to be provided with long-range missiles.

This was the call to the West made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas in an interview with The Kyiv Independent published on Sunday, January 14. In her opinion, this is the only way to repel the aggressor country.

The head of the Estonian government reminded that Tallinn had officially decided to provide Kyiv with annual aid of 0.25% of its GDP over the next 4 years. She called on partners and allies to make the same decision.

Kallas said that the joint budgets of the countries that are members of the Ramstein format contact group on Ukraine's defense are ""much larger"" than Russia's budget.

""Every month, Moscow spends about 5.3 billion euros on the war. If we take the total budgets and this 0.25% of the GDP of all the states of the Ramstein coalition, it will be 120 billion. Such assistance would turn the tide in Ukraine's favor. The partners should provide Kyiv with all the military equipment they have,"" said the Estonian prime minister.

The absence of long-range weapons in the Ukrainian army gives the Russian occupation forces an advantage to seize more territories, Kallas noted.

""If they (Russians - Ed.) think they can win, then of course they don't feel threatened and just keep hitting Ukraine,"" the official said.

She also added that some Western countries are afraid that Moscow will lose and what consequences it will have. According to Kallas, the main task now is to end the war.

Speaking in the Estonian parliament on January 11, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine must win the battle against Russia because it is about the survival of the Ukrainian people.

 BRITISH troops will join Nato forces in Europe to help defend Ukraine if Russia dares to invade, Boris Johnson vowed last night.

The defiant PM warned that any incursion will spark the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War Two and “many Russian mothers’ sons will not be coming home”.

Mr Johnson said the UK and its allies would respond swiftly and “in unison” to any invasion and with severe economic sanctions.

He added: “The British Army leads the Nato battle group in Estonia and if Russia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments to protect our allies in Europe.”

They are unlikely to be combat troops but ministers refused to rule anything out.

Members of the Nato alliance — including Denmark, Spain, Bulgaria and the Netherlands — are sending more fighter jets and warships to Eastern Europe to bolster defences in the region.

The US has also put 8,500 troops on alert to deploy at short notice, which Russia said caused it “great concern”.

It came as ex-MI6 chief Sir Alex Younger warned he could not see a scenario where Russian President Vladimir Putin “can back down in a way that satisfies the expectations that he has created”.


But the former spy chief added that Mr Putin has rejected “the only reasonable compromise” of proposed arms controls and sees a free Ukraine as “an affront” to his dream of rebuilding Russia.

Mr Putin continues to deny he plans to invade Ukraine.

But he has a strike force assembled in the region, which includes 127,000 troops, war jets, battleships, missile batteries, artillery and drones.

His forces have also been conducting training drills on land, sea and air.

Meanwhile, Britain’s Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said “significant numbers” of Russian advance forces have already crossed the border as spies.

Missions include covert reconnaissance of key targets for destruction and intelligence gathering on which populations will support and which will resist an invasion.

Airspace above Ukraine is expected to shut down within days as tensions soar.

Last night, a Russian senator vowed to cut off Europe’s gas in response to Mr Johnson’s threat of “coordinated and severe economic sanctions heavier than anything we have done before against Russia”.

Vice Speaker Nikolay Zhuravlev said Moscow would also starve Europe of oil and metal exports if it was barred from using the Swift international payment system, in a move backed by the US and Britain but opposed by Germany.

And MPs warned that war could trigger hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing west into the EU.

Tory MP Karl McCartney told the Commons yesterday that an EU “distracted and full of infighting” and unable to respond may be “part of Putin’s thinking”.

He warned: “If this massive flow of refugees happens, it may well be the end of the EU.”",EN,"['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: The conflict will increase the Ukrainian refugee flows to Europe', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The EU is divided']",boris johnson vow send british troop defend ukraine russia dare invade british troop join nato force europe help defend ukraine russia dare invade boris johnson vow night defiant pm warn incursion spark bad bloodshed europe world war russian mother son come home mr johnson say uk ally respond swiftly unison invasion severe economic sanction add british army lead nato battle group estonia russia invade ukraine look contribute new nato deployment protect ally europe unlikely combat troop minister refuse rule member nato alliance include denmark spain bulgaria netherlands send fighter jet warship eastern europe bolster defence region troop alert deploy short notice russia say cause great concern come ex mi chief sir alex younger warn scenario russian president vladimir putin way satisfy expectation create spy chief add mr putin reject reasonable compromise propose arm control see free ukraine affront dream rebuild russia mr putin continue deny plan invade ukraine strike force assemble region include troop war jet battleship missile battery artillery drone force conduct training drill land sea air britain armed force minister james heappey say significant number russian advance force cross border spy mission include covert reconnaissance key target destruction intelligence gathering population support resist invasion airspace ukraine expect shut day tension soar night russian senator vow cut europe gas response mr johnson threat coordinated severe economic sanction heavy russia vice speaker nikolay zhuravlev say moscow starve europe oil metal export bar swift international payment system back britain oppose germany mp warn war trigger hundred thousand refugee flee west eu tory mp karl mccartney tell common yesterday eu distracted infighting unable respond putin thinking warn massive flow refugee happen end eu

 by Tom Luongo, Tom Luongo:

“The Vorlons say, understanding is a three-edged sword: your side, their side, and the truth”

— John Sheridan, Babylon 5

The biggest media story of 2024 so far has come and gone. Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin last week.

Everyone, even the Davos/UK dominated media, has put forth their opinion on it. I gave out a quick take for my Patrons the morning after just like everyone else. And like everyone else I missed the biggest takeaway from this interview.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Now, if you go through the commentary what you will mostly see is people, as always, doing what traders call “talking their book.” In other words, as opposed to dealing with the information presented and the motivations of the people involved, most media outlets and commentators put forth their opinion on whether this interview satisfied their needs from it.

So, for the hardcore geopolitical types and armchair psychoanalysts, we heard a lot of opinions second-guessing Putin’s strategy to open the interview with a nearly thirty minute recitation of Russian/Ukrainian history. Why would he do this, was the common refrain.

I’ll use my former-bellwether-for-normies, Scott Adams, as an example of this.

How many of you thought Putin was “all there” in the Tucker interview?

If he seemed lucid to you, it’s because Biden is your comparison.

I thought Putin seemed unhinged. The history lesson was not a good sign. https://t.co/VZiEIHRZ2t

— Scott Adams (@ScottAdamsSays) February 9, 2024

This was the kindest of the ‘bad takes’ I found on this. But I’m having one of Scott’s “One movie, two screens,” moments here. Because Putin looked anything other than “unhinged.” In fact, he looked as calm as I’ve ever seen him, taking a relaxed posture to put Carlson, who was clearly unsure of where he stood at the beginning of the interview, at ease.

But this is the message that Adams wanted to see, framing Putin in relation to Biden, because he needed something unique to say to justify his even being in the conversation.

By contrast, Martin Armstrong had a great post curating all of the crazy Neocon takes from the “media” on his blog over the weekend.

What’s obvious from those is that they understood that Putin’s 30 minute opening monologue would put off a lot of casual watchers who would tune him out at that point. So, their “analysis” focused on steering the conversation to Putin’s ‘false history’ of Russia and Ukraine.

This way that ‘false history’ would dominate everyone’s opinions the next day, managing the Overton Window of the entire interview, making it all about that. This would be the basis of how they discredit Putin.

Then to discredit Carlson, people like Hillary Clinton was trotted out to lie about Tucker Carlson, calling him a “useful idiot,” and “puppy dog” and a joke in Russian media, which is an outright lie. Hillary’s harpy laugh made an appearance alongside a sycophant interviewer as they joked about Carlson’s having been fired from every legitimate news agency.

We were treated to a common sight: Two Beltway insiders laughing inside their echo chamber and only our sick fascination with roadkill makes it even remotely interesting.

So, the whole exercise is reframed as Puppy Dog Tucker throwing softballs to Liar Putin to distract us away from the sum and substance of their talk.

The United Nations, Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, major corporations, banks, Hollywood, governments and the biggest indoctrination institutions in the world including public schools, colleges and universities are regurgitating what the pope is saying because the world wonders after the beast, the Vatican (Revelation 13:3).

 BRAZZAVILLE, Oct. 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President William Ruto said on Saturday that Kenya will lift visa requirements for all Africans by the end of 2023 with the aim of boosting trade with African countries.

""By the end of this year, no African will need a visa to enter Kenya. The time has come to understand the importance of doing trade between us,"" said Ruto, while speaking at the summit of the world's three major forest basins, namely the Amazon, Congo, and Borneo-Mekong Forest Basins, in Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of the Congo.

Ruto noted the low rate of intra-African trade and urged to reduce customs tariffs within the African continent to accelerate the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area.

""It is time we realize the importance of trading among ourselves and allowing goods, services, people and ideas to move freely across the continent,"" he said, adding that trade among East African Community countries had grown significantly due to the removal of visa requirements and tariffs.

Ruto said that acknowledging and providing incentives to countries in tropical forest basins for forest protection is a smart climate action.

The Amazon basin in South America, the Congo basin in Central Africa, and the Borneo-Mekong basin in Southeast Asia collectively constitute 80 percent of the world's rainforests and contain approximately two-thirds of its biodiversity.

 Facebook now warns users NOT to ‘call for Putin assassination’ after controversial rule change

FACEBOOK users are now banned from calling for violence against heads of state.

Meta – the parent company of Facebook and Instagram – on Sunday clarified its recent violent speech policy to specifically not include calls for the death of a head of state.

The new announcement by Meta is likely in response to the violent posts users have been sharing towards Russian President Vladimir Putin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state… So, in order to remove any ambiguity about our stance, we are further narrowing our guidance to make explicit that we are not allowing calls for the death of a head of state on our platforms,"" Meta global affairs President Nick Clegg said, per Reuters.

Meta's clarification came shortly after the company revealed last week that it would take a more relaxed stance on users calling for violence against Russian forces in the context of the Ukraine invasion.

""As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech,"" a Meta spokesperson said.

However, it appears that Meta's initial policy sparked confusion among both Facebook and Instagram users on what type of speech is exactly permitted.

Along with banning violent calls against state leaders, the American tech company also emphasized that their new policy does not allow for hate speech towards Russian civilians.

""We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,"" Clegg said.

""Meta stands against Russophobia. We have no tolerance for calls for genocide, ethnic cleansing, or any kind of discrimination, harassment, or violence towards Russians on our platform,"" Clegg added.

Last Friday, the Kremlin opened a court case against Meta in direct retaliation to the social media giant's violent speech policy.

""A criminal case has been initiated … in connection with illegal calls for murder and violence against citizens of the Russian Federation by employees of the American company Meta,"" Russia's Investigative Committee said, according to Reuters.

The Russian prosecutor general's office asked a court to designate Meta an ""extremist organization"" and ban it from operating in the country after the social media giant changed its hate speech rules on Friday, per the Wall Street Journal.

The prosecutor's office added that Meta's actions not only constitute terrorist activity but also incite ""hatred and enmity"" towards Russian citizens.

Several weeks ago, Russia also announced that it would block civilians' access to Facebook and since then the media platform has been heavily restricted.

EN_UA_300044.txt,Other,Other,"Fed Drives a Stake Into Own Rate-Setting 'Newthink' 

 Rest in peace, flexible average inflation targeting. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points on Wednesday, spurred into the biggest single move since 1994 by surging prices.

That may not kill inflation – but it does effectively kill Chair Jay Powell’s 2-year-old push to emphasize inclusive employment.

In the end, rising prices forced Powell’s hand. In May, the Fed chief had said he favored steady 0.5 percentage-point rate increases to contain inflation. But then Labor Department data showed consumer prices rising 8.6% year-over-year, the fastest pace since 1981. And Americans’ median expectations for inflation in May 2023 increased, according to a New York Fed survey released on Monday.

That has made the Fed’s newish framework, flexible average inflation targeting, acronym FAIT, untenable. Back in 2020, Powell said that after years of inflation below the central bank’s 2% target, it would shift to a new, flexible approach.

Rates would be allowed to stay near zero, even if inflation went above 2% for a while, to make sure the economy was creating enough jobs for groups like Black workers, who are often the last to benefit from economic expansions and who weren’t considered separately in the old ways of rate-setting.

Aggressively raising rates now risks leaving those workers in the lurch. The unemployment rate for Black Americans in May was 6.2% compared to the overall 3.6% level and 3.2% for white employees.

And now the Fed projects the jobless pace will tick up the next few years. Elsewhere, expectations for debt delinquencies went up from April to May for those with an education level of a high school degree or less, according to the New York Fed survey. It will be for politicians, not central bankers, to decide how best to help those left behind.

There may still be room for Powell to innovate – for example, revisiting the 2% inflation target. The Fed failed to hit that on the way up for years, but the pandemic, trade wars and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have permanently altered supply chains and spending patterns.

The central bank’s June median projection for inflation this year is higher than in March at 5.2%.

Even so, all newthink is best left until prices have found their level.

EN_UA_300103.txt,"URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy","URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests","Vantage | Every day of war and their stock goes up, pockets bulge 

 We talked about the players, we talked about the stakeholders, we talked about the politics. Now, let’s talk about the benefits. We know it sounds like a paradox. This is, after all, a war so who can possibly benefit? The defence industry.

Wars can lead to an increase in defence spending. The more prolonged and intense the conflict, the greater the demand. A government that is fighting a war will obviously spend more money. So, nations invest heavily in technology, in weaponry, and in infrastructure.

This heightened demand helps defence companies across the globe, and that causes stocks to rally. Take U.S. defence stocks for example. They have added $23 billion in market value since the war began. On Monday, Northrop Grumman soared by 12%, General Dynamics jumped 9%, Lockheed Martin gained 8% and RTX rallied 4%, and this is only expected to grow in the days ahead.

Take Lockheed Martin, for example. This company makes the F-35 fighter jets being used by the Israel military. They also make Black Hawk helicopters. Northrop Grumman makes combat vehicles. Israel uses all these weapons and will need more in the future. The U.S. will be sending more weapons to Israel in the coming days, so the stocks of these companies are expected to rally.

And this won’t be the first time this happens. Last year too, defence stocks got a huge boost when Russia invaded Ukraine. As of today, the US has spent over $40 billion in military aid to Ukraine, so the biggest beneficiary is the American defence sector and that is likely to be the case with this war too.

This is one of the harshest realities of war. For some people, wars cost lives and for others, they drive value. For defence companies wars act as economic stimulus, they bolster sales, they fuel job creation and sometimes they also boost local economies.

Now, of course, this does raise moral and ethical questions like: is this profiting from human suffering? More importantly: is this motivation to prolong a conflict? Plus, there is the investor dilemma: defence stocks are often called sin stocks, or warmonger investments.

But the label here doesn’t matter, these stocks surge massively during war and that makes them very attractive for investors. Currently, the world is dealing with two wars - the Ukraine war, and now, the Israel-Hamas war. Defence spending was already on the rise this year. Europe has ramped up military sending, the highest since the cold war. Asian nations have also bumped spending. Defence budgets of Japan and South Korea grew by 7% in 2022, India’s defence budget was $81.4 billion in 2022, a rise of 6% from 2021.

Currently, global military spending is at $2.24 trillion, which is 2.2% of the world’s GDP. Chances are it will only rise further in the coming days.

EN_UA_300141.txt,Other,Other,"Russia's war in Ukraine 'greatest challenge' to global economy: Yellen 

 Russia's war in Ukraine poses the greatest threat to the global economy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, as Group of 20 ministers prepare to start talks in Bali.

Russia's war in Ukraine poses the greatest threat to the global economy, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday, as Group of 20 ministers prepare to start talks in Bali.

Moscow's invasion has sent inflation soaring at a time when the world is struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, endangering the gains of the past two years and threatening widespread hunger and poverty.

""Our greatest challenge today comes from Russia's illegal and unprovoked war against Ukraine,"" she said ahead of a finance ministers and central bank governors’ meeting on Friday and Saturday.

""We are seeing negative spillover effects from that war in every corner of the world, particularly with respect to higher energy prices and rising food insecurity,"" she added.

""The international community must be clear-eyed about holding Putin accountable for the global economic and humanitarian consequences of his war.""

Yellen said she would continue to press G20 allies at the meeting for a price cap on Russian oil to choke off Putin's war chest and pressure Moscow to end its invasion while bringing down energy costs.

""A price cap [...] is one of our most powerful tools,"" she said, adding that a limit would deny Putin ""the revenue his war machine needs"".

She expressed hope that India and China would join such a cap, saying it ""would serve their own interests"" to put downward pressure on prices for consumers across the world.

But she refused to be drawn on whether Western officials would stage a multi-nation walkout when Russian officials speak, as they did at a G20 meeting in Washington in April.

""It cannot be business as usual,"" she said. ""I can tell you that I can certainly expect to express in the strongest possible terms my views on Russia's invasion [...] to talk about its impact on Ukraine and the entire global economy and to condemn it.""

""I expect that many of my colleagues will do the same.""

Global outlook 'darkened'

Russia's finance minister will not attend the Bali talks, instead addressing them virtually, a week after Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov found himself outnumbered by G20 counterparts in their criticism of Moscow's military assault.

Yellen's comments echo those of the head of the International Monetary Fund, who said on Wednesday that the global economic outlook had ""darkened significantly"" because of Moscow's invasion, just months after it revised down its global growth forecast for 2022 and 2023.

The IMF is ""projecting a further downgrade to global growth"" in 2022 and 2023, Kristalina Georgieva said in a blog post published ahead of this weekend's meeting.

The risk of ""social instability"" was also increasing because of rising food and energy prices, she wrote.

But there was substantive progress made in attempts to break the impasse on Wednesday after Russia and Ukraine met in Turkey for their first direct talks since March on a deal to relieve the food crisis caused by blocked Black Sea grain exports.

UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called it a ""ray of hope to ease human suffering and alleviate hunger around the world"" ahead of another planned round of talks next week.

 Putin Deploys Troops Along Finland Border In Response To NATO Accession

Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in fresh remarks that Finland and Sweden’s entry into NATO are ""a meaningless step"" but that in response Moscow will still deploy troops and ""systems of destruction"" to the Finnish border after Finland joined the alliance.

""Frankly speaking, I don’t understand why they need this. This is an absolutely meaningless step from the point of view of ensuring their own national interests,"" Putin said.

""We generally had ideal relations with Finland, simply ideal. We did not have a single claim against each other, especially territorial ones,"" Putin continued, before saying that Finland's NATO accession was really born out of a desire to ""join the Western club"".

""We didn't even have troops; we removed all the troops from there, from the Russian-Finnish border,"" he said. ""However, it is up to them to decide. That's what they decided. But we didn't have troops there, now we will.""

Finland became the 31st member of the alliance last April, but it was on Monday that Sweden formally became the 32nd at a flag raising ceremony at NATO headquarters in Brussels.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said expressly at the ceremony that his country abandoned historic neutrality as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""The Russian, brutal, full-scale invasion against Ukraine united Sweden behind the conclusion that a full-fledged NATO membership is the only reasonable choice,"" Kristersson said.

On Wednesday soaring tensions between Russia and Nordic countries were on display during new remarks of Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.

He claimed in a speech before European Parliament that Moscow is preparing for a ""long conflict with the West"" and ""represents a permanent and essential military threat to Europe.""

""If we, as a united Europe, fail to respond sufficiently to this challenge, the coming years will be filled with danger and the looming threat of attack,"" he said, before adding: ""Russia is not invincible.""

Denmark too is among those calling for increased defense spending and greater coordination on European defense.

The Biden-Schumer Plan To Kill More Ukrainians

President Joe Biden is refusing to fold a losing hand as he bets with Ukrainian lives and U.S. taxpayer money. Biden and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer propose to squander the lives of tens of thousands more Ukrainians and $61 billions of federal funds to keep Biden's disastrous foreign policy failure hidden from view until after the November election.

The $61 billion will make no difference on the battlefield except to prolong the war, the tens of thousands of deaths, and the physical destruction of Ukraine. It will not ""save"" Ukraine. Ukraine's security can only be achieved at the negotiating table, not by some fantasized military triumph over Russia.

$61 billion is not nothing. This worse-than-useless outlay would exceed the combined budgets of the U.S. Department of Labor, Environmental Protection Agency, National Science Foundation, and the Women, Infant, and Children nutrition program.

Almost exactly 10 years ago this month, Biden did much to put Ukraine on the path to disaster. This is well known to those who have looked carefully at the facts but is kept hidden from view by the White House, the Senate Democrats, and the mainstream media that back Biden. I have previously provided a detailed chronology, with hyperlinks, here.

In 1990, President George H. W. Bush, Sr. and his German counterpart Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand eastward if the Soviet Union accepted German reunification.

EN_CC_200025.txt,Other,Other,"'Woke' Scientists Want Fast Food Menus to State Environmental Impact 

 Some scientists are pushing for warnings on foods such as fast food burgers to display they are bad for your health, joined with their impact on the planet.

A group of American researchers tested the climate-change warnings on fast food menus and found they encourage people to make more sustainable dietary decisions.

The labels were colored-coded. A red environmental impact stamp placed on beef led to a quarter more people abstaining, compared to those who did not see the warning.

Environmental guilt was more effective than the green ""good for the planet"" label, which encouraged only a tenth more people to choose more sustainable food.

British consumers already are used to the ""traffic-light"" good labels for those with more than the recommended fat, sugar, or salt.

A new group of American researchers is testing adding a similar system to combat climate change, among other things.

Their study, published in JAMA Network Open, claims it could have merit because animal-based food production, primarily through beef, accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

They tested it by enrolling over 5,000 participants putting them in three groups, and showing them a fast-food menu.

They had to select one item from the hypothetical 14 that had affixed labels from a red food lkabel stating, ""This item is not environmentally sustainable. It has high greenhouse gas emissions and a high contribution to climate change,"" to green one which read, ""This item is environmentally sustainable. It has low greenhouse gas emissions and a low contribution to climate change.""

The study found red labels to be the most effective at 23.5% more than the comparative choosing nonbeef in the control group.

Only 10% of people chose green, compared to the control group.

The lead author of the study, professor Julia Wolfson, an expert in food policy at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the results showed an effectiveness with the red-style labeling.

""We found that labeling red meat items with negatively framed, red high–climate impact labels was more effective at increasing sustainable selections than labeling non-red meat items with positively framed, green low–climate impact labels,"" she said.

Wolfson added those who were likely to choose green labels tended to eat healthier than the control. This is despite no fast food included on the menu.

She said regardless of its effectiveness, governments would need to enforce it by law.

""It is unlikely that industry would voluntarily adopt a negatively framed label approach; such an approach may need to be mandated or incentivized via legislation or regulation,"" Wolfson said.

EN_CC_100008.txt,Other,Other,"UK-based climate activists deflate tyres of SUVs in 18 countries. This is why they did it. 

 A group of UK-based climate activists, called the Tyre Extinguishers, is moving around deflating the tyres of parked SUVs (sports utility vehicles) on roads in an effort to combat global warming.

The group has claimed credit for tyre-deflating operations in American cities including New York City, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, and cities in England, Canada, France, Spain, Germany and Italy among others, according to a report by Fox News.

“Reports coming in of very angry #CarShaggers who are upset they can’t drive their massive tanks around Lisbon. Oh no! Welcome to the fun, Portugal! We will make SUVs history,” the group posted on Twitter along with an image of a Portuguese-language pamphlet the activists left on one of the targeted SUVs.

On their own website, the “Tyre Extinguishers” who believe in guerilla climate activism explain why they are protesting against SUVs. The group’s website has details and instructions on how to quickly deflate tires on parked cars. It also has a template for pamphlets that activists can use during their operations. Once the person deflates the tyres, they leave a document with a headline stating, “ATTENTION - your gas guzzler kills,” on the vehicle’s windshield explaining to its owner why such action was taken.

“You’ll be angry, but don’t take it personally. It’s not you, it’s your car. We did this because driving around in urban areas in your massive vehicle has huge consequences for others,” the pamphlet reads.

“We are people from all walks of life with one aim: To make it impossible to own a huge polluting 4x4 in the world’s urban areas,” the group’s website adds.

“We are defending ourselves against climate change, air pollution and unsafe drivers. We do this with a simple tactic: Deflating the tyres of these massive, unnecessary vehicles, causing inconvenience for their owners,” the website points out.

Tyre Extinguishers is a “leaderless, autonomous movement of groups that act independently,” according to their website.

“SUVs and 4x4s are a disaster for our health, our public safety, and our climate. Bigger and bigger cars are dominating our towns and cities, all so a privileged few can flaunt their wealth. Because governments and politicians have failed to protect us from this danger, we must protect ourselves. We want to make it impossible to own a huge polluting 4x4 in the world’s urban areas. We do this by deflating the tyres of these massive, unnecessary vehicles, causing inconvenience and expense for their owners,” says the website of the organisation.

 The truth that IPCC and NOAA do not want people to know includes the fact that CO2 breaks down into three different molecules when combined with water. These molecules are collectively known as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and one of them includes bicarbonate ions that comprise more than 90 percent of the ocean's current.

Carbonate ions comprise about nine percent of DIC, leaving invading CO2 levels at no more than one percent, which is inconsequential. This means that IPCC and NOAA are lying about CO2 acidifying the world's oceans when ocean waters actually contain less than one percent CO2.

It must also be noted that the other 99-plus percent of bicarbonate and carbonate ions that CO2 turns into when mixing with ocean water actually creates a buffer that prevents ocean water from acidifying. This creates what is essentially distilled water throughout ocean currents.

(Related: In 2021, a handful of scientist whistleblowers exposed ocean acidification as just another climate hoax designed to fool the masses into supporting more green tyranny.)

One of the other myths being spread by IPCC and NOAA involves the false claim that acidified ocean water, supposedly caused by too much CO2, is causing the shells of ocean creatures to dissolve. This simply cannot be true for the simple fact that ocean creatures with shells have protective coatings that prevent dissolution.

The same is true for coral polyps, which have special protection that guards their reef skeletons against being eroded through acidification. And ocean water is actually more protective than distilled water at keeping these shells intact to begin with, which makes climate claims to the contrary simply ridiculous.

""Shells and reefs are made of calcium carbonate,"" writes Jim Steele. ""The hoax abuses one true scientific factoid: At a lower pH, the added H+ ions will re-join with the ocean's buffering carbonate ions.""

""That reduces sea water's available carbonate ions by converting them to bicarbonate ion. So, alarmists' falsely claim acidification will reduce seawater's carbonate ions, making it more difficult to make calcium carbonate shells or reefs.""

Part of the climate hoax suggests that ocean shells and reefs import carbonate ions directly from seawater, but that too much CO2 inhibits this. All available evidence shows that shells and reefs only import CO2 and abundant bicarbonate ions, which are then converted internally to a carbonate ion.

In other words, CO2 from the atmosphere mixes with ocean water and turns into the exact ingredients that shells and reefs need to build strength and resiliency. CO2 actually helps them, not hurts them like the climate cult falsely claims.

The newly converted carbonate ions that result internally from CO2 mixing into water combines with calcium to form the calcium carbonate building blocks needed for reef skeletons and shells.

""Thus, any acidification that converts sea water carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions is actually helping reefs and shell-making which only absorb the critical CO2 and bicarbonate ions,"" Steele further explains.

""Knowing the real science, I can no longer trust the IPCC or NOAA's acidification alarmism misinformation.""

Further debunking the ocean acidification myth is the fact that the CO extracted from water, both salt and fresh, by coral, mollusks and other sea life ends up becoming chalk, limestone and marble.

""Amazingly, despite what we are told, the oceans are not boiling and one can still pick up seashells at the seashore,"" one commenter wrote, adding to this sentiment.

 Tory MP urges Keir Starmer to confirm if his plans for a new wave of wind farms are unconnected to the million pound Labour party donations made by eco-tycoon Dale Vince

- Ecotricity founder has said new wind parks 'make good economic sense'

Sir Keir Starmer should make clear that his plans for a new wave of wind farms are unconnected to the millions of pounds donated to Labour by an eco-tycoon, a Tory MP said last night.

One of Starmer's first acts after becoming Prime Minister was to lift the effective ban on onshore wind generation – in place since 2015 – giving the green light to a new wave of wind farms across the country.

The move comes in the wake of donations totalling £4.2 million from Ecotricity, a green energy supplier founded by millionaire Dale Vince – £2.7 million was accepted by the Labour Party in the first four months of 2024 alone.

Both Labour and Ecotricity strongly deny any connection between the donations and the policy change, but Ruislip MP David Simmonds said last night that it 'raised some serious questions'.

He said: 'In the spirit of transparency, we can only hope Keir Starmer answers these questions swiftly and in full.'

Sir Keir Starmer has been urged to confirm plans for new wind farms are not connected to Labour party donations by Ecotricity founder Dale Vince

Vince said in 2017 that a government decision to prevent new wind farms 'makes no sense and is a political choice'

Ecotricity, which currently has 74 turbines across 23 wind parks and recorded pre-tax profits of £44.7million in 2023, had 16 planning applications for wind farms refused before Labour won the election.

Campaigners are furious after plans to build one of Europe's largest solar farms were signed off by the Government.

Opposition to the 2,500-acre development in Cambridgeshire (the size of 1,500 football pitches), fuelled by concerns over farming, biodiversity and tourism, was overridden when Energy Secretary Ed Miliband gave the green light to energy company Sunnica's £600 million project.

Charlotte Cane, the local Liberal Democrat MP, described his decision as 'shocking'.

A second 2,000-acre project has been approved in Lincolnshire.

The company's most recent accounts stated: 'The group continues to lobby the UK government to pursue wider-reaching and more determined policies to address the climate emergency.'

In 2017, Vince said: 'Current government policy, to prevent new wind parks in England, makes no sense and is a political choice – because onshore energy isn't just good for the environment, it makes good economic sense too.'

The Daily Mail reported last week that thousands of onshore wind turbines could go up across the country under Labour.

In a statement, Vince said: 'The nonsensical ban on onshore wind added £15 billion to our energy bills since it was imposed – it made the energy crisis worse and lifting it is good for the whole country. I've donated money to Labour for many years, to help them compete and hopefully win the election. I believe they will make Britain a better country.

A Labour source said: 'The onshore wind ban put up energy bills for families and made Britain more energy insecure.

'By lifting the ban, this Labour Government is cutting bills for families and boosting Britain's energy independence.'",EN,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",tory mp urge keir starmer confirm plan new wave wind farm unconnected million pound labour party donation eco tycoon dale vince tory mp urge keir starmer confirm plan new wave wind farm unconnected million pound labour party donation eco tycoon dale vince ecotricity founder say new wind park good economic sense sir keir starmer clear plan new wave wind farm unconnected million pound donate labour eco tycoon tory mp say night starmer act prime minister lift effective ban onshore wind generation place give green light new wave wind farm country come wake donation total million ecotricity green energy supplier found millionaire dale vince million accept labour party month labour ecotricity strongly deny connection donation policy change ruislip mp david simmonds say night raise question say spirit transparency hope keir starmer answer question swiftly sir keir starmer urge confirm plan new wind farm connect labour party donation ecotricity founder dale vince vince say government decision prevent new wind farm make sense political choice ecotricity currently turbine wind park record pre tax profit .million planning application wind farm refuse labour win election campaigner furious plan build europe large solar farm sign government opposition -acre development cambridgeshire size football pitch fuel concern farming biodiversity tourism overridden energy secretary ed miliband give green light energy company sunnica million project charlotte cane local liberal democrat mp describe decision shock second -acre project approve lincolnshire company recent account state group continue lobby uk government pursue wider reach determined policy address climate emergency vince say current government policy prevent new wind park england make sense political choice onshore energy good environment make good economic sense daily mail report week thousand onshore wind turbine country labour statement vince say nonsensical ban onshore wind add billion energy bill impose energy crisis bad lift good country donate money labour year help compete hopefully win election believe britain well country labour source say onshore wind ban energy bill family britain energy insecure lift ban labour government cut bill family boost britain energy independence
EN_UA_300117.txt,Other,Other,"Report: Russia Ramps Up Use of Chem Weapons in Ukraine 

 U.S. and Ukrainian officials, as well as medics, soldiers, and international researchers, claim Russia is increasing its use of toxic gases on the battlefield is increasing as it escalates an offensive designed to seize more of Ukraine's territory than the roughly 20% it already occupies.

Last month, Ukrainian soldiers were encamped in a front-line dugout and under siege from Russian drones dropping grenades, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. Although there were no explosions when the first bombs landed, a strong smell of chlorine filled the air. The soldiers felt their skin sting, eyes water, and lungs fill with smoke, provoking a hard cough.

They placed rags soaked with water over their faces as the heavy gas filled the air. Oleksiy Bozhko, a volunteer medic whose team examined the men near the eastern city of Avdiivka, identified the gas as chloropicrin, a banned chemical irritant, based on the men's symptoms and descriptions of the smell, the Journal reported.

""This weapon cripples and kills, it's indiscriminate,"" Bozhko said.

The U.S. announced sanctions earlier this month against Russian companies and government bodies involved in the creation and supply of chemical weapons used at the front lines in Ukraine, singling out chloropicrin. The chemical agent, sometimes used in pesticides, was weaponized during World War I and is banned for use in battle by the Chemical Weapons Convention, of which Russia is a signatory.

After the U.S. sanctions announcement, the Journal reported, Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, called accusations that troops used toxic gases ""baseless,"" saying, ""Russia has been and remains committed to its obligations under international law in this area."" The Kremlin and the Russian Defense Ministry didn't immediately respond to requests from the Journal for comment.

Dan Kaszeta, an expert on chemical weapons and associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank, told the Journal chloropicrin is toxic to humans and animals, but also acts as an irritant.

Depending on the level of exposure, the gas can burn skin, irritate tear ducts, and make it difficult to breathe, let alone defend against incoming attacks. Kaszeta told the Journal the chemical has been surpassed by more modern agents sometimes used by riot police as tear gas, known as CN and CS, which are also banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Capt. Dmytro Serhiyenko, assistant to the commander of the Analytical Center of the Ukrainian Army's Support Forces, which analyzes chemical weapon use on the front lines, told the Journal all three of those agents are used by Russia on the battlefield. Although his team has mostly logged uses of CN and CS in the areas they track, they also found two grenades containing chloropicrin at abandoned Russian positions.

Ukrainians have been tracking the use of chemical weapons at the front since February 2023, the Journal reported, and the number of confirmed incidents has steadily increased. As of May 3, the Support Forces have confirmed 1,891 such attacks since they began tracking data, including 444 in April, an increase of 71 confirmed incidents from March. These numbers are incomplete because it isn't possible to get to the location where a gas was used to collect a sample or interview soldiers because of the intensity of the fighting.

The Truth About the JFK Assassination, the 9/11 Attacks, and the Holocaust

Back in 1959 Vice President Richard Nixon visited Moscow and held his famous “Kitchen debate” with Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev. Nixon favorably compared the standard of living of American suburbanites to that of their Russian counterparts under Communism.

Criticizing Soviet society was a serious crime in those days, but I doubt that the Russians ever considered arresting Nixon and giving him a ten year stretch in the gulag for “anti-Soviet agitation.” Not even Maoist China at the height of its Cultural Revolution would have considered such a thing.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

But late last week, on the eve of a Russia-China leadership summit in Moscow, Europe’s International Criminal Court (ICC) in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, the man who controls the world’s largest nuclear arsenal, whose striking power is further enhanced by its revolutionary hypersonic delivery systems.

The charges against Putin were that he had ordered the humanitarian evacuation of children from the dangerous Ukraine warzone, and the ICC also ordered the arrest of Maria Lvova-Belova, the Russian Commissioner for Children’s Rights.

Yet oddly enough, no ICC action had ever been taken against American Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who had famously declared in 1996 that the deaths of 500,000 Iraqi children brought about by the American economic sanctions she supported was “worth it.”

Indeed, in 2016 National Security Advisor John Bolton leveled harsh threats against ICC judges if they dared take legal action against any Americans accused of torture and murder, and many have noticed the strange lack of ICC even-handedness over the years.

But issuing a press release or even an arrest warrant does not necessarily determine events in real life, and the Moscow summit between Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping has hardly been disturbed. Taken together, Russia and China control a substantial fraction of the world’s natural resources and industrial capacity, and although their global propaganda presence is weak, those former factors are more important as elements of real world power.

As an example of this, last week Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most important Middle Eastern countries, announced in Beijing that after negotiations held under Chinese auspices they had reestablished diplomatic relations despite many years of bitter hostility:

- Russia, China, Iran…and Saudi Arabia?

Russia and Saudi Arabia are two of the world’s leading oil exporters, and with the latter nation now having dramatically shifted towards the Russia-China alliance, its leadership recently declared that they would ban sales to any country that sought to impose a price cap on its oil.",EN,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people']",fill blank spot national history ron unz unz review truth jfk assassination attack holocaust vice president richard nixon visit moscow hold famous kitchen debate soviet leader nikita khruschev nixon favorably compare standard living american suburbanite russian counterpart communism criticize soviet society crime day doubt russians consider arrest nixon give year stretch gulag anti soviet agitation maoist china height cultural revolution consider thing truth live https://sgtreport.tv/ late week eve russia china leadership summit moscow europe international criminal court icc hague issue arrest warrant russian president vladimir putin man control world large nuclear arsenal strike power enhance revolutionary hypersonic delivery system charge putin order humanitarian evacuation child dangerous ukraine warzone icc order arrest maria lvova belova russian commissioner child right oddly icc action take american secretary state madeleine albright famously declare death iraqi child bring american economic sanction support worth national security advisor john bolton level harsh threat icc judge dare legal action americans accuse torture murder notice strange lack icc handedness year international criminal court don recognize issue arrest warrant putin evacuate child warzone getting shell weapon one kill million people victim nation ww pic.twitter.com/effvvchbn kim dotcom @kimdotcom march issue press release arrest warrant necessarily determine event real life moscow summit putin chinese leader xi jinping hardly disturb take russia china control substantial fraction world natural resource industrial capacity global propaganda presence weak factor important element real world power example week saudi arabia iran important middle eastern country announce beijing negotiation hold chinese auspex reestablish diplomatic relation despite year bitter hostility russia china iran saudi arabia ron unz unz review march word month america western ally declare unilateral right set cap price russia charge oil seek use dominance international financial infrastructure reduce russian revenue sale natural resource country russia saudi arabia world lead oil exporter nation having dramatically shift russia china alliance leadership recently declare ban sale country seek impose price cap oil

 Safeguarding the interests of the wheat growers, PM Shehbaz Sharif’s decision to increase the wheat procurement target demonstrates a positive shift in government policy and reactiveness.

In a powerful example of peaceful and legitimate protest, the farmers’ protest was successful in influencing the policies of the state. The complaints of delays in wheat procurement and the exploitation by flour mills that were offering rates lower than the government-mandated price have been heard and addressed by the state.

The government’s decision not only addresses the grievances of the farmers but also reflects its willingness to listen to the concerns of the citizens and adjust government strategies in a timely manner – something we have been governmentally lacking for quite some time now.

The PM directed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation Limited to ensure the swift buying of wheat from these farmers. This is the epitome of how citizens can hold the government accountable, reforming the governance policies and driving a positive change in society.

However, the issue of wheat prices is still an issue – one that may not exactly be in the hands of the state. Support prices set by the provincial governments vary, as can be seen in the case of Balochistan and Sindh. Their respective prices are not adjusted to the recent inflation and have been carried on from last year’s wheat prices.

This is further aggravating the concerns of the farmers who are facing a higher cost of production owing to the higher energy and fertilizer costs. Not only does this make it challenging for the farmers to receive fair compensation for their produce, but it also does not take into account the impact of global warming that has further worsened their troubles. Heavier showers this year have adversely affected the harvesting season and crop yields for these farmers, and this needs to be accounted for.

The government’s efforts to address their concerns are a good step, but we need to extend more support to them in these difficult times. If we want to be more proactive in our governance, then considering the long-term implications of climate change on our agriculture will be wise moving forward.

Unpredictable weather patterns and extreme precipitation disproportionately affect our farmers, jeopardizing their sole source of income. As such, the state must stand by vulnerable farming communities and formulate policies to mitigate the impact, ensuring sustainable agricultural development in the nation.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],protest drive change safeguard interest wheat grower pm shehbaz sharif decision increase wheat procurement target demonstrate positive shift government policy reactiveness powerful example peaceful legitimate protest farmer protest successful influence policy state complaint delay wheat procurement exploitation flour mill offer rate low government mandate price hear address state government decision address grievance farmer reflect willingness listen concern citizen adjust government strategy timely manner governmentally lacking time pm direct pakistan agricultural storage service corporation limit ensure swift buying wheat farmer epitome citizen hold government accountable reform governance policy drive positive change society issue wheat price issue exactly hand state support price set provincial government vary see case balochistan sindh respective price adjust recent inflation carry year wheat price aggravate concern farmer face high cost production owe high energy fertilizer cost challenge farmer receive fair compensation produce account impact global warming worsen trouble heavy shower year adversely affect harvesting season crop yield farmer need account government effort address concern good step need extend support difficult time want proactive governance consider long term implication climate change agriculture wise move forward unpredictable weather pattern extreme precipitation disproportionately affect farmer jeopardize sole source income state stand vulnerable farming community formulate policy mitigate impact ensure sustainable agricultural development nation

Shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev, Al Gore and Carl Sagan were working together to push the global warming scam.

h/t Thomas Heller @Thos_Heller

Life was far simpler in the 1980s & ‘90s, people simply wanted to save ‘the environment’. Now they want to save THE WHOLE PLANET fergoodness sake. The curse of the cult of D.O.G. – Delusions Of Grandeur.

“to redefine the relationship between the individual citizen and the state”

“molding humankind’s self conciousness”

sums it pretty much up.

Though it is more humankind’s subconciousness that has been systematically molded with racism,trans,all kind of phobias,climate,viruses,vaccines.

Seems they unleashed a similar number of attacks on mankind

as mankind has unleashed on nature.

(So much that we went from only Gorbatchew sharing Sagans climate anxiety

to 100s of millions of people having been tricked into this anxiety by now)

And this may even be the main reason why the warming nonsense exists –

the equivalent of the needed “Alien attack” to unite(Ronnie must have loved those watchman comics),

which turned these 3 alien

to climate into climate experts.

Especially Sagans take is interessting.

As he and his compatriots used at the same time 10.000s of times higher co2 concentrations(I don’t even dare to imagine this runaway effect and why this effect has been running in the wrong in the wrong direction since then) trying to explain the faint young sun paradox.

I wonder what happened in the meantime that turned a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of co2 into such a behemoth?

And as this text is from before the end of the soviet union one wonders

where and how did Sagan observe all those climate changes that caused him anxietys?

By looking at the stars and all the Ice Age Propaganda of the 70ies?

There was no sea level rise.

Arctic data only existed since 1979

and his buddy Paul Ehrlich he wrote a book with,was an Ice Age Zealot

who already announced the world to end in a blue cloud and mass starvation any time soon.

It is also interessting that once again,out of all countries, the USA is once again is the major player here

and that after the end of the USSR this all somehow resulted in the(typical) looting Russia on a massive scale with the help of Al Gores buddy Larry Summers,USAID and Andrei Shleifer who orchestrated the oligarchic network in Russia – that was later removed and exiled by Putin.

That’s why the US olygarchic complex loves him so much.

(and whatever happened to those close relations with Russia since then?

Seems when a country stops dancing to the US tune and only tries to mind its own business it becomes an enemy)

One also starts to get the idea that the end of the Soviet Union was not some kind of natural development ,but a very deliberate and orchestrated thing.

Pretty much as the current downfall of the USA.

But that’s just a crazy conspiracy theory.

Al Gore, the Joel Osteen of the Church of Warming/Climate, “Pass the plate, I need another jet”

as I have stated before, IMO, agore began the destruction of the Republic with his “reinvention of government” in the early 90s. He, Congress and the Clinton Admin began picking winners and losers based on political considerations rather than actual need, merit or national security

 by Leo Hohmann, Leo Hohmann:

Using duplicity, deception and secret alliances, the U.K.’s inner circle of top elites led by Nathaniel Rothschild, King Edward VII, and Lord Alfred Milner backed the German Kaiser into a corner and intentionally set the Germans up to blame them for starting the First World War, when in fact it was the British who provoked the Germans to the point where war was the only option.

German generals were caught strategizing several weeks ago on how to bomb Russia’s main bridge to Crimea. This would be an act of aggression that Russian President Vladimir Putin described as guaranteed to draw a harsh military response from Russia, possibly even including a nuclear strike against Berlin.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

And that has led to an admission by German officials that their military is woefully unprepared to take on Russia. If German generals and politicians truly want to provoke a war with Russia, they had better slow down and wait for their military to catch up to the political rhetoric coming out of Berlin.

A March 14 article by John Cody at Remix News shows that the German Army lacks the personnel, equipment and infrastructure to wage a major war of any kind, let alone with a nuclear-armed military superpower like Russia.

“Germany’s own military and government are painting such a dire picture of the armed forces that there are now calls from some of the most powerful politicians in the country to reinstate mandatory military service,” Cody writes.

Yes, a military draft.

A video produced by Remix News details testimony provided by Eva Högl, German Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, who provided catastrophic details about the state of the German military. It is shocking in terms of its candor regarding the current state of the German armed forces.

She finds it “really impressive” that Germany has emptied out its military defense stocks by handing it over to Ukraine to be wasted in a losing war with Russia. That sounds like an admission of treason in the wide open.

But wait. There’s more.

Germany knows it is incapable of taking on Russia so it is negotiating a secret deal with the insane leaders of two other European countries, France and Poland, for the very purpose of sending troops into Ukraine separate from NATO, although I do not believe this could truly be done without the acquiescence of Washington and London.

An organization called the Weimar Triangle – composed of France, Germany and Poland – has been in existence since 1991 at the fall of the Soviet Union.

The stated purpose of the Weimar Triangle was to assist Poland’s emergence from Communist rule. It’s strange that it still exists but it may have found a new purpose – instigating World War III with Russia.

According to Wikipedia, “the Weimar Triangle exists mostly in the form of summit meetings between the leaders of the three countries and of their foreign ministers. The collaboration between member states includes inter-parliamentary contacts, military, scientific and cultural co-operation. The most recent summit of leaders occurred in Paris on June 12, 2023.” (Emphasis mine)",EN,"['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Russia will also attack other countries', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: By continuing the war we risk WWIII']",nato power u.k world war model lure russia big global war leo hohmann leo hohmann duplicity deception secret alliance u.k inner circle elite lead nathaniel rothschild king edward vii lord alfred milner back german kaiser corner intentionally set germans blame start world war fact british provoke germans point war option german general catch strategize week ago bomb russia main bridge crimea act aggression russian president vladimir putin describe guarantee draw harsh military response russia possibly include nuclear strike berlin truth live https://sgtreport.tv/ lead admission german official military woefully unprepared russia german general politician truly want provoke war russia well slow wait military catch political rhetoric come berlin march article john cody remix news show german army lack personnel equipment infrastructure wage major war kind let nuclear armed military superpower like russia germany military government paint dire picture armed force call powerful politician country reinstate mandatory military service cody write yes military draft video produce remix news detail testimony provide eva högl german parliamentary commissioner armed force provide catastrophic detail state german military shocking term candor current state german armed force new germany bring draft country army fall apart government openly admit pic.twitter.com/kxwkpwddsd remix news view @rmxnews march find impressive germany empty military defense stock hand ukraine waste lose war russia sound like admission treason wide open wait germany know incapable take russia negotiate secret deal insane leader european country france poland purpose send troop ukraine separate nato believe truly acquiescence washington london organization call weimar triangle compose france germany poland existence fall soviet union state purpose weimar triangle assist poland emergence communist rule strange exist find new purpose instigate world war iii russia accord wikipedia weimar triangle exist form summit meeting leader country foreign minister collaboration member state include inter parliamentary contact military scientific cultural co operation recent summit leader occur paris june emphasis

 Putin’s unwillingness to use sufficient force to end a conflict that should not have lasted one week is leading to much wider war.

NATO at the summit in Vilnius is likely to approve plans to increase the number of troops in a state of high alert to 300,000, as well as other changes in the military structure, said Secretary General Stoltenberg.

Plans to increase the number of its rapid reaction forces to more than 300 thousand. people from 40,000. Stoltenberg said in June 2022. He noted that this will take place within the framework of the implementation of new regional plans.

In May, Stoltenberg said that these plans would be described as a bloc to deter and protect NATO allies from any aggression: they contain precise demands for the transformation of the armed forces, including their deployment. The Secretary General also announced more Allied exercises, bringing more forces into combat readiness, strengthening the command structure and control in the alliance.

As reported in March, the increase in the number of the military may imply the emergence of two echelons. The first will be 100,000. soldiers ready to be sent within ten days. The second echelon is reinforcements, that is, the military sent for support, they will have to be ready for the transfer within 10-30 days.

The Spanish El Pais reported in May that the bloc was finalizing a common strategy to counter the threat from Russia and terrorism. This strategy, according to sources of the publication, is changing NATO’s approaches to deploying forces in different regions and responding to threats from Moscow.

West Virginia Treasurer Riley Moore lead the way earlier this year in removing Wall Street financial firms from holding state funds due to ‘Environmental, Social and Governance’ or ‘ESG’ climate change ideology driving investment decisions.

West Virginia had been the tip of the spear since early 2021 {link} removing Blackrock in January of 2022, and even removed banking contracts from multiple investment firms during the battle and asked other states to join in the effort {link}.

Today, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis announced the DeSantis administration would be following the lead from West Virginia.

[FLORIDA] – […] State Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis announced Thursday that Florida will immediately freeze about $1.43 billion in long-term securities and about $600 million in short-term overnight investments managed by BlackRock because of the firm’s use of “Environmental, Social, and Governance” standards — known as ESG.

Patronis in a prepared statement said he doesn’t “trust BlackRock’s ability to deliver” and “BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is on a campaign to change the world.”

“Whether stakeholder capitalism, or ESG standards, are being pushed by BlackRock for ideological reasons, or to develop social credit ratings, the effect is to avoid dealing with the messiness of democracy,” Patronis said.

Republican leaders in Florida and across the country have targeted ESG ratings, which can involve considering a wide range of issues in investments, such as companies’ climate-change vulnerabilities; carbon emissions; racial inequality; product safety; supply-chain labor standards; privacy and data security; and executive compensation.

Patronis said the state Department of Financial Services oversees about $60 billion and that the money with BlackRock will be moved “elsewhere.” (read more)

As part of the ongoing 2024 positioning effort, the ConInc influencers in/around Florida Governor Ron DeSantis attempted to claim Florida had led the way on the initiative. However, the reality of DeSantis as a bandwagoneer is brutally obvious to anyone who followed the previous effort and the backlash against West Virginia.

It’s good to see Florida join the effort.

I’m glad Florida followed West Virginia’s lead in pulling money away from BlackRock.

The current system has “run out of steam,” the president told supporters in a campaign speech Joe Biden speaks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington DC, October 19, 2023 © AP / Jonathan Ernst

The current US-led world order has “sort of run out of steam,” but Washington will shape the system that replaces it, US President Joe Biden told supporters on Saturday. Leaders in Moscow and Beijing, however, have argued otherwise.

Speaking at a campaign reception in Washington, Biden bragged about how he convinced Japan and South Korea to send financial aid to Ukraine, and how he signed a rail and ports deal with the EU, India, and Saudi Arabia at the G20 summit in New Delhi last month.

“So, I think we have an opportunity to do things, if we’re bold enough and have enough confidence in ourselves, to unite the world in ways that it never has been,” Biden declared.

“We were in a post-war period for 50 years where it worked pretty damn well, but that’s sort of run out of steam. Sort of run out of steam. We need a new, new world order in a sense,” he continued.

The world order that emerged following the Second World War was a bipolar one, with the US and USSR vying for influence and geopolitical supremacy. The collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in a unipolar world order, with the US the sole superpower. As the USSR disintegrated, then-US President George HW Bush proclaimed victory in the Cold War and the dawning of a “new world order” in his 1991 State of the Union address.

Three decades later, and with Washington scrambling for funds to fight two foreign wars, American dominance is less assured. China’s economy was the world’s eleventh largest in 1991, but is now second to only the US’. With Beijing expanding its nuclear arsenal and modernizing its military, President Xi Jinping has referred to the US-led West as “declining” on multiple occasions, and hailed the emergence of a “multipolar world,” in which international relations are governed by laws and treaties, rather than US-enforced “rules.”",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is weak']",build new world order biden current system run steam president tell supporter campaign speech joe biden speak oval office white house washington dc october ap jonathan ernst current lead world order sort run steam washington shape system replace president joe biden tell supporter saturday leader moscow beijing argue speak campaign reception washington biden brag convince japan south korea send financial aid ukraine sign rail port deal eu india saudi arabia summit new delhi month think opportunity thing bold confidence unite world way biden declare post war period year work pretty damn sort run steam sort run steam need new new world order sense continue world order emerge follow second world war bipolar ussr vie influence geopolitical supremacy collapse soviet union usher unipolar world order sole superpower ussr disintegrate president george hw bush proclaim victory cold war dawning new world order state union address decade later washington scramble fund fight foreign war american dominance assured china economy world eleventh large second beijing expand nuclear arsenal modernize military president xi jinping refer lead west decline multiple occasion hail emergence multipolar world international relation govern law treaty enforce rule

 NATO Troops Are Operating In Ukraine Disguised As Mercenaries, Russian General Claims

By Magyar Nemzet of Remix News

A Russian general is claiming that NATO troops are in Ukraine, but they are being disguised as mercenaries to justify their presence, with a number of American and Polish bodies found in Avdiivka, the city recently captured by Russian forces over the last few days.

In an interview with Russian newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda, General Sergei Rudskoy, chief operations director of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, said that NATO military personnel are taking part in the fighting in Ukraine disguised as mercenaries.

“NATO soldiers are taking part in the fighting disguised as mercenaries. They control air defense systems for operational and tactical missiles and multiple rocket launchers, and are part of assault teams,” Rudskoy said. According to him, NATO officers directly shape the military operations of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

The Russian state news agency TASS reported that the bodies of soldiers with Polish and American insignia on their clothes had been found in the Russian-controlled Avdiivka.

“The clearing of Avdiivka has revealed quite a few interesting details. In this case, bodies abandoned by Ukrainian armed units with American and Polish insignia sewn on their uniforms,” Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the head of the “Donetsk People’s Republic,” told Russia’s TASS/TRANS news agency.

This information cannot be independently verified.

Gen. Rudskoy claims that Ukraine is being used as a proxy against Russia.

“Western countries make no secret of their desire to inflict a strategic defeat on our country. In order to achieve this goal, Washington and Brussels have chosen Ukraine, where anti-Russian, nationalist sentiment has been nurtured since the collapse of the Soviet Union. At present, the Ukrainian people are being used by the United States as cannon fodder for its geopolitical ambitions of world domination. Therefore, the threats to our country today are no less serious than in the years of 1941-1945 last century,” said Gen. Rudskoy.

With the fall of Avdiivka, Ukraine has lost one of the most important cities on the Donetsk frontline, Many believe that the town is now serving as a second Bakhmut, as it was clear months ago that it could only be held temporarily at the cost of tens of thousands of soldiers’ lives.

EN_UA_300012.txt,Other,Other,"Russian Officer Shot at Enlistment Office Over Recruitment Fears 

 A young man shot a Russian military officer on Monday at an enlistment center, citing grievances of the Kremlin's partial mobilization for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, The Associated Press reported.

The attack was carried out in the Siberian city of Ust-Ilimsk by 25-year-old resident Ruslan Zinin, who reportedly walked into the center shouting ""no one will go to fight"" and ""we will all go home now"" before unloading on the officer.

Authorities said the officer was in intensive care as they announced Zinin's arrest — pledging the harshest possible punishment. According to local news, Zinin had been called up to fight by Moscow and was prepared for deployment on Tuesday.

The news comes as countless protests have sprung up across Russia in stark defiance of Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to partially mobilize those with ""certain military specialty and relevant experience"" last week.

In part, the backlash is due to several reports indicating the mobilization is far more expansive than officially decreed.

Evidence surfaced on Friday showing Russian authorities visiting Buryat State University, with one individual stating they were taking ""students straight from classes,"" Newsweek noted.

""The cops are on my campus, 10-15 people,"" a student wrote in a chat room, with a clip emerging one day later of military vehicles outside the building.

The news also breaks hours after a school shooting in the central Russian city of Izhevsk led to the deaths of 17 people, including 11 children, according to The Washington Post.

The suspected gunman is 34-year-old resident Artem Kazantsev, who reportedly brandished a Nazi armband during the attack and has a history of visiting his local psychological clinic.

Russian authorities have claimed the mass shooting incident, which injured at least 23 other people, is unconnected to Putin's order.

 The Washington Free Beacon reported that BioMADE, a public-private partnership that has received more than $500 million from the DoD, is responsible for the endeavor. BioMADE announced on its website on June 3 that it is looking for new ideas to reduce the CO2 emissions from food production and transport at military sites. These ideas include ""novel cell culture methods suitable for the production of cultivated meat or protein"" – essentially a euphemism for lab-grown fake meat.

Lab-grown meat is a new technology where animal muscle and fat tissues are grown from modified animal cells in special equipment. This process uses a mix of chemicals, pressure and temperature to create meat that resembles beef, chicken and pork. Though still in the experimental stage, lab-grown meat has sparked a debate about its efficiency and ethics of producing meat without killing animals. (Related: Lab-made chicken meat grown from CANCER CELLS receives FDA approval - Are you ready to eat TUMOR nuggets?)

But according to a 2023 study by researchers at the University of California-Davis, the carbon footprint of lab-grown beef might be worse than that of the product it seeks to replace. It zoomed in on the use of highly refined or purified growth media, which is used to help animal cells multiply. They wrote that lab-grown meat using purified media in its production has a global warming potential four to 25 times greater than the average compared to the real thing.

Critics argue that using U.S. troops to test lab-grown meat, which is still experimental and not widely available in stores, is inappropriate. Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved two California companies to sell cultured chicken to restaurants in 2023, some believe taxpayer money shouldn’t fund the lab-grown meat industry.

Jack Hubbard, executive director for the Center for the Environment and Welfare (CEW), was among the vocal critics of the plan. ""Taxpayer dollars should not be used to fund the lab-grown meat sector,"" he remarked.

""Our troops deserve better than to be served lab-grown meat, produced in bioreactors with immortalized cells and chemicals. Unfortunately, this effort is being driven by an agenda that is political and anti-farmer. Our soldiers should never be used as guinea pigs.""

Even Ethan Lane, vice president for government affairs at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, has criticized the DoD research grant that bankrolled BioMADE.

""It is outrageous that the DoD is spending millions of taxpayer dollars to feed our heroes like lab rats,"" he said in a statement. ""This misguided research project is a giant slap in the face to everyone that has served our country. Our veterans and active-duty troops deserve so much better than this.""

""U.S. cattle producers raise the highest-quality beef in the world, with the lowest carbon footprint – and American troops deserve to be served that same wholesome, natural meat and not ultra-processed, lab-grown protein that is cooked up in a chemical-filled bioreactor.""

SEP/IYSSE public meeting in Sri Lanka 

 The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.

In announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”

Israel’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.

The imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.

The Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.

One might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.

War is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.

Our comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.

In the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.

The ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.

The only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.

A struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt. The independent mobilisation of workers on this basis needs to take up the fight to free Assange and Syrotiuk as well.

The burning need is for a new revolutionary leadership in the working class based on socialist internationalism to abolish the source of militarism, austerity, authoritarianism and all sorts of social misery—the capitalist system.

British colonel: Ukrainian operation in Kursk region humiliated Putin and showed cowardice of allies

The first major attack on Russian territory since World War II, the Ukrainian Armed Forces' offensive in the Kursk region, has publicly humiliated Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. However, he is not the only one who was humiliated and stunned by the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces on Russian territory. Ukraine's partners, among those who provide weapons but restrict their use, are in the same position.

This is the opinion of Colonel Richard Justin Kemp, a retired British Army officer and knight, who was awarded the highest honor in the UK. In his opinion, the Ukrainian offensive ""showed the cowardice of the allies,"" especially US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

Sir Richard Kemp recalls how President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had previously asked Western partners to allow the use of long-range weapons to protect both Ukrainian soldiers and Ukraine in general.

""The British Storm Shadow missiles could make a difference in this battle, but the British government is unwilling to allow them to be used to their full potential. What, in Sir Keir Starmer's opinion, is the point of a strike on Russian territory, apart from protecting Ukraine? And how would the Second World War have ended if the Prime Minister had not allowed British and American bombs to fall on German soil?"" asks the colonel.

According to Sir Richard Kemp, throughout the entire period of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, ""the most pathetic were the Western allies"" who pursued a policy not based on Ukraine's defense needs, ""but on the groundless fear of Russian retaliation."" And although all of Putin's so-called red lines turned out to be nothing more than baseless intimidation, each subsequent Western decision to provide Ukraine with long-range missiles, tanks, or combat aircraft ""was reluctant, half-hearted, inadequate, and gripped by fear.""

Incidentally, it was these fears and the ""miserable policy"" of the partners that ensured the success of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in the Kursk region, the Briton believes.

""Ukraine was able to launch an unexpected attack on Russian territory because most of the border with the enemy was left almost unguarded. The fact is that Putin knew that his territory remained virtually invulnerable to attack because of Western restrictions on the use of weapons. This also applies to airfields, supply routes, and logistics bases. Significant forces needed to protect them have been thrown into the war in Ukraine,"" the colonel said.

""What Western leaders don't realize is that when you're facing a tyrant like Putin, escalation is the only language he fears and understands. We see the same thing in the Middle East, where Biden is pleading with Israel to de-escalate. But his unconvincing 'no' will not stop Ayatollah Khamenei from pushing the button and launching Iran's expected missile attack, just as it did not stop Putin from attacking Ukraine,"" Sir Richard Kemp said.

Ukraine's offensive near Kursk has taught the West a ""salutary lesson,"" the military said.

""Despite the capture of thousands of square kilometers of Russia's holy shrines, no nuclear missiles were raining down on Kyiv. The truth is that if Ukraine had been allowed to escalate from the very beginning, it could have brought this war to an end on favorable terms for Kyiv,"" the British colonel believes.

 Zelensky Enemy of Ukraine Sends In The Last Reserves

Will Putin’s army capture the formerly British Challengers and add them to his Moscow museum ?

Ukrainian troops deployed the last large forces near Rabotino

Kyiv sent the last strategic reserves of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (APU) to the area of the village of Rabotino, Zaporozhye region, according to the American magazine Forbes. This decision could significantly increase the region’s defense strength, but it also puts Ukraine in a potentially vulnerable position.

The deployed troops include the 82nd air assault brigade from the strategic reserve of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, equipped with Marder and Stryker armored vehicles, as well as Challenger 2 tanks. Forbes emphasizes that the 82nd and 46th air assault brigades were the last major formations that The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was kept in reserve to respond to possible threats.

While such a move could strengthen Ukraine’s defensive position in the Rabotino region in the short term, such large formations are not capable of sustaining combat operations indefinitely. It is emphasized that when these brigades need rest, repair and restoration, they will not be replaced by equally combat-ready and trained units.

 Proposed new emissions standards would ""move (the) U.S. car market decisively toward electric vehicles,"" the agency revealed, adding that it hopes to convert ""up to [two-thirds]"" of all cars sold to EV models by the year 2032.

If implemented, the EPA policy would force most new cars sold by that year to be EVs – no gas allowed, meaning they cannot even be hybrids. Not long after that, the agency hopes to axe all gas cars from the market entirely.

The program would be phased in starting in 2027, when all light-duty vehicles sold new will need to meet new greenhouse gas performance standards. By 2032, between 64 and 67 percent of all new car sales would need to be EVs only.

""This is the planned rationing of vehicles,"" says Marc Morano of The Climate Depot. ""The planned rationing of American cars. That's the only way this plan makes sense ... the only result is going to be shortages of cars and a completely altered used car market.""

(Related: In case you missed it, the Biden regime also proposed a nationwide ban on gas stoves last fall, but then relented due to widespread unpopularity.)

As explained by Morano, all of this is exactly what happened to places like Cuba and East Germany, which succumbed to communism under similar circumstances.

""You can look to Cuba to find out what it's like to have a raging used car market because that's what we're looking at here,"" he warns.

""And you can look to old East Germany. East Germany had their famed Trabant car, where people would have to get on waiting lists for years to get one, and that's what we're faced with here when the government is going to mandate that you can only buy a new electric car.""

The left-wing obsession with all things electric is nonsensical from the perspective of affordability and reliability. Earth-based fuels like oil and gas are abundant, inexpensive, and highly reliable, while electric power is expensive, unreliable, and just plain stupid.

How will the average person power his EV in the event of a power outage? What about when he becomes stranded out in the middle of nowhere with no charging stations anywhere in sight?

In the United States, at least, there is still time to stop this madness. Our country does not have to go the way of Australia, where some banks are now refusing to finance loans for people wanting to purchase gas-powered vehicles.

The World Bank is also moving in the same direction, having promised to phase out all funding for gas-powered cars in the shockingly near term.

""The powers that be, the corporate world, the bankers, the governments, academia – they've decided that gas-powered cars are over and they're putting all the forces into play to end it without our say in it,"" Morano warns.

Then we have the Biden regime, which wants the imposition of new pollution limits that would force at least 54 percent of all new vehicles to be sold as electric models by the year 2030.

""I believe it's pretty doable,"" said Margo Oge, chair of the International Council on Clean Transportation and a former Obama regime EPA official. ""The industry is there. Europe is ahead of the U.S., China is ahead of Europe, and these companies are global companies.""

Everything big government is trying to do aims to stamp out freedom and liberty – but in the name of ""saving the planet."" To learn more, visit GreenTyranny.news.

EN_CC_100010.txt,Other,Other,"Leveraging Chinese expertise to help Pakistan expedite real estate growth 

 Pakistan’s collaboration with Chinese construction companies offers a unique opportunity to leverage their vast expertise to expedite its infrastructure and real estate development and adopt efficient construction techniques while ensuring high-quality standards and promoting sustainable practices.

Dr. Liaqat Ali Shah, Head of Policy CPEC in the Centre of Excellence for CPEC, said this while talking to WealthPK.

“The Chinese investment under the CPEC is mainly focused on infrastructure. The largest part went into setting up power generation plants, railway tracks, and building highway infrastructure. The CPEC's western alignment was also the focus of new infrastructure projects, which connected Pakistan's most underdeveloped regions with Gwadar and major urban centres.”

“Owing to China’s rapid urbanization in the last two decades, Chinese construction companies have had a lot of exposure to efficient construction techniques, which has given them a lot of expertise in these fields,” he said.

“Collaborating with Chinese construction firms allows Pakistan to benefit from these high-quality standards, contributing to the construction of a durable and resilient infrastructure. This is particularly crucial in regions prone to natural disasters, as the expertise garnered from the Chinese practices can help in designing and constructing buildings that can withstand various environmental challenges,” he opined.

“As the world collectively embraces the imperative of sustainable development, the Pak-China partnership aligns seamlessly with these global goals. Both nations recognize the importance of environment-friendly construction practices and adoption of green building materials.”

“Through joint research initiatives and knowledge-sharing, the collaboration will be instrumental in achieving the targets related to climate action and responsible consumption and production.”

“Implementing focused training programs and knowledge-sharing initiatives is crucial for cultivating a skilled and competitive construction workforce in Pakistan,” he suggested.

 Top European human rights court cites Russia violations in Crimea

THE HAGUE, Netherlands — Europe’s top human rights court has ruled that Russia was responsible for a string of human rights violations in Crimea since overrunning and later illegally annexing the Black Sea peninsula in 2014.

The European Court of Human Rights said in a lengthy written judgment this week that Moscow was responsible for rights violations including reining in freedom of expression, religion and assembly.

Russia also breached international humanitarian law by imposing its laws on the occupied peninsula, the Strasbourg, France-based court ruled.

The court said there was “a pattern of retaliatory prosecution and misuse of criminal law and a general crackdown on political opposition to Russian policies in Crimea, which had been developed and publicly promoted by prominent representatives of the Russian authorities.”

Ukrainian President Zelensky is all over Europe, including at the G-7. His message? Ukraine’s war with Russia and Putin is Europe’s fight, too.

The court is the legal arm of the Council of Europe, the continent’s foremost human rights body, which expelled Russia from its ranks more than two years ago after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The expulsion means that the court has no enforcement powers over Russia.

However, the ruling could bolster cases filed by individuals seeking reparations.

Moscow maintains that it rightfully took over Crimea after an overwhelming majority of local residents voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in a referendum. It has continuously rejected accusations of human rights violations in the region.

Ukraine and most Western governments, including the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany, condemned the annexation of Crimea as illegal, calling the referendum a sham.

In the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia, a Russia-style bill targeting civil society and independent media nears final enactment amid protests. Critics see a Kremlin hand.

In its written ruling, the court found Russia responsible for breaches including enforced disappearances and the abuse of Ukrainian soldiers, ethnic Ukrainians, Crimean Tatars and journalists.

It also held Moscow responsible for discrimination including the harassment and intimidation of religious leaders, cracking down on non-Russian media, banning public gatherings and expressions of support for Ukraine, and suppressing the Ukrainian language in schools.

The decision Tuesday by the human rights court comes six months after the top United Nations court ruled that Moscow breached an international treaty on eradicating racial discrimination by limiting school education in Ukrainian and by maintaining a ban on a Tatar assembly called the Mejlis.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],european court say russia breach right crimea takeover european human right court cite russia violation crimea hague netherland europe human right court rule russia responsible string human right violation crimea overrun later illegally annex black sea peninsula european court human right say lengthy write judgment week moscow responsible right violation include rein freedom expression religion assembly russia breach international humanitarian law impose law occupy peninsula strasbourg france base court rule court say pattern retaliatory prosecution misuse criminal law general crackdown political opposition russian policy crimea develop publicly promote prominent representative russian authority ukrainian president zelensky europe include g- message ukraine war russia putin europe fight court legal arm council europe continent foremost human right body expel russia rank year ago russia scale invasion ukraine expulsion mean court enforcement power russia ruling bolster case file individual seek reparation moscow maintain rightfully take crimea overwhelming majority local resident vote secede ukraine join russia referendum continuously reject accusation human right violation region ukraine western government include u.s u.k france germany condemn annexation crimea illegal call referendum sham ex soviet republic georgia russia style bill target civil society independent medium near final enactment amid protest critic kremlin hand write ruling court find russia responsible breach include enforce disappearance abuse ukrainian soldier ethnic ukrainian crimean tatar journalist hold moscow responsible discrimination include harassment intimidation religious leader crack non russian medium ban public gathering expression support ukraine suppress ukrainian language school decision tuesday human right court come month united nations court rule moscow breach international treaty eradicate racial discrimination limit school education ukrainian maintain ban tatar assembly call mejlis

 THIS is the horrifying moment Russia appeared to unleash flesh-melting ""thermite bombs"" on a Ukrainian town.

Terrifying footage shows the night sky in Marinka lit up by a chilling rain of sparkling, burning thermite - a killer chemical mixture.

The video, taken through a smashed window by someone sheltering inside a building, shows a huge area of the town in the Donetsk region being showered with the horror bombs.

Ukrainian journalists shared the video on Twitter - describing it as the ""scariest footage of thermite shelling"" they had ever seen.

Marinka is on the frontline of Putin's war in Ukraine as Moscow tries to gain control of the Donbas region - made up of the Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.

Thermite, a mixture of metal powder and metal oxide, is used in the making of incendiary bombs.

It burns at temperatures of more than 2,400C - being so hot it can burn through steel and concrete.

And if it comes into contact with human flesh, it can melt through right down to the bone.

Human Rights Watch previously warned the deadly weapon can cause extremely painful burns on the human skin and can lead to respiratory problems.

The bombs use is significantly dangerous as their wide area of range means they cannot be contained on the battlefield - and its effects could hit civilians.

The killer weapons were used during the Second World War.

The use of thermite as an incendiary weapon is nowadays considered a war crime.

Its use was banned by the third protocol of the 1980 UN Convention on Conventional Weapons in Geneva.

Russia was previously accused of using phosphorus bombs in its effort to take over the Mariupol steel plant Azovstal in May this year.

Dramatic footage showed a Russian missile detonating mid-air above the plant with flaming explosives dropping down.

Ukrainian officials claimed the clip showed Russian forces dropping 9M22S incendiary and phosphorus bombs on the steelworks.

EN_CC_100009.txt,Other,Other,"Interview: Chinese wisdom aids sustainable development of new World Heritage Site 

 BEIJING, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er, southwest China, embodies the wisdom of China's agrarian culture and is an example of positive interaction between people and nature, and of their sustainable development, a Chinese official has said.

Li Qun, deputy minister of culture and tourism and head of the National Cultural Heritage Administration, made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua. The site was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List on Sunday during the extended 45th session of the World Heritage Committee ongoing in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

With the addition of this new listing, China's number of UNESCO World Heritage sites has risen to 57. The Cultural Landscape of Old Tea Forests of the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er is the very first tea-themed world cultural heritage site globally.

On what makes this site stand out and on what sort of cultural insights it offers, Li said the cultural landscape comprises five ancient tea forests, nine traditional villages and three protective forests, which maintain their vitality to this day.

""According to archaeological findings, the cultivation of tea trees in ancient China can be traced back over 6,000 years,"" Li said. ""Subsequently, tea culture and the practice of growing and consuming tea spread from China to neighboring countries and beyond.""

The cultural landscape has resulted in a unique protection system combining government management with grassroots governance, which ensures the protection of cultural and biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources, Li said.

This heritage, he said, also demonstrates the unique tradition of the complementary use of natural resources in mountainous environments by many of China's ethnic groups.

Its success in achieving World Heritage Site status is ""a significant achievement in presenting an authentic picture of ancient and modern China to the world,"" the official said.

China plans to implement preservation and management initiatives in five key areas, Li said.

Emphasizing the importance of prioritizing protection and planning ahead, Li highlighted the need for the coordinated planning of protection and management measures for ancient tea forests, villages and traditional residential architecture. Such an approach aims to strike a balance between heritage preservation and development.

Furthermore, China intends to invest in research on core technologies to enhance its monitoring capabilities for ancient tea forests as well as rare flora and rare fauna, and its capabilities for climate change responses.

To promote the sustainable development of its heritage sites, China aims to improve the participation mechanism for locals and other stakeholders. The involvement of local communities, particularly people from younger generations, will be encouraged and guided to contribute to the dissemination of tea culture and the growth of the tea industry.

China will continue to delve into the history of the tea industry, explore the philosophical depth of tea culture, and elucidate the global influence of Chinese tea culture. The country seeks to tap into the value of this heritage and promote its traditional culture further.

The official said that efforts are underway to promote the effective utilization and regulated development of cultural World Heritage Sites, aiming to breathe new life into these invaluable treasures. ■",EN,['Other'],['Other'],interview chinese wisdom aid sustainable development new world heritage site beijing sept xinhua cultural landscape old tea forest jingmai mountain pu'er southwest china embody wisdom china agrarian culture example positive interaction people nature sustainable development chinese official say li qun deputy minister culture tourism head national cultural heritage administration remark interview xinhua site inscribe unesco world heritage list sunday extend th session world heritage committee ongoing riyadh saudi arabia addition new listing china number unesco world heritage site rise cultural landscape old tea forest jingmai mountain pu'er tea theme world cultural heritage site globally make site stand sort cultural insight offer li say cultural landscape comprise ancient tea forest traditional village protective forest maintain vitality day accord archaeological finding cultivation tea tree ancient china trace year li say subsequently tea culture practice grow consume tea spread china neighboring country cultural landscape result unique protection system combine government management grassroots governance ensure protection cultural biological diversity sustainable use natural resource li say heritage say demonstrate unique tradition complementary use natural resource mountainous environment china ethnic group success achieve world heritage site status significant achievement present authentic picture ancient modern china world official say china plan implement preservation management initiative key area li say emphasize importance prioritize protection planning ahead li highlight need coordinated planning protection management measure ancient tea forest village traditional residential architecture approach aim strike balance heritage preservation development furthermore china intend invest research core technology enhance monitoring capability ancient tea forest rare flora rare fauna capability climate change response promote sustainable development heritage site china aim improve participation mechanism local stakeholder involvement local community particularly people young generation encourage guide contribute dissemination tea culture growth tea industry china continue delve history tea industry explore philosophical depth tea culture elucidate global influence chinese tea culture country seek tap value heritage promote traditional culture official say effort underway promote effective utilization regulated development cultural world heritage site aim breathe new life invaluable treasure

 A group of mostly unelected globalist oligarchs met in December and decided, for the third decade in a row, to stretch the truth about their efforts to fight “climate change” by cutting fossil fuel emissions.

Unelected representatives from almost 200 countries flew to Dubai in December (on their private jets) to discuss how us poors are ruining their planet by using gas stoves and the like, Reuters reported, using far more diplomatic terms. These “representatives” at Dubai’s COP28 summit decided to unite in putting an end to fossil fuels … literally the same thing they’ve said they wanted to do since the Kyoto Protocol of December 1997.

The Kyoto Protocol was one of the first annual “summits” held by unelected Bond villains who want to decide our fate. At the time, the countries present decided to cut fossil fuel use around the world, lest we be dead or drowning within a decade or two, which turned out to be a lie.

Almost 30 years later, these idiots still think they deserve a big annual party to celebrate the hoax that they’re doing a damn thing to help our species work in symbiosis with the natural environment.

 Russia threatens nukes for US, UK, Finland if NATO expands

Vladimir Putin warned the president of Finland Saturday that any effort to join NATO would “negatively” affect relations between the two countries.

The comments followed another Russian leader’s threat to use the Satan-2 hypersonic nuclear missile to strike Britain and Finland “in just 200 seconds” — and that the weapons could be used to hit the United States as well.

As NATO foreign ministers gathered in Berlin, with discussion about potential applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western military alliance on the agenda, Putin spoke to Finnish leader Sauli Niinisto.

Nijnisto told Putin in the phone conversation that the traditionally non-aligned country “will decide to apply for NATO membership in the coming days.”

Finland and Sweden, also traditionally neutral, are moving toward the applications in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In response, Russia cut off electricity supplies to Finland on Friday.

Putin told Niinisto that Finland’s abandonment “of its traditional policy of military neutrality would be an error since there are no threats to Finland’s security,” the Kremlin said in a statement issued after the call. “Such a change in the country’s foreign policy could negatively affect Russian-Finnish relations, which had been built in the spirit of good neighborliness and partnership for many years, and were mutually beneficial.”

Niinisto’s office said in a statement that he told Putin how starkly Finland’s security environment had changed after Moscow’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

The exchange came amid escalating rhetoric over the potential for NATO to expand beyond its current 30 members.

“If Finland wants to join this bloc, then our goal is absolutely legitimate — to question the existence of this state. This is logical,” said Aleksey Zhuravlyov, 59, the deputy chairman of the Russian parliament’s defense committee, said in an interview with The Mirror. “The Finns in general should be grateful to Russia for their statehood, for the fact that Finland exists as a country.”

“If the United States threatens our state, it’s good: here is the Sarmat [Satan-2] for you, and there will be nuclear ashes from you if you think that Russia should not exist,” he continued. “And Finland says that it is at one with the USA. Well, get in line.”

The Satan-2 is a ballistic missile capable of carrying 10 to 15 nuclear warheads, with an estimated destructive power of three megatons each.

Russia wouldn’t need to move nukes to its European border to carry out its threat, officials boasted.

“We can hit with a Sarmat [known in the West as Satan-2] from Siberia, and even reach the UK,” he said. “And if we strike from Kaliningrad … the hypersonic’s reaching time is 200 seconds – so go ahead, guys.

“On the Finnish border we will have not strategic weapons, but Kinzhal-class, one that will reach Finland in 20 seconds, or even 10 seconds.”

 As the world is becoming more and more aware about the dangers of climate change, various countries are trying to embrace the green energy. China is among those nations that are serious about using renewable sources of energy. Norwegian diplomat and former politician, Erik Solheim recently informed via his Twitter handle that the photovoltaic (PV) power plants of China increased their production capacity to 392.61 GW in 2022. Solheim added that the China’s export of PV products grew by 80 per cent to $51.3 billion, and nearly 46 per cent of it went to Europe. He also shared a video clip where hundreds of solar panels can be seen in a solar park.

Wang Bohua, honorary chairman of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association, said that China’s export of solar product exceeded $50 billion for the first time last year, as mentioned in a report by Yicai Global. The export comprised panels worth $42.4 billion, silicon wafers of value $5.1 billion, and batteries amounting to $3.8 billion.

Among the main PV products, the polysilicon production of China jumped 63 per cent to 827,000 tons last year, according to Wang. Wang added that the cell production increased 61 per cent to 318 GW, while panel and wafer production increased by 59 per cent and 58 per cent to 288.7 GW and 357 GW, respectively.

In a recent development, US imports of solar panels have begun to pick up after months of gridlock stemming from the implementation of a new law that bans goods produced with forced labour, as told by two Chinese solar companies to Reuters. A White House official attributed the thaw in shipments to clearer rules for complying with the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA).

The gains come as a relief to major Chinese suppliers like Trina Solar and Jinko Solar. These suppliers are now finally getting products into the lucrative market of United States after long delays. Under the labour protection law, imports of products made in China’s Xinjiang region are prohibited. Chinese authorities have reportedly established labour camps for ethnic Uyghur and other Muslim groups in the Xinjiang region.

(Xinhua/Guo Xulei)

BEIJING, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- China strives to make frontier breakthroughs in science and technology via the advancing computing power of artificial intelligence (AI) that has seen explosive growth in the country.

Scientists and AI developers applauded the revolution of AI-driven scientific research at the two-day AI for Science Summit in Beijing, which started on Thursday.

""AI development benefited from science,"" said Tang Chao, a professor from the Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies (AAIS) at Peking University, at the meeting. ""Now, we're looking forward to embracing a stage where AI facilitates scientific progress.""

AI for Science (AI4Science) can form an interdisciplinary platform and help scientists to solve complicated problems to improve research efficiency and quality, said E Weinan, president of the AI for Science Institute in Beijing.

AI4Science demands four pillars of infrastructure -- algorithm models and software, effective measures to represent experimental data, database and knowledge repository, and integrated computing platform, said E.

The Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Natural Science Foundation of China jointly kickstarted a project to promote the use of AI in frontier sci-tech research in March.

The project will deploy AI models and algorithms in gene research and biology breeding breakthroughs.

Also, interdisciplinary research and development teams will be brought together to promote the establishment of an innovation consortium and build international academic exchange platforms to offer solutions to human scientific challenges, including cancer treatment and the climate crisis.

E said AI4Science might bring revolutionary changes in new materials, energy, aviation, and pharmaceuticals.

Using AI and one of the world's fastest supercomputers, Chinese scientists have already started to engineer otherwise unknown chemicals to be clinically used in the future.

With the Tianhe-2 supercomputer in south China's Guangdong Province, scientists and computer experts with Beijing-based AI startup Galixir developed a practical deep-learning toolkit to predict the biosynthetic pathways for natural products, the primary source of clinical drug discovery.

Empowered by AI-based algorithms, the computer also offers clinicians tools to discern types of gastric cancer and discover signs of nasopharynx cancer among high-risk populations.

The new application scenarios are also a source of opportunities for the AI industry.

EN_UA_300028.txt,Other,Other,"Putin Grants Russian Citizenship to NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden 

 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 26 granted full Russian citizenship to Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor who leaked information about the U.S. agency’s widespread domestic surveillance operations during the Obama administration.

Snowden, 39, fled to Russia in 2013 from the United States after he posted secret files that revealed the NSA’s operations. U.S. authorities have for years sought to bring Snowden back and arrest him on espionage charges.

The former NSA contractor was granted permanent Russian residency in 2020. At the time, Snowden said he planned to apply for Russian citizenship and wouldn’t renounce his U.S. citizenship. In 2020, a U.S. appeals court found that the program Snowden had exposed was unlawful and said that U.S. officials who had publicly defended it weren’t telling the truth.

“Will Snowden be drafted?” Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the state media outlet RT, wrote in a darkly humorous tone on her Telegram channel. She was referring to last week’s speech from Putin in which the Russian leader said he would partially mobilize his country’s forces amid the Ukraine conflict.

‘I Didn’t Cooperate’Putin, a former KGB official, publicly stated in 2017 that Snowden was wrong to leak intelligence secrets but didn’t believe him to be a traitor to the United States.

 4th International Conference on SIDS: Transforming SIDS Economies through Energy Transition and Climate Action towards Prosperity, Resilience and Sustainable Development

Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have emerged as frontrunners in the global fight against climate change. The island states have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to the principles outlined in the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A pivotal aspect of their dedication lies in the ambitious targets set to transition towards resilient renewable energy systems, thereby reducing fossil fuel dependency, enhancing economic resilience, and addressing pressing socio-economic challenges. The realization of SIDS' renewable energy commitments hinges upon robust partnerships with financing institutions, development partners, and relevant stakeholders for providing financial assistance, technology transfer, and capacity-building support. Collaborative efforts are vital to bolstering SIDS' resilience and prosperity through energy sector transformation.

IRENA through the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative aims to convene SIDS representatives, development partners, regional and multilateral organizations, financing institutions, and other stakeholders. Through strategic deliberations, the event sought to identify innovative financing mechanisms, facilitate technology transfer, and outline capacity-building initiatives crucial for SIDS to achieve their renewable energy commitments.

Furthermore, the key discussion points during the side event took into consideration the following aspects:

- Exploring innovative financing mechanisms tailored to the unique challenges faced by SIDS.

- Facilitating technology transfer and knowledge sharing to accelerate renewable energy adoption.

- Identifying capacity-building needs and strategies to enhance SIDS' resilience and expertise in renewable energy development.

- Fostering partnerships and collaborations to mobilize resources and support SIDS' energy transition efforts.

The expected outcomes of the side event gauged how the SIDS Lighthouses Initiative and similar SIDS focussed initiatives can facilitate:

- Enhanced understanding of the financing landscape and available mechanisms for supporting SIDS' renewable energy projects.

- Concrete strategies and action plans for facilitating technology transfer and capacity-building initiatives in SIDS.

- Strengthened partnerships and commitments towards advancing renewable energy transformation in SIDS.

 Putin Says West Prepared To Scapegoat Zelensky For War Failures: 'Replaced By Next Year'

Russian President Vladimir Putin is in Vietnam, where he signed at least a dozen energy and trade deals with the country's President To Lam, on his tour to shore up ties in Asia in an effort to offset the West's drive to isolate Moscow.

On his last day in the country he made some wide-ranging remarks to the press, and among the most interesting was a statement on the future of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Putin predicted at a moment things are going very badly for Ukrainian forces, and at a rare time Western media seems to be turning on Zelensky, that the Ukrainian leader will soon be replaced over his poor and unpopular decision-making. Putin suggested Washington is essentially going to make him a scapegoat.

""In the West, they simply do not want to replace him [Zelenskyy], the time is not right. I think it's obvious to anyone. They will blame all unpopular decisions on him, including lowering the [military] draft age, and that's it,"" Putin asserted, according to Russian media translation.

That's when he followed with: ""And then they'll replace him. I think it will happen sometime in the first half of next year.""

Putin could be at least in part seizing on the obvious increased negative coverage of the Zelensky government in major Western media outlets, from the BBC to NY Times to Wall Street Journal. Indeed Zelensky's 'celebrity power' on display throughout the first part of the war, where it seemed he could simply do no wrong in the media's eyes, is waning fast.

More importantly, there are signs of large-scale dissent among the Ukrainian population as recruitment officers violently grab men from off the streets.

Despite Kiev forces clearly being against the ropes of late, Zelensky has still refused to even contemplate negotiating. He has stood by his earlier commitment to not enter dialogue toward ceasefire until Putin is out of power. Putin commented on this while in Vietnam:

Talks on Ukraine could take place as early as tomorrow, but Russia will use the current situation as a starting point, the president added.

""We have been conducting these behind-the-scenes talks, and what we hoped for has failed,"" Putin told reporters.

Zelensky's advisor, Alexey Arestovich, argued in 2019:— Glenn Diesen (@Glenn_Diesen) April 9, 2024

- Attempting to join NATO will pressure Russia to invade

- ""Our price for joining NATO is a big war with Russia""

 Moscow: Some Russian officials including those working on Putin’s 2024 re-election campaign have been directed to immediately stop using iPhones as they are more at risk from hackers and espionage than other smartphones. 
According to separate reports published in the state newspapers - The Moscow Times and Kommersant, the workers have been told that they have until April 1, 2023 to either throw their iPhones or give them to children. As per reports, Kremlin’s first deputy chief of staff Sergei Kiriyenko issued the ‘Final word’ directive on iPhones on Monday. Those asked to abide were officials working in the presidential administration’s domestic policy, public projects, State Council, and IT departments. The directive took place during a seminar in the Moscow region earlier this month, according to the Russian newspaper, which cited sources present at the meeting. According to the Kommersant report which cited an unnamed source, officials have been instructed to replace even the finest iPhones with phones built on other smartphone software, such as Android, Chinese counterparts, or Aurora, an operating system developed by the Russian company Open Mobile Platform. 

It’s interesting that this is happening at a time when governments all over the world are removing China’s TikTok from their systems and networks due to similar worries. The Moscow Times reports that the rumored iPhone prohibition coincides with the Russian government’s efforts to wean its citizens away from Western technology by establishing a “sovereign mobile ecosystem” based on the Avrora operating system. One seminar attendee was quoted in the Kommersant report as saying, “It’s all over for the iPhone: either throw it away or give it to the children”. Besides this, the Kremlin officials are not allowed to use smartphones for any official reasons. “It makes no difference what they are. 

Regardless of the running system—Android or iOS—any smartphone is a fairly transparent device. Naturally, they are not utilized for formal functions,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. The alleged directive, reports claim coincides with ongoing campaign planning for the forthcoming Russian presidential election in 2024. Apple ceased selling products to Russia a week after it invaded Ukraine last year. But a few months later, sources claimed that Russians were still using authorized parallel importation channels to buy the new iPhone 14. Russia allegedly legalised these import programs a few months into the conflict, allowing merchants to bring goods into the nation without the owner’s consent. 

It’s unknown whether all Russian government officials received the same advice to get rid of their Apple iPhones, despite reports that those within the Russian presidential administration were instructed to do so. A request for comment made prior to publication was not quickly answered by the Russian Federation’s embassy in the US. To the contrary, Dmitry Peskov, the press secretary for the Kremlin, advised reporters that “smartphones should not be used for official business,” according to Reuters. Apple is yet to respond on the issue. Read all the Latest News, Trending News, Cricket News, Bollywood News, India News and Entertainment News here.

 "" Farmers will not be able to recoup their investment made in the agriculture sector ""

To add insult to injury, the government has decided to reduce the subsidy given to the farmers on the purchase of chemical fertilisers which are widely used to increase agriculture productivity. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, a meeting of the Fertiliser Supply and Distribution Management Committee has decided to reduce the previously given subsidy of 70.82 per cent and maintain it at 59.04 per cent for the meantime.

The committee has also decided to gradually reduce the subsidy to around 50 per cent as per a statement issued by the ministry. As per the decision, urea fertilser will cost Rs 25 per kg, DPA (Di-ammonium Phosphate) fertiliser Rs 50 per kg and potash fertilser Rs 40 per kg. Before the decision, urea used to be sold at Rs 14 per kg, DAP at Rs 43 per kg and potash at Rs 31 per kg. The prices for the listed fertilisers have now increased by Rs 11, Rs 7 and Rs 9 per kg, respectively.

Earlier, the government was providing a subsidy of 80 per cent on urea, 60 per cent on DAP and 59 per cent on potash.

According to the ministry, the decision was made as per the request of the Ministry of Finance to reduce the subsidy given on the procurement of chemical fertilisers, stating that the prices of the chemical fertilisers have increased in the international market due to the ongoing war in Ukraine and disruption in their supply chain. The Finance Ministry has said the government was losing a big portion of the budget due to the high cost of imports and high subsidy given on the sale of the chemical fertilisers to the farmers. As per the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development, the country needs to import as much as 520,000 metric tons of chemical fertilisers annually. The government has allocated a budget of Rs 38.5 billion to provide subsidies on chemical fertilisers in the current fiscal. The government has decided to procure 331,500 metric tons of chemical fertilisers from India under the G2G provision.

Although the ministry has claimed that the reduced subsidy on the chemical fertilisers will help curb their black marketing, it will have a negative impact on agriculture productivity, especially on paddy, wheat and maize, which are the major cereal crops.

Nepal grows just 40 per cent of its wheat needs, and the rest is imported, mainly from India, which also imposes a ban on its export at times when it faces a shortage in the domestic market. It is the small-scale farmers who will face the brunt of the reduced subsidy.

What about the subsidy given on the LPG, or cooking gas, which is sold at Rs 1,800 per cylinder? The actual price of a LPG cylinder, as per Nepal Oil Corporation, stands at Rs 2,500. Nepali farmers will not be able to recoup their investment made in the agriculture sector, which is already under stress due to imports of cheap food and climate change. It will not encourage youths to take up farming as a profession.

There are some areas where subsidy can be curtailed, and the money thus saved from them can be channelised to give a boost to the agriculture sector.

Reducing the given subsidy on the chemical fertilisers will mean the farmers will stop growing food, and the government will have to import more food from outside by spending more from the state coffers to feed its population.

LAHORE - Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari has said that as water is important for humans in the same way trees are important for ensuring healthy environment. According to a press release issued here on Thursday, she said that it is a responsibility of every citizen to plant one sapling today to mark World Forest Day in an appropriate way. 

She said that tree plantation campaign has been started across the province as per the direction of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. 

She further said that planting one sapling today would yield positive results in future for coming generations. Azma Bukhari said, “Air Quality Index of Lahore has already increased to alarming level and planting saplings is the only cheapest way to deal with environmental pollution.” 

Meanwhile, Punjab Agriculture Minister Ashiq Hussain Kirmani said on Thursday that tree plantation campaign was inevitable to reduce environmental pollution. He said this while planting a sapling at Liberty Chowk here. He said that Punjab would be made ‘Sarsabz’ as per the vision of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. He said that during current year, 1.1 million plants would be planted under urban forestation in Lahore. 

Syed Ashiq Kirmani also distributed informative material related to different types of plants and tree plantation among the people. He said that it was essential to increase the number of trees to deal with challenges of global warming. He said that the incumbent government had started tree plantation drive to reduce environmental pollution and entire government machinery was participating in it.

EN_CC_200242.txt,CC: Criticism of climate movement,CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other,"CLAIM: Charred remains of “entire families” found huddled inside Maui homes as local morgues run out of body bags 

 As Biden issued a statement of ""no comment"" before jaunting from one beach vacation in Delaware to his next vacation in Lake Tahoe, locals in and around Lahaina are saying that the true death toll is much, much higher than Maui authorities are reporting.

The actual death toll, according to some locals, is more like 480, with many of the bodies still not recovered or identified.

""The figure is quadruple that of the official number of 111 – and some of the relatives of the victims have been left to uncover the remains of their loved ones themselves due to the glacial progress of the search and recovery operation,"" one report claims.

The shocking video footage below shows authorities in Maui loading bodies onto a refrigerated truck as an extension of local morgues which are now said to be too full to hold any more bodies:

(Related: Were the Maui fires really natural, or were they an act of climate terrorism by radical leftists pushing a deranged global warming narrative?)

The fact that Biden, also known as the ""big guy"" on Hunter's laptop, is saying nothing about Maui and showing no concern at all for the victims there is hardly a surprise, seeing as how his primary focus is on padding the pockets of Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine.

If Maui were to be renamed ""Ukraine,"" Biden would surely start pumping billions of taxpayer dollars into its coffers without. He does this without end for Zelensky while actual Americans struggle to survive amid skyrocketing inflation and a collapsing economy.

""One-hundred percent not enough is being done, so people are doing it themselves,"" said Maui local Allisen Medina.

""The government, relief organizations – they're not doing anything. We have the right to know what's going on. FEMA came here to help with the recovery [process], but we don't see them. The Red Cross arrived four days late and they're not doing anything. They're supposed to help and not just stand around.""

""We're only 100 miles from Oahu which has several military bases. Why is the response so lacking? Why are they doing so little? Why is nothing else being done?""

Medina's claims were corroborated by Southwest Airlines stewardess Sarah Trost, who says she spoke with a morgue worker in the Maui area who confirmed to her that the true death count so far is at least 480 people.

Authorities, Trost says, have only searched about 13 percent of the burnt-out area, not 78 percent like they recently falsely claimed.

""He found so many children, children and moms holding each other,"" Trost said in a video she posted to TikTok. ""Infants, toddlers, the unimaginable. Husbands and wives, whole entire [families] in a room just huddling together, burning to death.""

There are also about 1,400 people still missing, whom some believe are dead and gone in the ashes – meaning they are unidentifiable.

""It's all bones,"" Trost said. ""So, he's grabbing the bones with the ash shoveling them into body bags. They have no more room on the island in the morgue so they're shipping in containers to hold those body bags.""

In the comments, someone wrote that he suspects the true number of dead is more like 4,800, seeing as how the population of Lahaina before the fires was around 12,216 (as of 2020).

There does not appear to be anything natural about the Maui fires. Learn more at FalseFlag.news.

 Germany's ex-interior minister lashes out at government's political stance on Ukraine-Russia conflict

Otto Schily was one of the founding members of the Greens Party in 1980, but then joined the Social Democrats (SPD) nine years later. Today, the former German interior minister is sharply criticising his former parties regarding their stance on the Ukraine-Russia conflict, the management of the economy and the direction energy policy has taken.

Former German Interior Minister Otto Schily cautioned against the dangers of Germany taking an unilateral course in the Ukraine conflict, while at the same time clearly arguing in favour of war. „A bellicosity has developed in Germany, which is risky,” Mr Schily told the German Press Agency.

“The Greens, of all people, are too one-sided. There is too little thought about how we can get out of the conflict,”

said the former Social Democrat politician, emphasizing that he unreservedly condemns the war and the bloodshed it brings. He added that instead of deepening the conflict, the German federal government should be seeking to find other prospects for Ukraine besides being sent money and weapons. Constructive ideas and political imagination are needed, he said.

Mr Schily also told the press agency how he sees the tense situation that has unfolded:

„Ukraine wants to remain independent. Everyone has to acknowledge that. At the same time it must be clear that one has to live with one’s neighbours, including with Russia. Both sides have interests that must be taken into account. Russia will always remain a factor, also with regard to Europe. We have to find a way to deal with the Russians.”

Former Chancellor Gerhard Schroder’s interior minister believes that it would not be a good move for Ukraine to join NATO. He pointed out that Ukraine’s multilingualism, including the Russian language, is an indisputable fact. Taking a look at other countries shows that the interests of all sides can be safeguarded if a country remains militarily neutral. Mr Schily also sees Ukraine’s accession to the EU as unrealistic and recommends that Ukraine follow the „Swiss model”.

Switzerland is an excellent example of „how to develop a free society with mutual respect for the different ethnic backgrounds and with military neutrality. Ukraine could take Switzerland as an example,”

he said, adding that he doesn’t see “how Ukraine’s accession to the EU could work without the EU overstretching.”

Mr Schily expressly warned that the German government should not overburden the country economically. He also criticised the three-party coalition government because even amidst the energy crisis, they fail to realise how unwise it is to phase out nuclear power just because the Greens insist on it.

“Now it’s becoming even clearer that completely giving up on nuclear technology was foolish. The total abandonment of nuclear technology has placed us in a very precarious economic situation. Due to the simultaneous phase-out of nuclear power and coal, Germany has become reliant on natural gas,”

he pointed out.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West is overreacting', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other']",germany ex interior minister lash government political stance ukraine russia conflict germany ex interior minister lash government political stance ukraine russia conflict otto schily found member green party join social democrats spd year later today german interior minister sharply criticise party stance ukraine russia conflict management economy direction energy policy take german interior minister otto schily caution danger germany take unilateral course ukraine conflict time clearly argue favour war bellicosity develop germany risky mr schily tell german press agency green people side little thought conflict say social democrat politician emphasize unreservedly condemn war bloodshed bring add instead deepen conflict german federal government seek find prospect ukraine send money weapon constructive idea political imagination need say mr schily tell press agency see tense situation unfold ukraine want remain independent acknowledge time clear live neighbour include russia side interest take account russia remain factor regard europe find way deal russians chancellor gerhard schroder interior minister believe good ukraine join nato point ukraine multilingualism include russian language indisputable fact take look country show interest side safeguard country remain militarily neutral mr schily see ukraine accession eu unrealistic recommend ukraine follow swiss model switzerland excellent example develop free society mutual respect different ethnic background military neutrality ukraine switzerland example say add doesn ukraine accession eu work eu overstretching mr schily expressly warn german government overburden country economically criticise party coalition government amidst energy crisis fail realise unwise phase nuclear power green insist clear completely give nuclear technology foolish total abandonment nuclear technology place precarious economic situation simultaneous phase nuclear power coal germany reliant natural gas point

 A new report by the Climate and Health Alliance has suggested the Irish diet and food system is like a slow-motion disaster, fuelling premature death and disability due to diet-related chronic diseases.

The report calls for the ending of the junk food cycle and a switch away from processed foods to more plant-based diets.

The report said the global food system can feed the world, but it has also made people heavier and sicker.

The report also said it destroys wildlife, pollutes rivers and air, and is responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions.

The report is concerned that ultra-processed foods and excessive red and processed meat are dominating the Irish diet at the expense of fruit, vegetables, plant proteins, whole grains, and sustainable seafood.

The Alliance has called for a special Cabinet sub-committee to oversee ""a food revolution"" and for the farming industry to be a key part of the solution.

A dietitian with the Irish Heart Foundation said the ""playbook for smoking"" needs to be applied to junk food.

Speaking to RTÉ's Morning Ireland, Orna O'Brien explained this would restrict the marketing and promotion of junk foods.

She called for policy and structural changes to be implemented to encourage consumers to buy less processed food.

 Israel to respond to genocide charges at UN’s top court

Israel will respond to charges of genocide at the United Nations’ top court on Friday after South Africa filed an urgent request with the court to order a ceasefire in Gaza.

It is the third time the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has held hearings on the Israel-Hamas war since South Africa filed proceedings at The Hague court in December.

On Thursday, South Africa told the court the situation in Gaza has reached “a new and horrific stage”, and urged the 15 judges to take urgent action.

Israel must “totally and unconditionally withdraw” from the Gaza Strip, said Vusimuzi Madonsela, South Africa’s ambassador to the Netherlands.

South Africa has submitted four requests for the ICJ to investigate Israel. According to the latest request, the country says Israel’s military incursion in Rafah threatens the “very survival of Palestinians in Gaza”.

During hearings earlier this year, Israel strongly denied committing genocide in Gaza, saying it does all it can to spare civilians and is only targeting Hamas militants. Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.

In January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.

The court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.

“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.

ICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.

A 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.

Most of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.

The war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.

Gaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.

South Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.

On Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case. Several countries have also indicated they plan to intervene, but only Libya, Nicaragua and Colombia have filed formal requests to do so.

 A 'Watershed Event': Five Takeaways From Israel's Assassination Of Hamas' Political Leader In Tehran

Authored by Andrew Korybko via substack,

Hamas’ political leader Ismail Haniyeh was assassinated by Israel early Wednesday morning in the heart of the Iranian capital hours after attending President Masoud Pezeshkian’s inauguration. The details remain unclear, but it’s widely thought that he was killed by a precision drone strike at his residence. The world is watching to see whether Iran and/or its Resistance Axis allies will respond, what form it could take if so, and whether that would escalate tensions to a wider war.

Here are five takeaways thus far:

1. Israel’s Intelligence & Tactics Are Top-Notch

Israel somehow or another obtained accurate intelligence about Haniyeh’s location despite it being top-secret and was then able to successfully assassinate him. Whatever air defenses (including electronic warfare ones) that Iran had deployed in its capital as part of the security measures to protect its high-profile guests failed to thwart this attack. This is a major embarrassment for the Islamic Republic and prompts speculation about whether it was due to utter incompetence or was partially an inside job.

2. Iran Is Caught In A Dilemma Over How To Respond

It’s unimaginable that Iran won’t respond to its Israeli enemy assassinating a high-profile allied guest in Tehran during the new president’s inauguration, but the dilemma is over the form that this response will take. Launching another drone and missile salvo against Israel like it did in the spring after the bombing of its consulate in Damascus is possible, though Israel could spin that as a failure if many of them are shot down like last time, the on-the-ground damage is minimal, and no high-profile targets are killed.

3. Mutually Assured Destruction Hangs Heavy Over Everyone’s Head

The response that Iran resorts to will be determined by its leadership’s understanding of how far they can go without triggering the “mutually assured destruction” (MAD) scenario, which both Israel and the Resistance Axis fear and is why they’ve thus far restrained themselves from waging all-out war. A repeat of spring’s salvo could remain below that threshold, but Iran might also respond in a different way that’s interpreted by Israel as an escalation, thus prompting its own escalation that could then lead to MAD.

4. A Choreographed Response Might Therefore Be The Most “Rational”…

Duma member Dmitry Belik, whose claim to fame was helping Sevastopol reunify with Russia when he briefly served as the region’s acting head in spring 2014, described spring’s salvo as a “beautiful theatrical production”. If there’s any truth to his innuendo that Iran choreographed its response with the US and/or Israel to Israel’s bombing of its consulate in Syria, then it might also do the same after Haniyeh’s assassination, which could help Iran “save face” while averting an escalation towards MAD.

5. …But There’s No Guarantee That Iran’s Allies Will “Stand Down”

Hamas and Hezbollah are Iran’s allies but operate independently of it despite their close ties. There’s accordingly no guarantee that they’ll “stand down” and not respond in their own way if Iran sends another salvo to Israel regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed. After all, Hamas’ political chief was just killed, while one of Hezbollah’s top commanders was assassinated by Israel in Beirut the day prior. This makes the MAD risk even less manageable since those two might not share Iran’s calculations.

Haniyeh’s assassination is a watershed event in the latest Israeli-Hamas War, which is now a regional Israeli-Iranian proxy war, since it greatly spikes the risk of everything spiraling into MAD.

Iran’s response will be crucial in determining whether or not that happens, but so too will Hamas and Hezbollah’s.

They’ll either “stand down” as Iran responds regardless of whether or not it’s choreographed, participate in a joint response that remains below the MAD threshold, or decide to cross that red line on their own.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],watershed event takeaway israel assassination hamas political leader tehran watershed event takeaway israel assassination hamas political leader tehran author andrew korybko substack hamas political leader ismail haniyeh assassinate israel early wednesday morning heart iranian capital hour attend president masoud pezeshkian inauguration detail remain unclear widely think kill precision drone strike residence world watch iran and/or resistance axis ally respond form escalate tension wide war takeaway far israel intelligence tactic notch israel obtain accurate intelligence haniyeh location despite secret able successfully assassinate air defense include electronic warfare one iran deploy capital security measure protect high profile guest fail thwart attack major embarrassment islamic republic prompt speculation utter incompetence partially inside job iran catch dilemma respond unimaginable iran win respond israeli enemy assassinate high profile ally guest tehran new president inauguration dilemma form response launch drone missile salvo israel like spring bombing consulate damascus possible israel spin failure shoot like time ground damage minimal high profile target kill mutually assure destruction hang heavy head response iran resort determine leadership understanding far trigger mutually assure destruction mad scenario israel resistance axis fear ve far restrain wage war repeat spring salvo remain threshold iran respond different way interpret israel escalation prompt escalation lead mad choreographed response rational duma member dmitry belik claim fame help sevastopol reunify russia briefly serve region act head spring describe spring salvo beautiful theatrical production truth innuendo iran choreograph response and/or israel israel bombing consulate syria haniyeh assassination help iran save face avert escalation mad guarantee iran ally stand hamas hezbollah iran ally operate independently despite close tie accordingly guarantee ll stand respond way iran send salvo israel regardless choreograph hamas political chief kill hezbollah commander assassinate israel beirut day prior make mad risk manageable share iran calculation haniyeh assassination watershed event late israeli hamas war regional israeli iranian proxy war greatly spike risk spiral mad iran response crucial determine happen hamas hezbollah s. ll stand iran respond regardless choreographed participate joint response remain mad threshold decide cross red line

Chief Guterres Decries ‘Climate-Related Carnage’ from ‘Apocalyptic Flooding’ 

 The United Nations alarmist-in-chief António Guterres has denounced “climate-related carnage” in Pakistan caused by “apocalyptic flooding.”

Apparently unable to sympathize with those in need without invoking the bogeyman of global warming, Guterres took advantage of Pakistan’s flooding plight to advance his crusade against the “climate crisis.”

“I will never forget the climate-related carnage I saw after apocalyptic flooding submerged a third of Pakistan,” the U.N. chief declared Wednesday on Twitter (now X). “I call on donors & international financial institutions to make good on their funding pledges in support of recovery efforts as soon as possible.”

In a separate Tweet Wednesday, the veteran Portuguese socialist asserted that the “climate emergency is threatening the very survival of communities & economies that depend on tourism,” before touting “green investments” as well as “investing in sustainable tourism.”

According to the U.N. Secretary-General, those working for real Climate Action are “on the right side of history” since the battle to stop global warming constitutes the “fight of our lives.”

Guterres’ bombast has been heating up much faster than the environment.

Just this month, Guterres said that humanity must urgently find solutions to climate change because it “has opened the gates of hell.”

“Horrendous heat is having horrendous effects,” Guterres warned in his opening remarks at the U.N. Climate Ambition Summit in New York. “Distraught farmers watching crops carried away by floods; sweltering temperatures spawning disease; and thousands fleeing in fear as historic fires rage.”

This summer, he said that “the era of global warming has ended, the era of global boiling has arrived” (emphasis added).

He also claimed that the “dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,” adding that the “climate breakdown has begun.”

Guterres has placed the blame for the climate crisis on “our fossil fuel addiction,” insisting that “climate is imploding faster than we can cope.”

While wild hyperbole and theatrical rhetoric may work in advertising, one cannot help but wonder whether they do not diminish the seriousness of Mr. Guterres’ case and indeed of his office.

 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sept. 21 accused Western powers of engaging in nuclear blackmail and put his country onto an enhanced wartime footing, ordering a partial military mobilization and vowing to use “all means available” in the event of a threat against Russia and its people.

“Those that allow such statements shall be reminded that our country also has various weapons of mass destruction,” including some that are more advanced than those in NATO’s arsenal, he added, according to a translation of his remarks by Sky News.

Accusations Against the WestPutin accused the West of seeking to “weaken, divide and ultimately destroy” Russia, according to an official Kremlin translation of part of his speech, which was posted on the Kremlin website.

Claiming that Western powers had concocted these plans long ago, Putin said they fomented anti-Russia terrorist activity in the Caucasus, moved “NATO’s offensive infrastructure” near his country’s borders, nurtured “hatred for Russia for decades,” and intended to set up Ukraine as an “anti-Russia bridgehead.”

Russia’s Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu told Russian state television that Putin’s mobilization order would encompass reservists but wouldn’t include students or anyone without prior military service.

The Russian leadership has been reluctant to order a broad military mobilization, portraying the invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” that’s limited in scope.

Putin’s order marks the first time since World War Two that a military mobilization of Russian citizens has been invoked.

Critical ReactionsPutin’s move drew critical reactions from Western leaders and Ukrainian officials.

Bridget Brink, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, took to Twitter to describe Putin’s order as a sign of “weakness” and “failure.”

Britain’s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace was cited by The Scotsman as saying that Putin’s order amounts to an admission of failure.

“Putin’s breaking of his own promises not to mobilize parts of his population and the illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine, are an admission that his invasion is failing,” Wallace said.

“No amount of threats and propaganda can hide the fact that Ukraine is winning the war, the international community are united, and Russia is becoming a pariah,” he added.

 Treason trial opens for L.A. woman held in Russia for donating $50 to Ukraine charity

MOSCOW — The trial of a Russian American dual citizen whom Russia accuses of treason opened Thursday as tensions rise between Washington and Moscow, including over the arrests of two American journalists.

The trial is being held behind closed doors in Yekaterinburg, in the same court that next week is to begin hearing the case of Evan Gershkovich, a Wall Street Journal reporter who was arrested in March 2023 and charged with espionage.

The defendant was identified by Russian authorities as Los Angeles resident Ksenia Karelina, although U.S. media reports frequently use the surname Khavana, the name of her ex-husband.

A Russian American woman from Los Angeles is held in Russia on treason charges, apparently over a donation to a charity for Ukraine.

Karelina was born in Yekaterinburg and was arrested in February while visiting her family.

Russia’s main domestic security agency, the Federal Security Service, charges that Karelina raised money for a Ukrainian organization that was providing weapons, ammunition and other supplies to the Ukrainian military. Her boyfriend has said she made a single donation of about $50 to a Ukrainian organization, according to media reports.

Karelina faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Almost all Russian criminal cases that make it to court end in convictions. The trial was adjourned in the afternoon and the next session was set for Aug. 7, Russian news agencies said.

Gershkovich, the highest-profile American behind bars in Russia, is accused of gathering secret information from a tank factory in Nizhny Tagil, about 90 miles north of Yekaterinburg.

His employers deny the allegation, and the U.S. State Department has declared him to be wrongfully detained.

Ksenia Karelina, a U.S.-Russia dual citizen who was detained in Russia over an apparent donation to a Ukrainian aid group, appeared via video in court on Thursday. A judge denied her appeal.

Gershkovich’s trial, also closed, is to begin Wednesday.

A journalist for U.S.-funded Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe with U.S. and Russian dual citizenship has been held since October on charges of gathering military information and failing to register as a foreign agent.

Since sending troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has sharply cracked down on dissent and has passed laws that criminalize criticism of the operation in Ukraine and remarks considered to discredit the Russian military. Concern has risen since then that Russia could be targeting U.S. nationals for arrest.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],treason trial l.a woman hold russia donate ukraine charity open treason trial open l.a woman hold russia donate ukraine charity moscow trial russian american dual citizen russia accuse treason open thursday tension rise washington moscow include arrest american journalist trial hold close door yekaterinburg court week begin hear case evan gershkovich wall street journal reporter arrest march charge espionage defendant identify russian authority los angeles resident ksenia karelina u.s medium report frequently use surname khavana ex husband russian american woman los angeles hold russia treason charge apparently donation charity ukraine karelina bear yekaterinburg arrest february visit family russia main domestic security agency federal security service charge karelina raise money ukrainian organization provide weapon ammunition supply ukrainian military boyfriend say single donation ukrainian organization accord medium report karelina face sentence year prison convict russian criminal case court end conviction trial adjourn afternoon session set aug russian news agency say gershkovich high profile american bar russia accuse gather secret information tank factory nizhny tagil mile north yekaterinburg employer deny allegation u.s state department declare wrongfully detain ksenia karelina u.s.-russia dual citizen detain russia apparent donation ukrainian aid group appear video court thursday judge deny appeal gershkovich trial close begin wednesday journalist u.s.-funded radio liberty radio free europe u.s russian dual citizenship hold october charge gather military information fail register foreign agent send troop ukraine february russia sharply crack dissent pass law criminalize criticism operation ukraine remark consider discredit russian military concern rise russia target u.s national arrest

 The former head of German intelligence has revealed that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and President of Poland both collaborated to carry out the attack on the Nord Stream Pipelines.

The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines were sabotaged on 26 September 2022 after a series of underwater explosions and gas leaks.

Modernity.news reports: Much of the legacy media initially blamed Russia for attack, claiming it was a false flag but offering no sensible reason as to why Moscow would target its own energy infrastructure.

However, during an appearance on German broadcaster WELT-TV, August Hanning, who served as the head of Germany’s Federal Intelligence Service (BND) from 1998 to 2005, the attack was carried out at the behest of Zelensky and Andrzej Duda.

According to Hanning, the act of sabotage occurred as a result of an “agreement between the highest officials in Ukraine and Poland.”

“There were agreements between Zelensky and Duda to carry out the attack,” said Hanning.

As we highlighted yesterday, Germany issued an arrest warrant for a Ukrainian diver believed to be involved in the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines, but Polish authorities failed to stop him at the border and he is now believed to be back in Ukraine.

Berlin issued a European arrest warrant for Ukrainian citizen Volodymyr Z. after identifying him as the chief suspect for placing the explosives that destroyed the pipelines, but Polish authorities claimed they didn’t apprehend the suspect as a result of Berlin not including his name in a database of wanted persons.

The pipeline attack was preceded by warnings from the White House that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would spell the end for Nord Stream 2.

On January 27, 2022, Under-Secretary of State Victoria Nuland stated, “If Russia invades Ukraine, one way or another, Nord Stream 2 will not move forward.”

On February 7, 2022, President Biden said, “If Russia invades… again, then there will be no longer a Nord Stream 2.”

In February 2023, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour Hersh published a report asserting that the pipelines were destroyed by the US as part of a covert operation.

According to Hersh’s sources, the explosives were planted in June 2022 by US Navy divers under the guise of the BALTOPS 22 NATO exercise and were detonated three months later with a remote signal sent by a sonar buoy.

It remains to be seen conclusively who ordered and carried out the attack, but the argument that Russia was behind it is looking increasingly tenuous.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Distrust towards Media']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Distrust towards Media: Western media is an instrument of propaganda']",head german intelligence reveal zelensky nord stream pipeline attack head german intelligence reveal ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky president poland collaborate carry attack nord stream pipeline nord stream pipeline sabotage september series underwater explosion gas leak bypass censor sign unfiltered news deliver straight inbox unsubscribe time subscribe agree term use late video modernity.new report legacy medium initially blame russia attack claim false flag offer sensible reason moscow target energy infrastructure appearance german broadcaster welt tv august hanning serve head germany federal intelligence service bnd attack carry behest zelensky andrzej duda accord hanning act sabotage occur result agreement high official ukraine poland agreement zelensky duda carry attack say hanning highlight yesterday germany issue arrest warrant ukrainian diver believe involve attack nord stream pipeline polish authority fail stop border believe ukraine berlin issue european arrest warrant ukrainian citizen volodymyr z. identify chief suspect place explosive destroy pipeline polish authority claim didn apprehend suspect result berlin include database want person pipeline attack precede warning white house russian invasion ukraine spell end nord stream january secretary state victoria nuland state russia invade ukraine way nord stream forward february president biden say russia invade long nord stream february pulitzer prize win journalist seymour hersh publish report assert pipeline destroy covert operation accord hersh source explosive plant june navy diver guise baltop nato exercise detonate month later remote signal send sonar buoy remain see conclusively order carry attack argument russia look increasingly tenuous

 Climate change protesters have been arrested in Melbourne, Victoria after they staged another blockade, this time at the busy Flinders Street Station.

Over 30 climate activists refused to move off the road at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets on March 16. This followed a protest of hundreds of activists who marched from Treasury Gardens to Flinders Street Station in the city later in the afternoon.

The activists were heard yelling, “People power, power to the people,” and, “This is civil disobedience in action.”

“Doing it for the kids I love,” and, “Climate crisis,” were among the signs and banners waved by the group of protesters.

“Free Palestine” signs were also seen among the climate emergency signs displayed on Melbourne streets.

Meanwhile, police arrested 32 people who remained on the runway, and 27 of them will be charged on summons with obstruction of the road.

Police had warned rally organisers who wanted to avoid arrest to leave the intersection, The Age reported.

A spokesperson for Victorian Police told The Epoch Times they attended the planned rally and say about 300 people were there.

“A number of protesters remained at the intersection of Flinders and Swanston Streets after being told to move on by police,” the police said. “32 protesters remained on the roadway and were subsequently arrested. 27 of those protesters will be charged on summons with obstruction of a road.

“Five of those protesters needed to be carried from the roadway by police, four will be charged with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker, and summary hinder police, and bailed to Melbourne Magistrates Court. One will be charged on summons with intentional obstruction of an emergency worker and summary hinder police.”

Extinction Rebellion Victoria posted multiple videos showing footage of the event on March 17.

Multiple Protests Throughout the WeekDuring the week, Extinction Rebellion held multiple “disrupt the city” protests in the city.

“We rebel on the unceded lands of the peoples of the Kulin Nation. Always was, always will be,” the group claimed.

Police were forced to move activists to the footpath on March 13 after they allegedly blocked traffic on LaTrobe and Bourke Streets.

“We are non-violent protesters—we would never resort to violence because we creating the world that we want to see.”

However, the Victorian Police said they respect the right to peacefully protest.

Incident Follows Perth Climate ProtestIn late February, a climate change activist was arrested, and multiple others were issued move-on notices, at a protest against a major Woodside gas project.

The activists were seen holding signs including “oil and gas collapse,” “climate action now,” and “Woodside ecocide blood on your hands,” gathered outside the company’s headquarters in Perth.

Police were seen placing handcuffs on an individual on the road in front of the company’s building on Feb. 20.

This rally was timed to coincide with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese travelling to Perth for three days to discuss the economy, cost of living, and housing at a Federal Cabinet meeting.

Commenting on the incident, a police spokesperson confirmed with The Epoch Times that one person had been charged with obstructing the carriageway.

EN_CC_200044.txt,CC: Criticism of climate movement,CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other,"British Police Given New Powers to Crack Down on Disruptive Protests 

 LONDON (AP) – New and expanded powers for British police took effect on Sunday, including measures targeting activists who stop traffic and major building works with protests.

Authorities have repeatedly condemned environmental protest groups, including Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion, which have sought to raise awareness about the urgency of climate change by staging multiple high-profile protests at the busiest highways and roads. Their protests in recent years often caused serious disruption for motorists.

From Sunday, police will have powers to move static protests. Critics have argued the toughened laws are a threat to the right to protest, but U.K. officials say the measures were to stop “disruption from a selfish minority.”

“The public have had enough of their lives being disrupted by selfish protesters. The mayhem we’ve seen on our streets has been a scandal,” Home Secretary Suella Braverman said.

Authorities say that under the new Public Order Act, protesters found guilty of “tunnelling” – or digging underground tunnels to obstruct the building of new infrastructure works – could face three years in prison. Anyone found guilty of obstructing a major transportation project could be jailed for up to six months.

The law also makes “locking on,” or protesters attaching themselves to other people, objects or buildings, a criminal offense.

Hundreds of climate change protesters were arrested last year in the U.K. for blocking major roads and bridges. Many activists protested by sitting in the middle of the roads or gluing themselves to the roadway to make them harder to move.

The civil disobedience is a wave of direct action that has also seen activists glue themselves to famous museum paintings or throw soup at artworks to draw media attention to their cause.

Police have said it’s costly to deal with the protests and that they diverted thousands of officers from other work like dealing with crime.

Despite peace talks on the Belarusian border, the Ukraine war rages on with no hint of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will withdraw his troops.

Russia has military control over much of Ukraine's southern regions but is fighting to take control of Mariupol.

The city is surrounded by Russian forces but Ukraine refuses to surrender.

Ukrainian forces are holding on to important cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv as well as Odesa, which is a crucial connection to supplies.

Capital Kyiv remains under Ukrainian control with the nearest Russian troops about 15 miles from the city centre.

Troops attacked the Retroville mall just outside Kyiv in the Podilskyi district, killing eight civilians.

In the north of the country, Russian troops are attempting to surround the city of Sumy.

Many civilians have joined Ukrainian forces in the fight for their homeland.

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

 by Mac Slavo, SHTF Plan:

Russia is preparing for a war with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) and the West. The preparations are for a “long-term confrontation”.

A growing number of Western rulers have also warned of a military threat from Russia to countries along the eastern flank of NATO, calling for Europe to get prepared by rearming.

The chief of the intelligence service said the assessment was based on Russian plans to double the number of forces stationed along its border with NATO members Finland and the Baltic States of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia. “Russia has chosen a path which is a long-term confrontation … and the Kremlin is probably anticipating a possible conflict with NATO within the next decade or so,” Kaupo Rosin told reporters at the release of Estonia’s national security threats report, according to a report by The New York Post.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Rosin claimed that a military attack by Russia is “highly unlikely” in the short term, partly because Russia has to keep troops in Ukraine, and that would be unlikely if the Russian buildup of forces was matched in Europe. “If we are not prepared, the likelihood (of a military Russian attack) would be much higher than without any preparation,” Rosin added.

Estonia and the other Baltic States have increased their military spending to over 2% of the value of their economies after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, and NATO allies have raised their presence in those countries.

Germany plans to have 4,800 combat-ready troops in the region by 2027, in its first permanent foreign deployment since World War Two, and Rosin said NATO and its allies were moving in the right direction to counter the Russian threat. –The New York Post.

Russia has repeatedly warned that it will go to war with NATO if the West’s weapons defeat Russia, or lethal aid is sent to Ukraine. One could argue that the West has crossed that line, but Russia has yet to follow through with an attack on NATO.

Russia Warns NATO A Nuclear War Will Ensue If Western Weapons Defeat Russia

 The Moscow stock exchange announced on Wednesday that it will stop trading in dollars and euros.

The announcement came on the same day that the United States introduced a new package of sanctions against Russia and came into effect from Thursday, June 13.

The Moscow Exchange on Thursday suspended trading in dollars and euros after it was sanctioned by the United States in a new raft of restrictions aimed at hindering Russia’s ability to wage war in Ukraine.

“Due to the introduction of restrictive measures by the United States against the Moscow Exchange Group… from June 13, 2024, trading on the Moscow Exchange markets will be conducted… with the exception of instruments with settlements in U.S. dollars and euros,” the exchange said in a statement.

“In the face of new challenges, the Moscow Exchange will continue to provide clients with access to all segments of the trading platform,” it added.

Later Thursday, the Russian Central Bank said it would suspend morning trading on the Moscow Exchange’s foreign exchange, precious metals and derivatives markets from Friday until further notice.

Russia’s National Clearing Center, which acts as an intermediary in foreign exchange transactions at the Moscow Exchange, was also hit by U.S. sanctions.

The U.S. Treasury Department on Wednesday widened sanctions against Russia aimed at cutting the flow of money and goods to Moscow as it continues to wage war on neighboring Ukraine. The sanctions targeted more than 300 entities, including those in Russia and countries like China, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

 ISLAMABAD, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Friday that his country will learn from China's experience to eradicate poverty and enhance exports to increase foreign exchange reserves, the Prime Minister's Office said.

In a meeting held in his office, Sharif said that China's success in lifting more than 700 million people out of poverty serves as a role model for Pakistan, the office said in a statement.

He added that Pakistan wants to benefit from China's experiences in increasing exports which will act as a major step to increase foreign exchange reserves and decrease poverty.

""Pakistan and China share longstanding and deep brotherly relations which are strengthening over time,"" he said, adding that China has always helped Pakistan in difficult times, for which he, along with the entire nation, is grateful to the Chinese leadership and people.

The prime minister encouraged Chinese companies to set up industries in Special Economic Zones being established under the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Launched in 2013, CPEC, a flagship project of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, is a corridor linking Gwadar Port in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan province with Kashgar in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which highlights energy, transport and industrial cooperation.

The prime minister said thorough preparations are being made for CPEC's new phase and its successful initiation will further strengthen economic relations between Pakistan and China.

The prime minister emphasized that Pakistan, being an agricultural country, is committed to adopting the modern techniques and technology of China in agriculture to increase productivity.

He also invited Chinese companies to set up plants for electric and hybrid vehicles in Pakistan to help the country achieve the goal of shifting to electric vehicles in the transportation sector to mitigate the impacts of climate change. ■",EN,['Other'],['Other'],pakistan follow china example enhance export pm islamabad xinhua pakistani prime minister shehbaz sharif say friday country learn china experience eradicate poverty enhance export increase foreign exchange reserve prime minister office say meeting hold office sharif say china success lift million people poverty serve role model pakistan office say statement add pakistan want benefit china experience increase export act major step increase foreign exchange reserve decrease poverty pakistan china share longstanding deep brotherly relation strengthen time say add china help pakistan difficult time entire nation grateful chinese leadership people prime minister encourage chinese company set industry special economic zone establish framework china pakistan economic corridor cpec launch cpec flagship project china propose belt road initiative corridor link gwadar port southwest pakistan balochistan province kashgar northwest china xinjiang uygur autonomous region highlight energy transport industrial cooperation prime minister say thorough preparation cpec new phase successful initiation strengthen economic relation pakistan china prime minister emphasize pakistan agricultural country commit adopt modern technique technology china agriculture increase productivity invite chinese company set plant electric hybrid vehicle pakistan help country achieve goal shift electric vehicle transportation sector mitigate impact climate change
EN_UA_300074.txt,URW: Amplifying war-related fears,URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other,"UN Chief Warns of Global Economic Crisis at World Economic Forum in Davos 

 United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a grim outlook on the global economic during the World Economic Forum’s 2023 summit in Davos, Switzerland, warning of a possible worldwide economic downturn.

Citing the “perfect storm” of the Russia–Ukraine war, high food prices, and high energy costs, Guterres said that there will be “huge economic consequences” around the world. He did not predict, however, when the slowdown would start.

Guterres noted that economies outside the United States, Europe, and Asia would face worsening economic conditions. Developing countries in Africa, South America, and much of Asia are seeing rising interest rates, he noted.

“Interest rates are going up extremely in the global south. Countries are close to default. They have no resources because they couldn’t print money like the United States did, like Europe did during the COVID-19 [pandemic],” the UN chief told Bartiromo. “They have no access to concessional funding because many of them are middle-income countries. Look at small island developing states, the Caribbean islands.”

Some of those countries, he added, “lived on tourism” and “tourism has ended for two years, but as they are middle-income countries, they had no debt to live, they had no concessional funding.”

Guterres said that the United Nations is proposing a global stimulus plan to address economic woes, and claimed that economies should transition from oil and gas to other energy sources. “We need to do that in a just way,” he said, adding that “this transition needs to be well-managed.”

Meanwhile, the West and China need to have “serious” negotiations amid the dim global economic outlook, said the UN chief.

Other WarningsWhile inflation has eased at the consumer and producer level in the United States in recent months, a number of economists and business leaders say that Americans should prepare for a recession starting in 2023. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to their highest levels in decades in order to cool high inflation that reached more than 9 percent in June 2022, though it has since dropped to below 7 percent.

“Some economists argue that the strength of the labor market—as well as household balance sheets—will keep the economy strong enough to avoid a recession,” wrote Lakshman Achuthan and Anirvan Banerji, co-founders of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, for CNN’s website. “We disagree,” they wrote, saying that “it remains our expectation that the U.S. economy will enter a recession this year.”

“I’m confident that Microsoft will emerge from this stronger and more competitive,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella told employees in a memo on company’s website on Wednesday.

The annual get-together, which starts on Wednesday, comes as conflict rages in the Middle East and Ukraine and as tensions ratchet up in disputed waters in the South China Sea, where China is being accused of aggression against the Philippines, which has US backing and seeks to boost its military ties with Japan.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) chair Indonesia has yet to confirm attendees, but among them is US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who will meet ASEAN counterparts on Wednesday.

The talks will expand on Thursday to include Russia, China, Japan, South Korea, India, New Zealand and Australia.

ASEAN, a region of about 660 million people with a combined gross domestic product of more than $3.2 trillion, has for years been courted by Washington and Beijing, but their fierce rivalry has caused its members concern.

""Competition is good. But competition should not deteriorate into a zero-sum game,"" Defence Minister and presidential candidate Prabowo Subianto told a foreign policy forum this week, where he stressed the importance of non-alignment.

Relations between China and the United States have been frosty after President Joe Biden ordered the shooting down in February of a suspected Chinese spy balloon.

It was unclear who will represent China at the Jakarta meeting after the removal of its defence minister in October, raising questions about the stability of the leadership around President Xi Jinping.

Austin comes to Indonesia from South Korea, where he reiterated concerns about Russia and China helping North Korea to evade sanctions and Moscow's closer military ties with Pyongyang.

Washington has accused North Korea of supplying military equipment to Russia for use in its war with Ukraine, and Moscow of providing technical military support to help the North.

Aaron Connelly, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore, said conflict in Gaza and Ukraine and China's moves to block Philippine resupply missions at a disputed reef will most likely feature at the meeting.

""This forum is not one where major geopolitical developments are really addressed or moved forward in any significant way. But we do expect discussions from the US and Philippines on topics like the Second Thomas Shoal, Israel-Hamas, Ukraine,"" Connelly said.

 UK weather maps: Met Office issues yellow warnings over 70mph winds

The fierce winds are accompanied by a surprising change in temperature.

Met Office forecasts strong winds for the north

Crushing waves will slam the UK’s shores while power cuts and travel delays are likely as 70mph batter the country.

The Met Office has placed a yellow weather warning for wind as strong gales are predicted for much of the northeast of the UK. The weather warning covers Highlands & Eilean Siar and Orkney & Shetland in Scotland.

However, some experts predict heavy winds will also hit other coastlines along the UK. The “spell of very windy weather” is likely to lead to “travel disruption”, the weather agency said.

This includes impacting coastal routes and sea fronts with large waves, as well as possible loss of power and other services.

Delays to road, air and ferry transport are also “likely”.

While the worst of the winds will hit along the coast, speeds could still reach a substantial 60mph inland.

The weather warning is in place until 11am, although winds will remain throughout the day for much of the country.

The weather agency said: “Winds will increase quickly towards dawn Saturday across the Northern Isles with gusts generally reaching 50-60mph but with a smaller chance of 70mph gusts. Winds will quickly ease from late morning.”

The winds will accompany slightly warmer temperatures than in recent days. The mercury is likely to reach 13C in Belfast and 12C in Glasgow, both typically in the colder regions of the UK.

However the country is still reeling from the impact of Storm Isha and Storm Jocelyn.

With the ground saturated in various regions, the flood risk remains high.

Nine flood warnings were last night in place across England alone, including an alert for River Ouse in York city centre. The river burst its banks this week.

The closely consecutive storms has been attributed to the recent positions of jetstreams influencing low-pressure systems from the Atlantic. However, weather experts have also explained to Express.co.uk that climate change is likely having an impact on the number and severity of storms.

Today:

Outbreaks of rain slowly sinking south across northern Scotland, and slowing over the mainland. Elsewhere, dry with sunny spells, although cloudier later in the west with patchy drizzle. Very strong winds in the north, but lighter in the south. Mild.

Tonight:

Rain slowly returns north through the evening. Cloudy with drizzle in the north and west, but drier elsewhere with clear spells. Windy, with gales in the north. Mild for most.

 Letters to the Editor: Putin’s soldiers are raping Ukrainians. That was sadly predictable

To the editor: We’re supposed to think there’s such a thing as a “civil” incursion into another country, especially when it’s Russia attacking another former Soviet Union neighbor? (“Russia’s ‘most hidden crime’ in Ukraine war: Rape of women, girls, men and boys,” Aug. 21)

Rape is synonymous with war and always has been.

Consider the reality: Hordes of men run rampant across the landscape, destroying everything in their path. Russian President Vladimir Putin knew this would be one of the results, especially as men put in these positions consider women as meaningless objects, to be used, abused and discarded as nothing more than trash.

When the dust finally settles, and these violent sexual criminals are facing justice in the world court, I truly hope the sentence fits the crime.

Reading some of the stories of women who’ve managed to survive the assaults to mind and body makes me realize there is no civility and never will be until these crimes are erased from the books — and we all know that’ll never happen, because this is another example of full-circle history.

Kathryn Louyse, Glendale

..

To the editor: It was very difficult reading your article about Russian forces raping Ukrainian civilians. There are many crimes in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but not many as brutal and personal as rape.

The war will end someday, but the agony of being overtaken and sexually assaulted will never end for the victims who survived or their loved ones. They will carry the scars, both mental and physical, for the rest of their lives.

 How Putin has amassed a staggering SIX THOUSAND nuclear weapons that could reach UK in 20 minutes

AS sabre rattling goes, it takes some beating.

Vladimir Putin’s thinly-veiled threat to nuke the West and insistence that he is ""not bluffing"" has caused panic across the world.

Since the Cold War started, it has been assumed the threat of “mutually assured destruction” — in which tit-for-tat strikes would destroy both parties — would prevent a nuclear war.

However, in a chilling threat this week, the unhinged Russian leader declared: ""When the territorial integrity of our country is threatened, we will use all the means at our disposal to defend Russia and our people, this is not a bluff.""

With the dictator’s invasion of Ukraine meeting far stiffer resistance than expected and Western governments uniting against it, such desperate — and terrifying — measures appear more likely.

When Putin announced his invasion, he warned the West that it would face “consequences never encountered in your history” if Nato was to interfere militarily.

So, could the nightmare come true? Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.

At his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.

They include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.

They have never been used in combat — so far.

Russia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.

They include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.

Unleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.

But he may not care about retaliation.

The Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.

He said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.

“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”

This, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.

Sam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.

“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”

Nato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.

Pavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”

And US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.

'CONCERNING'

Many wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.

But one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”

However, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.

It is kind of like watching a really bad Hollywood disaster movie slowly play out, except in this case billions of people could end up dead. Thanks to the endless bumbling of the Biden administration, Russia and China have been pushed into each other’s arms, and now they seem determined to confront the western powers together. For those of you that have not been paying attention, the apocalyptic alliances that we have been anticipating for years have now formed. It is going to be the U.S. and Europe on one side, and Russia and China will be on the other. All of the marbles are at stake, and both sides have plenty of nuclear weapons.

On Tuesday, China’s top diplomat Wang Yi publicly declared that his nation is “ready to join forces with the Russian side”…

The People’s Republic of China is ready to join forces with Russia to decisively stand up for national interests and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China’s Central Committee, said on Tuesday as he met with Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolay Patrushev.

“During a virtual meeting at the end of last year our leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin – TASS) came up with a plan for further development of bilateral relations. We are ready to join forces with the Russian side, in accordance with the high-level agreements, to decisively stand up for national interests and virtues, and promote mutually beneficial cooperation in all areas,” he said.

And the Wall Street Journal is reporting that plans are being made for Chinese leader Xi Jinping to travel to Moscow for a high level summit with Vladimir Putin…

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is preparing to visit Moscow for a summit with Russia’s president in the coming months, according to people familiar with the plan, as Vladimir Putin wages war in Ukraine and portrays himself as a standard-bearer against a U.S.-led global order.

Meanwhile, the Chinese are using increasingly harsh words to describe U.S. involvement in the war in Ukraine…

And the Chinese are now calling for the UN to investigate the destruction of the Nord Stream pipelines…

China has called on the United Nations to investigate the explosions on the Nord Stream gas pipelines, describing the blasts as a “deliberate act” by state actors.

At a UN Security Council briefing on Tuesday, Chinese ambassador Zhang Jun said China shared the position of many countries in calling for an investigation “to uncover the truth and identify those responsible”.

So why would China request such an investigation?

Because they know that we did it.

And we know that they know that we did it.

And they know that we know that they know that we did it.

 Entitled ""The Climate Movement Needs to Embrace Property Destruction,"" the article chastises climate activists for not doing enough to ""reign [sic] in the fossil fuel industry.""

Citing Lund University professor and eco-terrorism proponent Andreas Malm, the article attempts to make the case that destroying public and private property is a powerful way to save the planet from global warming.

""The task for the climate movement is to make clear for people that building new pipelines, new gas terminals, opening new oil fields are acts of violence that need to be stopped – they kill people,"" Malm is quoted as saying on Bloomberg's ""Green Zero"" podcast.

""We shouldn't engage in assassinations or terrorism, or use arms and things like that. But until that line or boundary, we need virtually everything ... all the way up to sabotage and property destruction."" (Related: The New York Times similarly promoted ""sabotage"" as the ""most effective"" way to prevent environmental ""breakdown"".)

Climate terrorism is already spreading like wildfire across Europe. In Marseilles, for instance, climate terrorists destroyed a cement factory because they believed it was releasing too much carbon dioxide and warming the planet. In London, climate terrorists threw tomato soup at a Van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" painting as part of a ""Just Stop Oil"" protest.

There are not too many of them to begin with across the pond, but SUVs throughout Western Europe are turning up with flat tires as climate terrorists protest other people's use of larger vehicles, which they see as ""gas-guzzlers.""

These types of things please Malm, but he craves more destruction. According to him, this is only the beginning of what climate terrorists should be doing every day to stop all use of the earth's natural energy, i.e., natural gas and oil.

The good news is that many governments are increasing the penalties and punishments for climate terrorism. Just Stop Oil activist Jan Goodey was recently sentenced to six months in prison for disrupting a major London motorway, while a few months earlier a climate terrorist named Deanna ""Violet"" Coco received a 15-month prison sentence for blocking a lane of traffic on the Sydney Harbour Bridge for 28 minutes.

""That's what always happens when you escalate,"" Malm said smugly on the Bloomberg broadcast. ""As soon as you pose a danger to the system, this is what you'll get in return. And that's a sign that you're doing something good, that you are actually challenging some interests.""

In the comments, one reader wrote that he would like to see the punishments for climate terrorism become even more severe.

""Sentence them to 25 years minimum of extreme hard labor, or make them food for hungry animals,"" this person wrote. ""No animal should ever have to go hungry,"" he added jokingly.

Another wrote that true ecological activists who simply oppose needless environmental destruction have had their movements hijacked by communists who are running huge propaganda efforts to keep We the People fighting among ourselves as opposed to joining forces against these communists and their violent plans for the world.

""They are masters of destruction and of propaganda that dupes the masses into fighting among themselves instead of uniting to solve problems for everyone's benefit,"" this person wrote.

 BRITISH GOVERNMENT’S NOVICHOK INQUIRY REVEALS THAT ITS NOVICHOK CASE OFFICERS ARE ALSO THE GOVERNMENT’S UKRAINE WARFIGHTERS

By John Helmer, Moscow

@bears_with

The British Government has admitted over the weekend that its troops currently running the British war in the Ukraine are also engaged in managing the document file for the alleged Novichok attack against Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March 2018.

The disclosure appears in the text of a document signed by Cathryn McGahey KC, dated October 31, and released on the website of the

Dawn Sturgess Inquiry chaired by Lord Anthony Hughes (lead image left). “The war in Ukraine has required”, McGahey (right), a barrister representing the government ministries, wrote to Hughes, “and continues to require work to be undertaken by many of the same individuals and resources who are working on disclosures. Many of those working disclosure are subject matter experts,. While disclosure to the Inquiry is a priority, there have been times when this has had to take second place behind live, ongoing issues of national security.”

McGahey testifed before Hughes at a two-hour hearing on the Novichok allegations in a London courtroom last Friday, November 11. Follow what was said, and what was meant, in this analysis. An official transcript of the hearing can be read here.

According to McGahey, “approximately 80,000 documents (including emails) have been identified and located as relevant” to the Hughes inquiry. But before any of them can be identified, quoted, or released publicly, McGahey suggested, the government’s Ukraine warfighters will be obliged to down their weapons and pick up censorship tools to prevent the Russians from gaining any advantage.

As Hughes has announced, referring to the allegations of Novichok poisoning, “the responsibility for the events in Salisbury [Skripal incident March 4, 2018] and Amesbury [Sturgess incident June 30, 2018] is what is to be decided by this Inquiry. There is, however, at least a prima facie case (denied by those accused) that those responsible were Russian nationals acting in the interests of the Russian state and allegedly under its direction.”

Exactly what roles in the Ukraine war the “subject matter experts” are playing has not been disclosed. The Russian Government has publicly accused the British Government of providing undersea drone and other technology for attacks on the Nord Stream pipelines, Russia’s Black Sea fleet, a plan of attack against the Kakhovka hydroelectric dam, and nuclear weapons design.

McGahey told Hughes the British Government hasn’t enough money to pay these warfighters to do both the Ukrainian and the Novichok jobs. “There are stretched resources and budgets across HMG [HHis Majesty’s Government], which are not trivial, and there is very real pressure on government departments and agencies.”

Hughes has decided there must be a near-total ban on identifying by name any British official engaged in warmaking against Russia, including intelligence gathering, weapons training, plans and operations.

“The risk of damage to national security here,” he said, ” lies in the risk that hostile actors, whether State or otherwise and, if State, whether Russian or otherwise, might target individuals identified as concerned in the UK reaction to those events, and/or might use access to their names as a means of disrupting UK public functions. I am satisfied, on all the material I have seen, both OPEN and CLOSED, that these are marked real risks to some of those who were involved in the 2018 events, and that Russia in particular has both an interest in such activity and a known capacity to carry it out. For most of these persons therefore, a restriction order is likely to be necessary… [Russia] would have a similar interest in anyone amongst government staff who carried out any sensitive role; an obvious example would be any person concerned in the work of intelligence agencies, or other covert activities, but the risk will not be limited to them. General disclosure of the names of persons subject to these risks would indeed present a hostile actor with a convenient directory of suitable targets and/or a list of sensitive functions which would be of considerable value to a hostile actor accumulating intelligence about UK security and government systems.”

EN_CC_100007.txt,Other,Other,"ESG in action: Unity Foods partners with The Green Ark to recycle plastic waste 

 Karachi - Unity Foods continues to showcase a strong commitment to ESG principles through a partnership with The Green Ark (TGA). A MoU was signed to this effect between both companies whereby TGA will collect and transform scrap materials from Unity Foods to create a diverse array of recycled products intended for reuse. The initiative aims to facilitate the circular economy by mitigating the impact of single-use plastics that contribute significantly towards the deterioration of global ecosystems.

Unity Foods regularly undertakes lasting projects that align with its objectives to reduce the impact of conventional industrialisation on the environment. Under the current partnership with The Green Ark, a leading recycling solutions provider, Unity Foods will not only ensure the traceability of its packaging waste but also highlight a robust commitment to a greener environment by contributing to the circular economy. With an average of more than 13,000 kilogrammes of waste every month including items like garbage debris, oily pouches, plastic jerry cans, tin scraps, plastic bags, and cardboard cartons, a substantial amount of materials will be recycled which will not end up in landfills or incinerators that ultimately damage nature.

“Global warming is a present and potent threat, especially for Pakistan which despite producing a negligible level of greenhouse gases, faces the brunt of the consequences of this global phenomenon. At Unity Foods, we always aim to set a precedent, particularly with our ESG practices that underscore our commitment to ensuring our children can inherit a safe and healthy planet. This partnership with The Green Ark is another step in this direction and we aim to continue commencing similar initiatives in the future,” commented Ms Nageen Rizvi, Head of Corporate Communications and Sustainability, Unity Foods at the signing ceremony. At the occasion, Mr Habib Elahi, CEO, The Green Ark said, “We are committed to reduce the carbon footprint through recycling waste into resin and building materials such as pavers and tiles made from end-of-cycle plastic waste. By this strategic partnership between Unity Foods and TGA, we can ensure that that waste generated is responsibly recycled and adds value in the circular economy.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],esg action unity food partner green ark recycle plastic waste karachi unity food continue showcase strong commitment esg principle partnership green ark tga mou sign effect company tga collect transform scrap material unity food create diverse array recycle product intend reuse initiative aim facilitate circular economy mitigate impact single use plastic contribute significantly deterioration global ecosystem unity food regularly undertake lasting project align objective reduce impact conventional industrialisation environment current partnership green ark lead recycling solution provider unity food ensure traceability packaging waste highlight robust commitment green environment contribute circular economy average kilogramme waste month include item like garbage debris oily pouch plastic jerry can tin scrap plastic bag cardboard carton substantial material recycle end landfill incinerator ultimately damage nature global warming present potent threat especially pakistan despite produce negligible level greenhouse gas face brunt consequence global phenomenon unity food aim set precedent particularly esg practice underscore commitment ensure child inherit safe healthy planet partnership green ark step direction aim continue commence similar initiative future comment ms nageen rizvi head corporate communication sustainability unity food signing ceremony occasion mr habib elahi ceo green ark say commit reduce carbon footprint recycle waste resin building material paver tile end cycle plastic waste strategic partnership unity food tga ensure waste generate responsibly recycle add value circular economy

 RUSSIA is demanding the surrender of Mariupol, while trying to position themselves within range of crucial cities.

At least eight civilians have died in a Russian attack on a large shopping centre just outside the Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

Where are Russian troops in Ukraine now?

An estimate of 190,000 Russian troops have been deployed in and around Ukraine for the invasion.

Russia has admitted around 10,000 of their troops have been killed.

Despite peace talks on the Belarusian border, the Ukraine war rages on with no hint of whether Russian President Vladimir Putin will withdraw his troops.

Russia has military control over much of Ukraine's southern regions but is fighting to take control of Mariupol.

The city is surrounded by Russian forces but Ukraine refuses to surrender.

Ukrainian forces are holding on to important cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv as well as Odesa, which is a crucial connection to supplies.

Capital Kyiv remains under Ukrainian control with the nearest Russian troops about 15 miles from the city centre.

Troops attacked the Retroville mall just outside Kyiv in the Podilskyi district, killing eight civilians.

In the north of the country, Russian troops are attempting to surround the city of Sumy.

Many civilians have joined Ukrainian forces in the fight for their homeland.

RUSSIA LATEST

Which parts of Ukraine has Russia invaded?

Russia has made large sweeps in the south of Ukraine, using Crimea and the separatist supporters in Donetsk and Luhansk.

Troops moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014.

Kherson and Melitopol areas of Ukraine are under control of Russian forces.

There is strong Russian presence in Chernobyl and the surrounding area.

Northern cities of Chernihiv and Konotop, which are closest to the Russian and Belarusian borders, have also been taken.

🔵 Read our Russia - Ukraine live blog for the very latest updates

Why has Russia invaded Ukraine?

Unrest in the Donbas region began in 2014 after the Russian annexation of Crimea.

Pro-Russian demonstrations escalated into fighting with the Ukraine government forces.

The Minsk agreement of 2015 – between the separatist leaders, Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany – sought to end fighting in the region but without success.

The much feared Russian advance began in the early hours on February 21, 2022, soon after Putin announced he recognised Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states in a bombastic TV address.

Joe Biden and Boris Johnson condemned the move as an ""invasion"" and slapped sanctions on Russian banks and Putin's billionaire cronies.

Josh Sigurdson talks with Tim Picciott, The Liberty Advisor about the highest rate of inflation in history if you go by the unofficial numbers as Russia switches to a gold standard to get around sanctions and the US dollar appears to be ready for a complete collapse.

This is the perfect power move for the global establishment. Yes, the US dollar needs to collapse one way or another, but the switch which is being aided by China and Russia will see a massive power shift to ANOTHER establishment world order headed by China. THERE we will see the largest move towards technocracy in the history of the world and perhaps the most dangerous anti-human revolution in human history as well.

THIS is the great reset agenda. While many cheer on Russia or Ukraine, the reality is that no matter what, people will lose as the elites get order out of chaos and allow one establishment to be replaced by another more technocratic establishment.

 What happened: European bureaucrats in dreary Ireland are plotting the murder of roughly 200,000 cows in order to combat so-called climate change.

• Mass execution is one of the options being considered by the Irish government as it scrambles to satisfy the European Union’s draconian emissions targets by 2030.

Context: European libs aren’t the only ones trying to erase cows from existence.

In 2019, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) promoted the controversial Green New Deal legislation using a fact sheet promising to “fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes.”

Why it matters: Liberal activists have long sought to alleviate their personality disorders, sometimes referred to as “climate anxiety,” by killing innocent animals.

• Former president Barack Obama deployed solar farms, wind farms, and other “clean energy” murder machines to execute thousands of bald eagles on his watch.

• More recently, Democrats in New York and New Jersey have started slaughtering harmless whales in order to build a massive and unsightly offshore wind farm in the Atlantic Ocean.

Cows are next on the kill list. Can humans be far behind?

Bottom line: Libs want these adorable creatures to die.

 Accelerating Renewable Electricity Taskforce

Under the Climate Action Plan 2023 (CAP 23) and subsequent CAP 24, Government has set an ambitious target of having an 80% share of electricity generation supplied by renewable sources by 2030 to create a more sustainable and resilient energy system for the future. To achieve the target, Government have committed to achieving 9 GW of onshore wind, 8 GW of solar PV and 500 MW of community energy over the same period.

The establishment of the Accelerating Renewable Electricity Taskforce (""the ARE Taskforce"") was a key measure in CAP 23. The role of the ARE Taskforce is to identify, coordinate, and prioritise the policies required to fast-track and increase deployment of onshore renewable electricity generation and supporting technologies and ensure that barriers to the implementation of those policies are removed or minimised to the greatest extent possible, in order to meet these 2030 CAP targets.

The ARE Taskforce is chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and its membership comprises senior officials from several government departments and state agencies.

Feeding into the Taskforce is a structure of nine Working Groups divided into the three pillars of renewables delivery:

The ARE Taskforce has prepared a programme of work, the ARE Taskforce Implementation Plan, setting out the initial objectives and milestones to deliver the onshore renewables and supporting infrastructure required to support the 80% renewable electricity target by 2030.

The Implementation Plan is a Taskforce-wide strategy and project plan, setting out the roadmap for the activities identified as being required to meet our 2030 onshore renewables targets (9 GW onshore wind and 8 GW Solar PV). The Implementation Plan will be updated periodically, taking into account future iterations of the Climate Action Plan and government policy.

 HUGE explosions have rocked two key electricity supply stations in Russia in a suspected Ukrainian drone strike.

The attack sparked a raging inferno and is understood to have left thousands without power in the Belgorod region.

Belgorod governor said stations were hit in the city and another area in the wider region which borders Ukraine.

He said: ""In Belgorod and the Belgorod region, two fires were recorded at civilian facilities.

""There were no casualties. All emergency services are on site and the fire is under control.""

Reports said parts of Belgorod city - which has a population of 340,000 - suffered blackouts after a targeted strike on a crucial substation in the suburb of Igumenka.

Another in the village of Dragunskoe was hit, according to Baza media outlet which has close links to law enforcement.

The village is some six miles northwest of the city centre.

Belgorod is some 22 miles from the Ukrainian frontier.

Telegram channels said there had been explosions before fires erupted.

There were separate unconfirmed Ukrainian claims that a Murom-P mobile surveillance complex in Belgorod region has been destroyed.

Belgorod region has faced regular drone strikes from Ukrainian territory but not on the scale that Russia has hit Kyiv’s regions.

But Ukraine has also admitted to using sabotage tactics to cause fires in Russia.

Ukrainian intelligence chief Major-General Kyrylo Budanov has said that Russia was seeing many unusual explosions and fires.

“Much of this is no accident,” he said, admitting that Ukraine was paying Russian saboteurs.

“Something is constantly on fire [in Russia].

“Signalling equipment on railways, it lights up several times a day, on various highways constantly for two to three hours, sometimes for five to six hours, traffic gets suspended.”

The suspected strikes come as Ukraine is claimed to be preparing a counteroffensive to grab back territory from invading Russian forces.

Leaked classified US intelligence documents also appear to reveal Ukraine's plans.

One of the documents summarised the training schedules of 12 Ukraine combat brigades, and said nine of them were being trained by US and NATO forces, and needed 250 tanks and more than 350 mechanized vehicles.

The documents - at least one of which carried a ""top secret"" label - were circulated on pro-Russian government channels.

 The key witness in an investigation into the Biden crime family corruption and influence-peddling has gone missing and is feared dead just days before he was due to testify, according to Oversight Committee chair Rep. James Comer (R-KY).

According to Comer, his team has been unable to reach the FBI informant who alleged corruption by Biden and his family, after the bureau dodged a subpoena last week demanding a report detailing allegations that he took bribes while vice president.

“Well, unfortunately, we can’t track down the informant. We’re hopeful that the informant is still there,” Comer told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures.” Comer also said a whistleblower communicating with the committee about the alleged bribery scheme “knows the informant” and is “credible.”

The People’s Voice had the scoop on the missing whistleblower last week. Watch:

Comer told Bartiromo that the Oversight Committee has identified a pattern of intimidation by the Biden White House.

“Nine of the ten people that we’ve identified that have very good knowledge with respect to the Bidens, they’re one of three things: They’re either currently in court; they’re currently in jail; or they’re currently missing,” said Comer.

He said others “want to come forward” about the first family’s history of influence peddling, but they “fear for their lives.”

“Not only are the Biden lawyers and the Biden White House intimidating them — the media is trying to intimidate and discredit them,” according to Comer, who went on to blast committee Democrats for their actions in the probe.

Comer also revealed further details about how the FBI dodged a subpoena demanding details about the corruption case. According to Comer, the whole thing stinks of a high-level cover up.

The FBI objected to handing over the FD-1023 informant report last week, informing the Oversight panel in a six-page letter that the information was “unverified” and may risk the confidentiality of agency sources.

“All we’re asking the FBI with respect to the form 1023 is, ‘What did you do to investigate this allegation?’ And they sent us back a very patronizing letter basically saying, ‘Just trust us and don’t worry about it,’” Comer said Sunday.

“This is a pattern of behavior by the FBI that would suggest there’s been a cover-up for many years with respect to the Biden influence-peddling.”

According to the subpoena, the report on the allegations was “created or modified in June 2020” — the same month that Biden clinched the Democratic presidential nomination — and alleges a “criminal scheme” involving “money for policy decisions.”

The allegations are the first to have directly implicated Biden rather than his scandal-plagued son, Hunter, who is currently facing congressional and federal investigations into his overseas business dealings in countries including China, Ukraine and Russia.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],biden crime family whistleblower miss fear dead say gop oversight committee chair key witness investigation biden crime family corruption influence peddling go miss fear dead day testify accord oversight committee chair rep james comer ky accord comer team unable reach fbi informant allege corruption biden family bureau dodge subpoena week demand report detail allegation take bribe vice president unfortunately track informant hopeful informant comer tell maria bartiromo fox news sunday morning future comer say whistleblow communicate committee allege bribery scheme know informant credible people voice scoop miss whistleblower week watch comer tell bartiromo oversight committee identify pattern intimidation biden white house people ve identify good knowledge respect biden thing currently court currently jail currently miss say comer say want come forward family history influence peddling fear life biden lawyer biden white house intimidate media try intimidate discredit accord comer go blast committee democrat action probe comer reveal detail fbi dodge subpoena demand detail corruption case accord comer thing stink high level cover fbi object hand fd- informant report week inform oversight panel page letter information unverified risk confidentiality agency source ask fbi respect form investigate allegation send patronizing letter basically say trust don worry comer say sunday pattern behavior fbi suggest cover year respect biden influence peddling accord subpoena report allegation create modify june month biden clinch democratic presidential nomination allege criminal scheme involve money policy decision allegation directly implicate biden scandal plague son hunter currently face congressional federal investigation overseas business dealing country include china ukraine russia

 Feds Using ‘Data’ from Temperature Stations That No Longer Exist to ‘Prove’ Global Warming

Once again, we see the fraud of climate change as it has been revealed that the federal government is using “data” from temperature stations that haven’t even existed for years.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses data from its system of temperature stations erected across the nation to predict what the temps will be in the future. They use what is called the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN), which has physical stations all over the country.

But, the problem is, a large number of the stations they claim to be using don’t even exist.

So, how does NOAA use temperature data that doesn’t exist?

Will this presidential election be the most important in American history?

Per Zero Hedge:

The problem, say experts, is that an increasing number of USHCN’s stations don’t exist anymore.

“They are physically gone—but still report data—like magic,” said Lt. Col. John Shewchuk, a certified consulting meteorologist.

“NOAA fabricates temperature data for more than 30 percent of the 1,218 USHCN reporting stations that no longer exist.”

He calls them “ghost” stations.

Mr. Shewchuck said USHCN stations reached a maximum of 1,218 stations in 1957, but after 1990 the number of active stations began declining due to aging equipment and personnel retirements.

NOAA still records data from these ghost stations by taking the temperature readings from surrounding stations, and recording their average for the ghost station, followed by an “E,” for estimate.

So much for “science.”

If you can’t prove it… just make it up.

This is from the “trust the science” fools.

 Three days after Jamie Dimon sparked a marketwide selloff that sent stocks to fresh 2022 lows after he predicted a US recession in “6 to 9” months citing drivers including rising interest rates, persistent inflation, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and warned stocks could drop another 20%, the JPMorgan CEO who is expected to report earnings tomorrow (and hopefully clarify why his bank refuses to move its deposit rate above 0.01% in the process keeping $2.2 trillion in liquidity locked inside the overnight funding facility), doubled down today saying the Fed can’t cool the red-hot economy without bringing on a recession. [bold, links added]

…snip… In separate – and far more provocative -comments made earlier in the day during a JPMorgan investor seminar where he led a fireside chat moderated by JPMorgan’s Gergana Thiel, Dimon made some extremely outspoken comments that you won’t hear on the mainstream media, telling a small group of listeners that was closed to the press that the “President of the United States needs to stand up and say we may not meet our 2050 climate objectives because this is a fucking war.”

He also said, “time to stop going hat in hand to Venezuela and Saudi and start pumping more oil & gas in the USA.”

Echoing what he has said before, Jamie said this is the way the USA maintains its standing, as the future of the world is by pumping more oil and gas and using energy security to ensure Western unity.

And he did say when it comes to ESG that “investors don’t give a shit” warning not to “cede governance to do-gooder kids on a committee.”

Finally, he stressed the need for strong American leadership that is not being provided by either party. His conclusion: the world needs American diplomacy and neither Trump nor Biden can lead the USA.

Fundamentally, Mr. Dimon is right. Fossil fuels provide 80% of our domestic primary energy with an ongoing evolution that has taken about 120 years to build our modern, reliable & affordable domestic energy system. The “energy transition” will not be accelerated by government mandate or fiat. It will be dictated by the laws of physics and the energy imperatives of cost, energy/power density, scale & sustainability. So, Joe Biden can madate we will “openly defy gravity by 2050.” That does not mean we can IMPLEMENT it! We’d better get a fully informed, rational and civilzed debate on energy & attendant environmental policy started soon. Otherwise, the average Americans standard of living will continue to head south. Just ask anyone in the EU how the “Green Dream” is working out. With the current policy course, the U.S is only 2-3 years behind the same DISASTOROUS result…

Jamie Dimon speaks the truth and the Democrats don’t like that. Lower energy costs would lower inflation, but that would require new refineries and some backing from Washington that gives the explorers and drillers confidence. ESG is a money loser. Avoid any entity that promotes it.

 The ball is in the United States’ court as to whether payments due on Wednesday on two Russian dollar-denominated Eurobonds will go through, and Washington should clarify whether the settlements are possible, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said.

The economic cost of Russia’s actions in Ukraine has been fully exposed as President Vladimir Putin’s sanctions-ravaged government teeters on the brink of its first international debt default since the Bolshevik revolution.

Speaking in an interview with RT Arabic, Siluanov said Russia had sent an order on Monday to a correspondent bank for the payment of $117 million in coupons, and that it was now up to authorities in the United States on whether to accept it.

“The capability or incapability of meeting our obligations in foreign currency equivalent does not depend on us, we have the money, we have made the payment, now the ball is in the court, primarily, of the American authorities,” Siluanov said.

Sanctions have cut Russia off from key parts of global financial markets and have frozen nearly half of the country’s $640 billion gold and foreign exchange reserves. Siluanov said the block on its dollar account meant there were risks the payment would not reach the final, intended recipients.

“The payment has reached the correspondent American bank,” Siluanov said. “At the moment the payment is being processed and we do not yet have reports on whether it has gone through or not. It has not been cleared yet.

“But we know that the bank is in talks with OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control) and has requested specific information from us about the purpose of the payment.”

 The great Rush Limbaugh once said, “Climate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government.” Well, a solar company in Arizona is receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies this year, the overwhelming majority of its operating profit. That’s right. Your tax dollars are working to prop up a toxic and unreliable energy source under the Biden administration.

Here is the full quote from Rush Limbaugh:

Climate change is not about climate change. It’s about the people in it getting rich off of an ever-expanding, growing, controlling government. It’s all about expanding the government and government control over people. It’s about creating victims. When you successfully turn somebody into a victim, you have automatically made them a dependent on you. You are essentially telling them they have lost the power necessary to solve their own problems. And you create within them a mentality that they can’t overcome their own problem because they’re victims.

This whole paragraph is absolutely true, but I’m going to focus on the first point made. Climate change certainly allows many young people to feel virtuous for engaging in destructive or pointless demonstrations while they claim that the problems in their lives are caused by some vaguely defined climate catastrophe, one which government has to fix for them. Most of all, however, the climate scam is a way of enriching its proponents in government and business.

The Wall Street Journal reported July 31 that Arizona-based solar panel manufacturer First Solar “expects to receive as much as $710 million this year—nearly 90% of forecast operating profit—from subsidies the U.S. government rolled out a year ago to encourage domestic renewables production.” WSJ added, “One analyst estimates the incentives could be worth more than $10 billion for the company over the next decade.” Talk about hitting the jackpot.

From WSJ:

First Solar expects to have as much as a 60% share of the U.S. market for large-scale solar installations this year, largely a result of government policies that are pushing clean-energy developers to buy more made-in-America components.

The company’s shares have more than doubled to $208.40 in Friday trade since the beginning of 2022, despite a string of earnings disappointments during that period.

The manufacturer has even announced a new factory.

What is not being said here is that solar panels generate lots of toxic waste and are unreliable as an energy source. Also, solar panels have killed billions of birds. Meanwhile, huge swathes of natural scenery and farmland must be ruined to set up solar panels. Solar is also unprofitable when left to survive on its own merits; that’s why so many government subsidies are needed. Solar panels are a terrible choice, both for the environment and for the energy grid. They are not a solution to the fake climate crisis.

 Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville joined Steve Bannon on The War Room on Friday following Joe Biden’s incredibly partisan and completely dishonest State of the Union Address to the American people last night in Washington DC.

During their discussion, Tommy was asked about the climate change craze. The former Auburn coach did not hold back. Tuberville told the War Room audience, “Climate Change is the biggest hoax in the world.” He then added that he believes around 25% of the budget is dumped into climate change policies.

There are obviously a whole lot of grifters getting rich of the “hoax.”

The Democrat Party and their mainstream media will not be pleased with Tommy following his honest assessment of the international scam.

Sen. Tuberville: Oh, the climate, yeah. Oh, it’s biggest hoax in the world. I mean, it’s all a money grab… We come in here at our budgets about near 5 trillion a year. What we run on, we’ve spent since I’ve been here, and I hadn’t voted for any of $7 trillion more than that since we’ve been here. Right. I would say 25% of that, Steve, has gone to climate change.

Steve Bannon: Have they presented you any information or data or analysis that would make you say, some of this climate change stuff might be logical, or is it just all presented as essentially financial, economic voodoo?

Sen. Tuberville: Yeah, they don’t know enough about it. Now, you can get some of these big scientists who come in and try to push, but you look at the graphs and the narratives that they bring in… It’s a hoax. I’m telling you, it is a huge hoax. We’re all for our air, our water, taking care of what we do, but they’re making money off this. And again, that’s the Democrat party. They want to make money off everything they do.

EN_CC_300030.txt,Other,Other,"‘Urgent’ planning reform needed to meet renewable energy targets 

 The planning application process needs “urgent” reform in order to accelerate wind and solar projects to meet national renewable energy targets, a new report has warned.

The report from the Climate Change Advisory Council said the target to increase renewable energy capacity by 1.6GW will not be met without changes to the planning system.

It highlighted that an onshore wind farm was not granted planning permission in the 12 months to September 2023.

This project, which was the only one to receive planning permission from a local authority, is now subject to an appeal.

There were four wind farms granted approval from An Bord Pleanála in late 2023, with all of them currently undergoing judicial review.

Five others were granted permission on conclusion of an appeals process following an original local authority decision.

“These appeals will add significant delays to the development of these projects, making 2030 targets increasingly difficult to achieve.

“Of those applications that received a decision, projects accounting for approximately 20% of wind capacity and 15% of solar capacity were refused,” the report stated.

Offshore

It was also recommended in the report that the Government immediately adopt the plan for the rollout of offshore wind power off the south coast.

This, it said, would avoid further delays in offshore wind generation.

“The council is calling on the Government to finalise and adopt the South Coast Designated Maritime Area Plan by summer 2024.

“Any delay in its publication risks not achieving Ireland’s 2030 offshore wind targets,” the report said.

The report also said Ireland is behind at European level when it comes to offshore wind generation.

Recommendations

Further recommendations from the report include stopping the use of coal and oil to generate electricity, pricing incentives for data centres to shift electricity usage to times of low carbon emissions and publishing a long-term strategy for the delivery of a zero-carbon electricity system.

Ensuring future infrastructure is resilient to projected climate impacts, such as floods, was also recommended.

Solar

There was a 90% increase in applications for solar microgeneration installations last year compared with 2022.

ESB Networks received 33,000 applications for microgeneration installations of up to 6 or11 kVA in 2023, typically domestic rooftop solar PV installations.

Last year, there was an average of 700 applications per week.

 Zelensky Seeks To Cancel Russia At UN, Asks Why ""Russian Terrorists"" Have A Place

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to use his visit to the United Nations in New York to get Russia canceled from the international assembly. He questioned how it is that ""Russian terrorists"" have a seat at the UN. He also warned that Russia is poised to expand its war beyond Ukraine - an assertion with no evidence.

""If in the United Nations there is a place for Russian terrorists,"" Zelensky said, ""it’s a question to all the members of the United Nations."" ...Except that of course Russia doesn't hold just any UN seat, but it's permanent member of the UN Security Council, and exercises veto power in that capacity over the UNSC's most important resolutions and major decisions.

Zelensky made the comments on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), when he visited a hospital in Staten Island which is treating some 18 wounded Ukrainian soldiers. Zelensky has long warned that the UN is ""hostage"" to Russian policy.

As for his UNGA speech the same day, given before some 140 nations, and after Biden spoke earlier, Zelensky went on the verbal attack against Russia, giving comments in English.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said. He laid out that Russia is weaponizing essentials for survival like food and energy.

""The goal of the present war against Ukraine is to turn our land, our people, our lives, our resources into a weapon against you, against the international rules-based order,"" Zelensky said, also seeking to portray a pattern of Putin's ""aggression"" from Georgia to Syria to Moldova.

He also alleged Moscow is committing ""genocide"" - and repeated media claims of Russia having ""kidnapped"" some tens of thousands of children. ""Time goes by; what will happen to them?” He then called it ""clearly a genocide.""

However, these reports of ""Russia kidnapping children"" have been based on the trend of Russian-speaking families of the Donbas in many cases willingly relocating to Russian territory, also given there had been a civil war raging there since 2014 involving pro-Kiev Ukrainians attacking pro-Russian Ukrainians in Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Zelensky also used it as an occasion to condemn any potential peace plan offered by a third party which requires that Ukraine cede territory. The New York Times wrote, ""Ukraine has been seeking backing for a 10-point settlement program that demands a full Russian withdrawal and payment of reparations.""

""Zelensky pitched the audience an idea for a summit with that program on the agenda -- something Ukrainian diplomats say would be a symbolic success, even without any means to enforce such a settlement on Russia,"" the report noted.

The UN audience applauded when at the end of his remarks Zelensky said the world must work to ""end the aggression on the terms of the state that was attacked."" He's expected to later travel to Washington, where he'll lobby for billions more in American taxpayer dollars to be pledged toward the war effort.

Meanwhile, employing his UN-speak, Zelensky for a moment talked about the world body's ""climate policy objectives""...

 Russia ‘could split off from global internet’ – and US fears that Russian web could look like China’s Great Firewall

RUSSIA could split off from the global internet as the Kremlin cracks down on the web, officials fear.

As real war rages in Ukraine, Russia has is pushing ahead with an intense information war online.

A key battleground in the Kremlin's online crackdown is the Russian internet.

Several businesses have shut down their online and physical operations in Russia.

Meanwhile, Kremlin officials led by President Vladimir Putin have blocked access to some of the platforms that have not halted service in Russia.

Instagram, which is three times as popular as Facebook in Russia, was blocked by state officials.

The Kremlin’s plans to isolate Russia from the global internet predate the invasion of Ukraine.

In 2019, Russia passed the Sovereign Internet Law which redirects traffic through Russian servers – allowing a watchful Kremlin to censor the web.

In 2021, the Russian government labeled the internet a national security threat.

This month, Russia’s deputy digital minister Andrei Chernenko directed Russian websites to switch to domain name system (DNS) servers that are within Russia’s borders.

Most read in Tech

In doing so, internet operations in Russia are dependent on hardware within the country which strengthens the state’s ability to control content.

Russian citizens can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to bypass Russia’s rigid internet restrictions.

A VPN shields your IP address, hides your physical location and scrambles the record of your internet history.

But with Visa, Mastercard and American Express suspending operations in Russia, many citizens have no way to pay for web tools to help them evade Russian censorship policies.

Kremlin crackdown

The Russians' work to domesticate the internet is not unlike the Chinese Great Firewall internet policy.

China governs the internet with intense scrutiny and has loads of restrictions against international websites.

The Chinese government has ownership over internet channels and lends access to people and businesses.

Chinese internet users rarely explore web pages that are based or created outside of China.

FreedomHouse, a nonprofit focused on analyzing the strength of freedom across the world, ranked the Chinese internet as one of the least free in the world with a score of 10/100.

The United States, for comparison, has an internet freedom score of 75/100.

In fracturing the internet, China and Russia leave citizens just with state-approved networks as their only source of information.

""They want the ability to move to not one big global network but different networks where you can surveil your citizens more easily,” Karen Kornbluh, an expert on US-European diplomacy, told NBC News.

“In the longer term, Russia wants to be able to cut off access to Signal,” Kornbluh said.

Signal is a secure messaging app used by journalists to avoid government snooping – and it's now the fastest growing app in Russia.

RT, one of Russia’s state-controlled media networks, has pushed false justifications for the invasion of Ukraine and has come under fire for other propagandist tendencies.

By insulating the Russian internet, networks like RT could be the only source of information left for Russian citizens.

Just as he promised to do, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a left-wing Democrat, is going after people’s meat with new plans to save the world from “climate change” by forcing everyone to become a “plant-based” vegetarian or vegan.

Along with representatives from the Mayor’s Office of Food Policy and the Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice, Adams has announced the launch of a new “carbon footprint” and household food consumption tracking scheme that aims to reduce the Big Apple’s “carbon emissions” by 33 percent by the year 2030.


In order to cut all that carbon, Adams and his allies are imposing new “caps on meat” that, as the name suggests, will limit the amount of meat that New Yorkers are allowed to purchase and consume at public institutions – and eventually within their own homes as well.

(Related: Last month, we warned you that Adams was planning to unleash a horrific new food policing apparatus against New Yorkers, and now he has.)

Eric Adams wants all New Yorkers to become vegans

At a pre-Earth Day event held at a Brooklyn culinary center run by NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public health care system, Adams unveiled a chart depicting New York City’s greenhouse gas inventory. This inventory supposedly tracks the carbon footprint generated by household food consumption.

With the help of American Express, C40 Cities, and EcoData, Adams revealed carbon emissions data about household food consumption, which was added to existing carbon emissions data on energy use, transportation, and waste.

Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala from the NYC Department of Environmental Protection unveiled the new household food consumption data. Aggarwala, by the way, also founded the Google smart city subsidiary Sidewalk Labs, which collects data in order to forge “a new standard for what cities have to do” as a novel way to shape policy.

While the inventory that Aggarwala presented will also now include greenhouse gas “pollution” from the production and consumption of consumer goods like clothing, air travel, and health care, Adams focused his efforts at the event specifically on the foods that New Yorkers consume – mainly meat and dairy, which he personally opposes.

“Food is the third-biggest source of cities’ emissions right after buildings and transportation, but all food is not created equal,” Adams unsubstantially stated. “The vast majority of food that is contributing to our emission crisis lies in meat and dairy products.”

“It is easy to talk about the emissions that’s coming from buildings and how it impacts our environment, but we now have to talk about beef. And I don’t know if people are ready for this conversation.”

Other than fish, Adams reportedly abides by a “plant-based” vegan diet, which he says helped him overcome diabetes. He wrote a vegan cookbook to promote his personal dietary choices, which he now wants all New Yorkers to follow in order to stop “global warming.”

“We already know that a plant-powered diet is better for your physical and mental health, and I am living proof of that,” Adams declared. “But the reality is that thanks to this new inventory, we’re finding out it is better for the planet.”

The simplistic way in which Adams couched his argument against meat and dairy has already been debunked by people who are actually educated in such things, including Melissa McKendree, PhD, an agricultural economist at Michigan State University.

“Different meats have different kinds of greenhouse gas footprints,” McKendree clarified about how pasture-raised animals do not harm the environment like feedlot animals do. “All land is not created equal.”",EN,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",nyc begin track food purchase sure resident don consume meat promise new york city mayor eric adams left wing democrat go people meat new plan save world climate change force plant base vegetarian vegan representative mayor office food policy mayor office climate environmental justice adam announce launch new carbon footprint household food consumption tracking scheme aim reduce big apple carbon emission percent year order cut carbon adam ally impose new cap meat suggest limit meat new yorker allow purchase consume public institution eventually home relate month warn adam plan unleash horrific new food policing apparatus new yorker eric adams want new yorker vegan pre earth day event hold brooklyn culinary center run nyc health hospital city public health care system adam unveil chart depict new york city greenhouse gas inventory inventory supposedly track carbon footprint generate household food consumption help american express city ecodata adam reveal carbon emission datum household food consumption add exist carbon emission datum energy use transportation waste commissioner rohit aggarwala nyc department environmental protection unveil new household food consumption datum aggarwala way found google smart city subsidiary sidewalk lab collect datum order forge new standard city novel way shape policy inventory aggarwala present include greenhouse gas pollution production consumption consumer good like clothing air travel health care adam focus effort event specifically food new yorker consume mainly meat dairy personally oppose food big source city emission right building transportation food create equal adam unsubstantially state vast majority food contribute emission crisis lie meat dairy product easy talk emission come building impact environment talk beef don know people ready conversation fish adam reportedly abide plant base vegan diet say help overcome diabetes write vegan cookbook promote personal dietary choice want new yorker follow order stop global warming know plant power diet well physical mental health live proof adam declare reality thank new inventory find well planet simplistic way adam couch argument meat dairy debunk people actually educate thing include melissa mckendree phd agricultural economist michigan state university different meat different kind greenhouse gas footprint mckendree clarify pasture raise animal harm environment like feedlot animal land create equal

The Washington Post has recently revealed the long-known fact that the Ukrainian special services are behind the terrorist attacks on Russian territory. Moreover, Ukrainian terrorists were praised for progress they made during the years-long cooperation with their partners in the US. Inspired by fame, the Kiev regime doubled its efforts to launch more attacks against the Russians. In recent days alone, a lot of the attacks failed but some were partially successful.

On the morning of October 27, pro-Russian politician Oleg Tsarev was targeted with an assassination attempt in Crimea. He was shot and hospitalized with heavy wounds. The victim has been a deputy of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine since 2002. In 2014, he supported the referendum on independence in Donbass and served as the speaker of the Parliament of Novorossiya.

Unfortunately, Oleg Tsarev was far from the first victim of the Nazi Kiev regime, which has been hunting for politicians, journalists and public figures because of their positions for more than a decade.

Kiev also continues attempts to launch terrorist attacks in various cities of Russia. Their goals are to inflict civilian casualties and threaten the population, as well as to discredit the Russian authorities and create the appearance of a national resistance against the Kremlin. To do this, Kiev recruits naive men, often Ukrainians who have moved to Russia, who for monetary rewards go to a life of crime and sacrifice their lives.

On October 26, the FSB announced the elimination of a Ukrainian agent who wanted to stage a terrorist attack on one of the military enlistment offices in Tver.

The man was a member of some “Ukrainian nationalist formation”. He provided Kiev with data on military, fuel and energy facilities in the region. During the arrest, the man resisted and was killed. The FSB seized homemade explosives and an RGD-5 grenade on the spot.

Military enlistment offices are frequently targeted by the Ukrainian special services. Kiev is trying to create the appearance that Russian men do not want to fight and resist the Kremlin’s policies.

Cases have become frequent when Ukrainian scammers under various pretexts forced women to set fire to military enlistment offices in different Russian cities. For example, victims were assured that they should stage the attack to check the effectiveness of local emergency services and so on.

Sometimes Kiev shows more ingenuity to assure Washington that the years of training and funding have not passed for nothing.

For example, a Ukrainian who has been living with his family in Moscow for many years recently tried to poison Russian pilots. Disguised as a courier, he delivered a poisoned cake to their holiday. However, the operation failed, and now the Ukrainian agent will be arrested in a criminal case. Meanwhile, his Ukrainian and American curators will have to search for more naive victims in Russia.

EN_UA_010095.txt,Other,Other,"US official: Russian missiles hit NATO member Poland, killing 2 

 Poland Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has convened an emergency meeting of the country’s National Security Council after reports that a Russian missile that hit Polish territory killed two civilians.

The emergency meeting was announced by cabinet spokesman Piotr Muller on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. Muller did not reveal what the committee was due to discuss and did not offer further comment to Reuters news agency.

The committee talks, which will include senior members of Poland’s government and its intelligence services, come following unverified reports that stray Russian missiles intended for Ukraine have hit a Polish village, killing two civilians.

According to Radio ZET, a Polish commercial radio station, “two stray rockets fell in the village of Przewodów in the Lublin province near the border with Ukraine.”

Russian authorities have denied that the missiles that struck Poland came from Russia.

The station further reported that two people had died at the scene. The Polish military, the police, and the prosecutor’s office have been called to the scene.

Military planes are also understood to have been scrambled.

Polish authorities are yet to confirm media reports that Russian missiles were responsible for the explosion but they were substantiated by a senior U.S. intelligence official to the Associated Press news agency on Tuesday evening.

“The causes of this incident are not known at the moment,” said Marcin Lebiedowicz, a spokesman for the Poviat Fire Brigade in Hrubieszów

“We received a report of an explosion in the drying yard. In fact, upon arrival, we confirm that something like this happened. Two people died on the spot. At the moment, we are securing the scene and lighting the area of the action,” he added.

Kurier Lubelski, a regional Polish news outlet from the affected area has attempted numerous times on Tuesday to verify the details with state officials to no avail.

At 7 p.m. local time, the outlet was told by the local mayor’s office: “I can’t say anything about it. However, there is definitely no need to arouse anxiety. Let’s wait for the exact findings of the services.”

At 7.30 .p.m. local time, the news outlet attempted to speak again with Marcin Lebiedowicz for further information on the incident.

“I’m not allowed to give any information at the moment. I suggest contacting other services,” he replied.

The local police department’s spokesperson has not been available for comment to local media, but Voivode of Lublin Lech Sprawka confirmed he was on his way to the accident site.

Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated that “If Poland confirms that the missiles also hit its territory, this will be a further escalation by Russia. We stand firmly behind our EU and NATO ally.”

Latvia’s Deputy Prime Minister Artis Pabriks stated that the “criminal Russian regime” had hit Poland with missiles, although it is unclear what evidence he has to back his statement at this time.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda said “every inch of NATO territory must be defended.”

Hungarian government spokesperson, Zolan Kovacs, also confirmed via Twitter that Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán had convened an emergency meeting of Hungary’s Defense Council for Tuesday evening “in response to missiles hitting the territory of Poland.”

A U.K. Foreign Office spokesman told Sky News: “We are investigating these reports and liaising closely with allies.”

 DENVER — Denver Public Schools is trying to create the next generation of renewable energy leaders with a special summer program.

“I think the youth are going to be bringing that forward more. They're really sensitive to climate action and also climate anxiety, and so this is a proactive way to really impact their world and the future, as far as making sure that we have a sustainable planet,” Monica Schultz, senior manager for DPS’s Career Navigation Services, said.

Nearly 40 high schoolers are taking part in the Renewable Energy Academy this year — a joint effort between DPS and nonprofit solar company GRID Alternatives Colorado.

""We've went to... workshops at GRID Alternatives... There's harnesses, things that keep you on the roof so you don't... fall off. We were pretty much learning about the safeties of... installing solar panels. And then we would also learn how to install a panel onto a roof,"" Surafel Alemayehu, one of the high schoolers taking part in the program, explained to Denver7.

The students also learned about circuitry.

""We're trying to learn more about, like how the electricity flows into the battery from the DC, the AC, the inverter and so on,"" Alemayehu said.

In addition to visiting GRID Alernatives, participants will take field trips to different renewable energy companies and solar farms across the Denver metro area.

""They get to see the industry in action through partnerships with various businesses in Denver,” Schultz said.

The whole program lasts four weeks.

Once the Renewable Energy Academy wraps up, students like Alemayehu will have the basic skills needed for an entry-level job in the industry.

""I think there's a personal aspect of it in terms of reminding their family to turn off the light when they leave a room. But then there's also the aspect of understanding the career opportunities,"" Schultz said.

EN_UA_022319.txt,Other,Other,"Shapps Says UK Facing ‘Pre-War World’ and Can’t Risk Cutting Defence Spending 

 Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said Britain is in a “pre-war world” and cannot afford to reduce spending on the military.

In a major speech at Lancaster House in London, Mr. Shapps said the “peace dividend” that followed the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s was over.

Mr. Shapps said: “Because the era of the peace dividend is over, in five years’ time we could be looking at multiple theatres including Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.”

“Ask yourself, looking at today’s conflicts across the world, is it more likely that that number grows or reduces? I suspect we all know the answer. It’s likely to grow,” he added.

Mr. Shapps also announced 20,000 British service personnel would take part in NATO’s largest military exercises since the Cold War, following the announcement last week of a £2.5 billion support package to Ukraine.

Over the weekend the RAF carried out air strikes with U.S. forces on the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, after they targeted merchant shipping in their campaign against Israel.

The British government has set a goal of increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP, but Mr. Shapps has argued it should rise to 3 percent.

His speech on Monday—in front of an audience including top brass in the British military—might be seen as pushing the argument for increased defence spending.

Mr. Shapps said, “We made the critical decision to set out our aspiration to reach 2.5 percent of GDP on defence, and as we stabilise and grow this economy we’ll continue to strive to reach that as soon as possible.”

“But now is the time for all allied and democratic nations across the world to do the same thing and ensure their defence spending is growing too,” he added.

‘The Tanks Are Literally on Europe’s Ukrainian Lawn’The defence secretary said: “An age of idealism has been replaced by a period of hard-headed realism. Today our adversaries are busy rebuilding their barriers, old enemies are reanimated, new foes are taking shape, battle lines are being redrawn.”

“The tanks are literally on Europe’s Ukrainian lawn and the foundations of the world order being shaken to their core,” he added.

Mr. Shapps refused to rule out further action against the Houthis following the weekend attacks.

He said the strike against the Houthis was a “single action” but added, “We will now monitor very carefully to see what they do next, how they respond and we will see from there.”

Later Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he would “not hesitate” to protect British shipping in the Red Sea.

Mr. Sunak told Sky News, “As we’ve said, not just to the Houthis but to their Iranian masters, in a sense, because they are really proxies for Tehran, this cannot go on.”

“Freedom of navigation is just a given and always has been for many years. We cannot have that situation where they are trying to harass it, and we will keep a very close eye. If we have to take further action, that is something that we will consider,” he said.

He added, “They should be aware that if it doesn’t stop then of course we will then have to take the decisions that need to be taken.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],shapps say uk face pre war world risk cut defence spending defence secretary grant shapps say britain pre war world afford reduce spending military major speech lancaster house london mr shapps say peace dividend follow end cold war early mr shapps say era peace dividend year time look multiple theatre include russia china iran north korea ask look today conflict world likely number grow reduce suspect know answer likely grow add mr shapps announce british service personnel nato large military exercise cold war follow announcement week billion support package ukraine weekend raf carry air strike u.s force iran back houthi rebel yemen target merchant shipping campaign israel british government set goal increase defence spending percent gdp mr shapps argue rise percent speech monday audience include brass british military see push argument increase defence spending mr shapps say critical decision set aspiration reach percent gdp defence stabilise grow economy ll continue strive reach soon possible time allied democratic nation world thing ensure defence spending grow add tank literally europe ukrainian lawn defence secretary say age idealism replace period hard head realism today adversary busy rebuild barrier old enemy reanimate new foe take shape battle line redrawn tank literally europe ukrainian lawn foundation world order shake core add mr shapps refuse rule action houthis follow weekend attack say strike houthis single action add monitor carefully respond later prime minister rishi sunak say hesitate protect british shipping red sea mr sunak tell sky news ve say houthis iranian master sense proxy tehran freedom navigation give year situation try harass close eye action consider say add aware doesn stop course decision need take

 Josep Borrell, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, called Hungarian Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó’s accusation that the European Union is “pro-war” completely unacceptable,

“This is totally unacceptable. The European Union is not in favor of war. The European Union is not on the side of war,” Borrell said, adding that the EU is supporting Ukraine in its war against aggression by Russia and wants to end the war in accordance with the UN Charter.

Borrell also said the “unacceptable approach” of the Hungarian government regarding Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s visit to Moscow and Kyiv would be discussed at a separate meeting on Monday.

Borrell noted that member states should be looking at how investment and funding could help Ukraine, such as by restoring its damaged electricity infrastructure as soon as possible and providing additional air defense systems.

“These are the two most important things right now,” he stressed.

Borrell also commented on the opinion issued by the UN International Court of Justice (ICJ), which was delivered on Friday, according to which Israel’s settlement policy and use of natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law and Israel must pay reparations to the Palestinians for the damage caused by the occupation.

He said that these conclusions were largely in line with the EU position, which he said was fully consistent with UN resolutions on the status of the occupied Palestinian territories.

 Australian Open bans flags from Russia and Belarus on site

Flags from Russia and Belarus were banned from the site of the Australian Open on Tuesday after more than one was brought into the stands by spectators on the first day of the Grand Slam tournament.

Normally, flags can be displayed during matches at Melbourne Park. But Tennis Australia suspended that policy for the two countries involved in the invasion of Ukraine that began nearly a year ago.

“Our initial policy was that fans could bring [flags] in but could not use them to cause disruption,” Tennis Australia said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday we had an incident where a flag was placed courtside. We will continue to work with the players and our fans to ensure that this is the best possible environment to enjoy the tennis.”

One Russian flag was displayed during Ukrainian player Kateryna Baindl’s 7-5, 6-7 (8), 6-1 victory over Russian player Kamilla Rakhimova on Court 14 in the first round Monday.

Another was offered to Russian player Daniil Medvedev to autograph after his 6-0, 6-1, 6-2 win over Marcos Giron in Rod Laver Arena on Monday night.

Asked about the new flag ban, Belarusian player Aryna Sabalenka said after her first-round victory Tuesday that she would prefer that politics and sports remain separate but that she understands the decision by Tennis Australia.

Jessica Pegula and Coco Gauff each pick up wins in the first round of the Australian Open as they begin their quest for a first Grand Slam title.

“I mean, if everyone feels better this way, then it’s OK,” said Sabalenka, a three-time Grand Slam semifinalist who is seeded No. 5 at Melbourne Park. “I have zero control on it. What can I say? They did it. OK. No flags? No flags.”

Sabalenka was among the athletes from Russia and Belarus who were barred last year from competing at Wimbledon and team events such as the Billie Jean King Cup and Davis Cup because of the war in Ukraine. Russia invaded, with help from Belarus, in February.

Russian and Belarusian players have been allowed to enter the other three Grand Slam tournaments but as “neutral” athletes, so their nationalities are not acknowledged on any official schedules or results for the event and their countries’ flags are not displayed on TV graphics.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],australian open ban flag russia belarus site australian open ban flag russia belarus site flag russia belarus ban site australian open tuesday bring stand spectator day grand slam tournament normally flag display match melbourne park tennis australia suspend policy country involve invasion ukraine begin nearly year ago initial policy fan bring flag use cause disruption tennis australia say statement tuesday yesterday incident flag place courtside continue work player fan ensure good possible environment enjoy tennis russian flag display ukrainian player kateryna baindl victory russian player kamilla rakhimova court round monday offer russian player daniil medvedev autograph win marcos giron rod laver arena monday night ask new flag ban belarusian player aryna sabalenka say round victory tuesday prefer politic sport remain separate understand decision tennis australia jessica pegula coco gauff pick win round australian open begin quest grand slam title mean feel well way ok say sabalenka time grand slam semifinalist seed melbourne park zero control ok flag flag sabalenka athlete russia belarus bar year compete wimbledon team event billie jean king cup davis cup war ukraine russia invade help belarus february russian belarusian player allow enter grand slam tournament neutral athlete nationality acknowledge official schedule result event country flag display tv graphic

 “The Biden administration’s preposterous plan to establish 30,000 megawatts of nameplate Offshore Wind capacity by 2030 was always a pipedream. It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.” ( – Joseph Toomey, below)

Talented amateurs are often better than the ‘professionals’ when it comes to dissecting U.S. energy policy. Or maybe I have it reversed. The pros are those in the trenches and the amateurs are the ones on high.

So let’s call Joseph Toomey, independent management consultant, an expert. Here is his recent post about the much-in-the-news problems of the offshore wind industry under Biden Energy Policy.

Not long ago, this thread reiterated a resolute, long-standing belief that Offshore Wind is neither practical nor affordable, even in high-tax Democrat-governed Blue States of the U.S. Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions. Four proposed Offshore Wind projects had collapsed into miserable failure after project sponsors demanded increased public subsidies of as much as 65% above the already wildly-inflated feed-in prices they had previously been promised by New York State.

Just this week, it was New Jersey’s turn to be left looking like adolescents for pretending that Offshore Wind could ever become a viable option for supplying the electricity needs of that state’s ratepayers at affordable levels.

Note the delicious fury from New Jersey’s Governor Phil Murphy who proclaimed that:

“Today’s decision by Ørsted to abandon its commitments to New Jersey is outrageous and calls into question the company’s credibility and competence.”

It was Murphy himself whose competence had been called into question by backing these wildly infeasible ideas.

If this sounds a little too much like a “Spike the Football” moment for our valuable readership, you have my deepest condolences. I just fell off my armchair laughing at the hilarious incompetence of our renewable energy-promoting political class. The day can’t come soon enough when real adults return into leadership positions to pull humanity back from the brink of extinction events that actually exist, as recent troubling global developments adequately demonstrate.

The Biden administration’s preposterous plan to establish 30,000 megawatts of nameplate Offshore Wind capacity by 2030 was always a pipedream. It’s what you get when you put the children in charge.

The badly-needed adult supervision delivered by marketplace realities has now demonstrated to sentient humans that there was never a chance in the whole universe that Biden’s absurd plan could ever be realized.

Comments on Post

Some of the many comments that followed either confirmed the obvious or suggested the way forward.

The obvious from Robert Borlick: “Notice how many days with no output? This is why wind needs to be backed up with dependable generators that can be ramped up to serve the load.”

The way forward from Ken Urkosky: “All this subsidy funding should go to building infrastructure capable of withstanding the harsher weather events we’re told to expect! That would be much more effective in reducing the impacts of climate change vs trying to control our Earth’s climate.”

And Borlick, an important voice in the electricity debate, has had enough with offshore wind:

I strongly opposed the OSW projects that were approved by the Maryland Public Service Commission in 2017 and again in 2021. Both awards violated Maryland law by not conducting valid cost-benefit analyses, which would have eliminated all but one project (US Wind). I tried to persuade the Maryland People’s Counsel to sue the MPSC but they wimped out – both times.

Now the crazies in the Maryland legislature want to approve even more OSW but this time they want to hide the huge subsidies by paying them out of general tax revenues, instead of through the more visible electricity rate increases.

My hope is that cost increases will kill the Maryland projects just as they did the New Jersey projects.

 July 15, 2023

More than a third of Americans are under heat advisories as extreme temperatures are likely to hit several states in the United States this weekend, BBC reported.

About 113 million people in the US have been affected by the advisories from Florida to Texas to California up to the north-western state of Washington.

The extreme temperatures have forced the residents to use air conditioners while people have broken the record for power consumption in Texas since last year.

As many as 27 million people are expected to suffer from high temperatures of over 43°C in the coming days.

According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the heat is caused by an upper-level ridge of high pressure, calling it ""one of the strongest"" systems to be experienced by the region.

""The subtropical ridge responsible for this likely historic heatwave across the region is not showing signs of letting up anytime soon,"" the NWS said.

The estimated number of people to die from heat-related incidents in the US is 700, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

The daytime temperatures are expected to remain up to 46°C (today) while the heat is forecast to remain until next week.

The temperatures in Phoenix are likely to hit or exceed 43°C in the next five days, breaking its longest hot spell which lasted 18 days.

Las Vegas may experience 47°C in the next few days while Death Valley, California is also expected to surpass its all-time high temperature of 54°C.

A warning was issued to the Las Vegas residents by the NWS. ""'It's the desert, of course its hot'- This is a DANGEROUS mind set! This heatwave is NOT typical desert heat due to its long duration, extreme daytime temperatures, & warm nights. Everyone needs to take this heat seriously, including those who live in the desert,"" it said.

The extreme heat has also forced the closure or shortening of hours of parks, museums, zoos and businesses.

Moreover, hospitals are also seeing cases related to heat.

""We're getting a lot of heat-related illness now, a lot of dehydration, heat exhaustion,"" said Dr Ashkan Morim, who works at Dignity Health Siena Hospital, outside of Las Vegas.

Meanwhile, the heatwave has also grappled Europe which led to the closure of a major tourist attraction in Greece on Friday.

 Moscow court rejects Evan Gershkovich’s appeal, keeping him in jail until at least June 30

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich will remain jailed on espionage charges until at least late June, after a Moscow court Tuesday rejected his appeal that sought to end his pretrial detention.

The 32-year-old U.S. citizen was detained in late March 2023 while on a reporting trip and has spent more than a year in jail, with authorities routinely extending his time behind bars and rejecting his appeals. Last month, his pretrial detention was continued yet again — until June 30 — in a ruling that he and his lawyers challenged. A Moscow appellate court rejected the appeal Tuesday.

In the courtroom on Tuesday, Gershkovich, wearing a white T-shirt and an open checked shirt, looked relaxed, at times laughing and chatting with members of his legal team.

His arrest in the city of Yekaterinburg rattled journalists in Russia, where authorities have not detailed what, if any, evidence they have to support the espionage charges.

U.S. journalist marks a year in a Russian prison as courts keep extending his time behind bars

Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich marks a year behind bars Friday following his arrest by Russian authorities who accuse him of espionage.

Gershkovich and his employer have denied the allegations, and the U.S. government has declared him to be wrongfully detained.

Analysts have pointed out that Moscow may be using jailed Americans as bargaining chips in U.S.-Russian tensions over the Kremlin’s war on Ukraine. At least two U.S. citizens arrested in Russia in recent years — including WNBA star Brittney Griner — have been exchanged for Russians jailed in the United States.

In December, the U.S. State Department said it had made a significant offer to secure the release ofGershkovich and Paul Whelan, another American imprisoned in Russia on espionage charges, that it said Moscow had rejected.

Officials did not describe the offer, although Russia has been said to be seeking the release of Vadim Krasikov, who was given a life sentence in Germany in 2021 for the killing in Berlin of Zelimkhan “Tornike” Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen descent who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya and later claimed asylum in Germany.

A Russian court extends the pretrial detention for American reporter accused of spying

A court in Moscow ruled to keep Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich in custody pending his trial on espionage charges.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, asked this year about releasing Gershkovich, appeared to refer to Krasikov by pointing to a man imprisoned by a U.S. ally for “liquidating a bandit” who had allegedly killed Russian soldiers during separatist fighting in Chechnya.

Beyond that hint, Russian officials have kept mum about the talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeatedly said that while “certain contacts” on swaps continue, “they must be carried out in absolute silence.”

Gershkovich is the first U.S. reporter to be arrested on espionage charges in Russia since 1986, when Nicholas Daniloff, a Moscow correspondent for U.S. News and World Report, was arrested by the KGB. Daniloff was released 20 days later in a swap for an employee of the Soviet Union’s United Nations mission who was arrested by the FBI, also on spying charges.",EN,['Other'],['Other'],moscow court reject evan gershkovich appeal keep jail june moscow court reject evan gershkovich appeal keep jail june wall street journal reporter evan gershkovich remain jailed espionage charge late june moscow court tuesday reject appeal seek end pretrial detention -year old u.s citizen detain late march reporting trip spend year jail authority routinely extend time bar reject appeal month pretrial detention continue june ruling lawyer challenge moscow appellate court reject appeal tuesday courtroom tuesday gershkovich wear white shirt open check shirt look relaxed time laugh chat member legal team arrest city yekaterinburg rattle journalist russia authority detail evidence support espionage charge u.s journalist mark year russian prison court extend time bar wall street journal reporter evan gershkovich mark year bar friday follow arrest russian authority accuse espionage gershkovich employer deny allegation u.s government declare wrongfully detain analyst point moscow jail americans bargaining chip u.s.-russian tension kremlin war ukraine u.s citizen arrest russia recent year include wnba star brittney griner exchange russian jail united states december u.s state department say significant offer secure release ofgershkovich paul whelan american imprison russia espionage charge say moscow reject official describe offer russia say seek release vadim krasikov give life sentence germany killing berlin zelimkhan tornike khangoshvili -year old georgian citizen chechen descent fight russian troop chechnya later claim asylum germany russian court extend pretrial detention american reporter accuse spy court moscow rule wall street journal reporter evan gershkovich custody pende trial espionage charge russian president vladimir putin ask year release gershkovich appear refer krasikov point man imprison u.s ally liquidate bandit allegedly kill russian soldier separatist fighting chechnya hint russian official keep mum talk kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov repeatedly say certain contact swap continue carry absolute silence gershkovich u.s reporter arrest espionage charge russia nicholas daniloff moscow correspondent u.s news world report arrest kgb daniloff release day later swap employee soviet union united nations mission arrest fbi spy charge

In the aftermath of Russia's move to shut a major pipeline, prices of European gas surged 20 per cent, Bloomberg reported. It caused fears that the move will lead to a prolonged supply halt.

The report mentioned that benchmark futures rose toward 300 euros a megawatt hour. The electricity and coal prices also surge to fresh records.

The recent developments show that the Europeans are preparing for a difficult winter without gas supplies from Russia. It is part of the fallout from the war in Ukraine, which started after Russia announced the invasion of its neighbouring country on February 24.

In the report, it is mentioned that the key Nord Stream pipeline will stop for three days of maintenance on August 31. This has raised concerns that the link won't return to service as planned after the works.

This comes after Bulgaria announced that it will seek talks with Russian energy giant Gazprom to resume deliveries of natural gas ahead of the winter season.

The deliveries were cut by Gazprom to Bulgaria in late April after the EU member's previous centrist government refused to pay in rubles.

Ever since the supplies were cut, the nation, which is almost totally dependent on Russia for its annual consumption of 3.0 billion cubic metres of natural gas, had been looking for alternative deliveries.

Meanwhile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday (August 22) at the start of a two-day trip. During this crucial trip, the two leaders are expected to discuss energy cooperation.

Notable, Ukraine is at odds with Germany over its gas imports policy.

Especially regarding the deal with Moscow to build the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and also the deal with Canada to get a repaired turbine for the Nord Stream 1 delivered back to Germany.

No date was given for when the existing plants would have to go, but other Biden regulatory actions and international commitments already in the works had meant no coal by 2035.

This is crazy and fascistic, as he calls for the elimination of a vital energy resource.

John Kerry demands the end of coal plants.— Daniel Turner (@DanielTurnerPTF) December 4, 2023

Here's what Kerry won't tell you:

- Coal is inexpensive, abundant, and reliable

- Solar manufacturing plants run on coal

- Wind manufacturing plants run on coal

- EV battery factories are powered by coal

Facts matter. pic.twitter.com/V8cX2injQu

Kerry says there shouldn't be any more permanent coal-fired power plants permitted anywhere in the world. He said that's how you can do something for ""health."" He said he finds himself getting more and more ""militant"" because he does not understand ""how adults [who] are in positions of responsibility can be avoiding responsibility for taking away those things that are killing people on a daily basis. And the reality is that the climate crisis and the health crisis are one and the same.""

Yikes! How dare anyone disagree with him, he seemingly thinks, while he's trying to crush industries and the jobs associated with them? We get that the Biden team doesn't care about that, as they race pell-mell ahead with their agenda.

But it gets worse, as Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) point out. While the Biden team is pushing for this radical agenda that would limit and harm the U.S., Kerry gave China a pass by locking them into the status of a ""developing country"" according to the Paris Agreement, which Kerry helped to negotiate.

“At the time the Paris Agreement was signed, China was the world’s second largest economy, and had been so for many years. Nevertheless, the treaty you negotiated and agreed to locked into place China’s status as a developing country. That was as absurd then as it is now,” the senators wrote. [....]

“China is bent on global domination. It is the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is America’s chief economic and geopolitical rival. It exploits forced labor. It manipulates global markets. It steals our technology. It is building hypersonic missiles and a blue-water navy,” the senators wrote. “It should not get special treatment in international climate agreements. There should be no more free rides for China. That should be non-negotiable.”

But it's the Biden team, where giving China a pass seems to be baked in, so they're building all the coal plants they can. And they're using them to help build all the green energy stuff that the Biden team wants to shove down our throats.

China is acting within, and taking advantage of, the international framework you helped create—the Paris Agreement. The Chinese coal plants to which you object now power mines and refineries producing critical minerals. They drive factories building solar panels, wind turbines, and electric batteries and cars that the Biden Administration wants to force Americans to buy.

So it's a double win for China, courtesy of the Biden administration. Once again, bad Democratic policy hurting the United States and being hypocritical.

 The Royal College of Physicians has abandoned science, and become a green ideological campaigning organisation.

The RCP’s “green physician toolkit” is precisely the same patronising nonsense as the WHO’s toolkit of the same name, discussed in my Daily Sceptic article a few months ago.

The two main ideas behind the toolkit are

a) that doctors routinely make “unnecessary” decisions that have environmental impact, and that

b) they should use their authority to advance an ideological agenda.

For example “reduce blood testing where clinically appropriate”. This assumes that doctors test people’s blood frivolously, something equivalent to an “unnecessary journey”. Very, very odd.

But the most egregious claim, of course, is that “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to human health”.

That is so far from truthful, and so utterly embedded in green ideology, that the word “lie” is not sufficient.

There is less than zero evidence that climate is a “threat to human health”, let alone the “biggest threat”. The evidence debunking the link between climate change and health is so strong that doctors have to go out of their way to conceal the stats.

You can see the raw data here for yourself. Climate-related mortality has fallen in recent decades. Diseases of poverty, which are claimed to be climate-linked, including malaria, are also in steep decline.

I give an overview of how climate-activist doctors at the Lancet are influenced by ideology here, and go into more detail to explain how they lie in this presentation below. At around 36 mins, I show that the Lancet’s green propaganda pages hide the mortality statistics behind “frequency of event” statistics, to give the opposite impression.

The Lancet claims that “life-threatening extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent”. When you interrogate the data, however, it reveals that far fewer people are being killed by extreme weather.

So it’s not just a lie, it’s a fraud. And it’s a fraud told for political effect, to transform society and the economy, which ultimately will have a devastating effect on human health. And it already is, if we calculate the opportunity cost for people in emerging economies.

Doctors and medical researchers involved in this propaganda have invented their own metric of “risk” to create “evidence” of a growing “threat”. And doctors and institutions of medicine that reproduce this propaganda do so *uncritically* without checking the numbers.

The numbers are not complicated. The science is not complicated. The data is not hard to find. This is not like 5-sigma high energy physics experimentation.

Consider this chart from the latest Lancet propaganda report, for example. It claims that the better part of a $trillion is lost from agricultural production because of exposure to heat. But look at how small that effect is in the West, compared to developing/low income economies.

Whereas farmers in the US can tend to vast farms, sitting in GPS-guided, air conditioned, diesel-powered tractors, subsistence agriculture is dawn-to-dusk manual labour.

The difference is access to fossil fuels. It’s not a weather or climate effect.

To frame that disparity between agricultural producers in the richest and poorest economies as one of “climate change”, requiring the abolition of fossil fuels is a grotesque injustice. It is vile.

EN_CC_200150.txt,CC: Criticism of climate movement,CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist,"Despite Yields Doubling, NYTimes Claims Vanilla Is Disappearing From Climate Change 

 The New York Times is attempting to stoke climate alarm this week with an article claiming the world’s favorite scent – vanilla – is about to disappear because climate change is eradicating vanilla plants. [emphasis, links added]

In reality, objective data show vanilla production has doubled since the year 2000, and the current market is saturated with oversupply.

The Times article, “This Is How the World’s Favorite Scent Disappears,” notes vanilla is the world’s favorite scent and is used in a wide variety of perfumes and other products.

Citing anecdotal events like a cyclone that hit Madagascar several years ago during its annual cyclone season, the Times claims supersized cyclones are putting vanilla plants on the verge of extinction.

Interestingly, although the Times published its article just yesterday, the best anecdotal “evidence” for the asserted vanilla extinction was a cyclone that hit Madagascar way back in 2017 during its cyclone season.

According to the Times, Madagascar produces 80 percent of the world’s vanilla – actually, it produces significantly less than 80 percent – and:

“As a result [of the 2017 cyclone], the price of vanilla bean pods surged to nearly $300 a pound. The increasingly erratic weather, along with pressure to cut the forests that harbor the orchids, is particularly worrisome for farmers…”

So, why does the Times provide just anecdotal ‘evidence’ of climate change ravaging vanilla crops, and why does the Times have to go back to 2017 to find any such anecdotal evidence?

The answer is that objective facts expose the Times’ claim as false.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides detailed information on global crop production, including vanilla. According to the UN data, global vanilla production has doubled from 3.9 million kg of vanilla in 2000 to 7.7 million kg in 2022.

There is so much vanilla being produced that farmers are complaining about low vanilla prices caused by overproduction.

“The 2023 vanilla crop is expected to be one of the best harvests in the last two decades, forecasted at 2,500 tons with exceptionally high quality,” observes the Nielsen-Massey 2023 Crop Report.

The Crop Report observes that recent strong production has created a market oversupply. “The oversupply has led to aggressive price reductions, posing economic challenges for vanilla farmers as they sell their 2022 crop at low prices to meet their daily living needs,” the Crop Report adds.

Wow, talk about the New York Times getting the story completely backward and wrong!

The New York Times points to a cyclone that hit Madagascar seven years ago during its cyclone season and caused a very short-term spike in vanilla prices.

That is its sole “evidence” of climate change making vanilla go extinct.

In reality, vanilla production is so strong that the market is saturated with vanilla, … making farmers complain about low prices.

The New York Times and other “mainstream” media outlets have a long history of identifying popular foods, beverages, and luxury items that climate change is allegedly destroying.

As is the case with all other such items that have come to Climate Realism’s attention, vanilla is becoming more abundant rather than less abundant as the planet modestly warms.

 Globalist poster boy Trudeau wants money for climate alarmism and Ukraine Nazis.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is faring miserably in the polls, watching the Conservative opposition lead grow wider, and – what’s worse – witnessing the virtual demise of his prized, signature climate alarmist policies, crystallized on the ‘carbon tax’.

Today, the conservative leader Pierre Poilievre delivered blistering speech against the Prime Ministers misguided ‘Ukrainian’ priorities in the context of an accelerating social crisis.

They stood in the same hallowed hall where Trudeu had them applaud, with pomp and circumstance, a former Nazi fighter.

Pierre Poilievre:

""Mr. Speaker, this Prime Minister, I understand what he's doing.

He has imposed so much misery here at home, whether by doubling housing costs, forcing people into tent encampments, forcing 2 million people to go to a food bank.

These are problems here at home, at the kitchen table.

He is so desperate to talk about anything else that avoids him talking about what's happening in our own country.

So will he answer the question?

Will he take his [Carbon] tax off our farmers so our people can afford to eat?""

Trudeau had an evasive answer, said Poilievre wants to 'score political points', but the relevant fact, to me, is that, right beside him, while he pleaded for money for Kiev, stood his deputy prime minister Christina Freeland, herself descendent of Ukrainian-Canadians that were reportedly involved in Nazi groups.

This brief exchange summarizes the status quo in Canadian politics: Trudeau has broken the economy, but all he really cares about is money for climate alarmism and for the Ukrainian Nazis.

 The climate change lobby is blissfully unaware of the consequences of being wrong. We are constantly reminded that higher electric bills are for our own good or that living with less is a moral choice. Most of us get poorer, but those who bet on carbon reduction and electric cars are making a killing.

There's a story, perhaps apocryphal, that during the siege of Stalingrad, children were given prizes of small pieces of cake for every rat they were able to catch. At the rate our civilization is going, we may be holding similar contests before too long.

Political scientist Roger Pielke Jr. notes, ""It's quite intuitive for people to understand that there's a lot of power in solar energy. We feel the wind. The idea that you can get something for nothing, people find enormously appealing.""

Except it's not ""something for nothing."" And we're paying extra for ""renewable energy"" despite all the promises.

California now requests all new homes to have solar panels. John Stossel points out that in addition to the solar panels, ""all new cars sold in 2035 to be zero emission, and all the state's electricity to come from carbon-free resources by 2045."" Anyone who questions this orthodoxy is dismissed as a crank.

But the fact is that we're hurtling toward a future where our energy needs are going to far exceed our ability to supply energy at any price. The reason is that we are deliberately removing viable choices for energy creation to ""save the planet.""

California is getting results in its renewable experiments. The problem is that they're not good results and only promise to get worse.

People in Washington state pay about 11 cents per kilowatt-hour. In Oregon, 13 cents. In California, now almost 30 cents.

Do they at least get reliable energy for that? No.

The big problem with wind and solar power, of course, is that they don't work when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine. Sometimes that happens when people most want heat or air conditioning.

Increased use of ""renewables"" is why blackouts are more common in California. Bloomenergy says there were over 25,000 in 2019—thousands more than the previous year.

""We failed to predict and plan,"" said Gov. Gavin Newsom. Right.

Instead, they embraced unscientific green fantasies.

Only by the grace of God and flyover country voting for Republicans have we been able to avoid the fate of Californians. But the California contagion will spread unless we're more vigilant. Biden has already relaxed his electric car mandate that would have required 67% of new cars sold by 2035 to be EVs after pressure from the auto unions. But other mandates on emissions remain.

This next election will determine whether we're going to have abundant energy for our future or whether our kids will become expert rat catchers.

 Ukraine abandoned a draft peace treaty with Russia in 2022 due to British pressure, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has claimed.

The deal, which could have ended the Ukraine conflict weeks after it first began, was approved by negotiators in Istanbul, but Ukraine later pulled out of the talks.

RT reports: The German newspaper Welt reported on Friday that Moscow had issued additional demands after a deal had already been outlined, such as making Russian the second official language in Ukraine, implying that this had ended any hopes of an agreement.

Peskov denied those claims on Saturday, citing remarks made by Ukrainian MP David Arakhamia, who led Kiev’s delegation at the talks.

In an interview to domestic media last November, Arakhamia said then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had intervened in the peace process and had urged the Ukrainians to “just fight” Russia.

Kiev effectively discarded the deal under “direct pressure by London,” Peskov stressed. “The rest is speculation. I suggest we learn from the source.”

Asked whether the draft treaty could serve as a basis for further peace talks, Peskov said Kiev’s public position was to reject talks with Russia. The idea of reviving the failed agreement was floated by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko when he met Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin earlier this month.

Johnson has denied derailing the peace talks, but has also bragged on multiple occasions about his policy of nudging Kiev into continuing hostilities with Russia, which the British politician claims to be a fight for global democracy.

“There could be no more effective way of investing in Western security than investing in Ukraine, because those guys without a single pair of American boots on the ground are fighting for the West,” Johnson told students at Georgetown University during a visit to the US this month. The Ukrainians “are effectively fighting our own fight, fighting for our own interests,” he added.

Russian officials have described the Ukraine conflict as a Western proxy war against Moscow, which the US and its allies allegedly intend to wage “to the last Ukrainian.” Their goal, according to Moscow, is to contain Russia and stall its development, rather than protect the interests of the Ukrainian people.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors']",russia say britain block ukraine peace deal ukraine abandon draft peace treaty russia british pressure kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov claim deal end ukraine conflict week begin approve negotiator istanbul ukraine later pull talk rt report german newspaper welt report friday moscow issue additional demand deal outline make russian second official language ukraine imply end hope agreement peskov deny claim saturday cite remark ukrainian mp david arakhamia lead kiev delegation talk interview domestic medium november arakhamia say british prime minister boris johnson intervene peace process urge ukrainian fight russia kiev effectively discard deal direct pressure london peskov stress rest speculation suggest learn source ask draft treaty serve basis peace talk peskov say kiev public position reject talk russia idea revive fail agreement float belarusian president alexander lukashenko meet russian counterpart vladimir putin early month johnson deny derail peace talk brag multiple occasion policy nudge kiev continue hostility russia british politician claim fight global democracy effective way invest western security invest ukraine guy single pair american boot ground fight west johnson tell student georgetown university visit month ukrainians effectively fight fight fight interest add russian official describe ukraine conflict western proxy war moscow ally allegedly intend wage ukrainian goal accord moscow contain russia stall development protect interest ukrainian people
EN_CC_100235.txt,Other,Other,"Mitigating climate change brings economic benefits 

 Editor's note: Jin Jun is an associate professor at the School of Management, Zhejiang University. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.

Mitigating climate change fosters a cooperative and symbiotic relationship between carbon neutrality, sustainable economic and social development, which is mainly manifested in the following two aspects.

On the one hand, actions to mitigate climate change and improve the ecological environment can yield direct and indirect economic benefits for socio-economic development. Green and sustainable development can propel the growth of society, from enterprises and businesses to regions and whole nations.

(1) New innovative entrepreneurial opportunities and job positions emerge in response to the need to slow climate change. Innovative entrepreneurship opportunities and employment positions related to carbon neutrality continue to sprout up. For example, as ""carbon"" becomes a strategic asset, enterprises have a substantial demand for professionals in carbon accounting and management, resulting in a surge of new job positions. Relevant technologies and market applications also attract a multitude of innovators and entrepreneurs.

(2) The industrial revolution is evident during the process of mitigating climate change, as emerging industries rapidly develop and gradually replace existing ones. For instance, the swift development of the new energy industry and its supporting sectors in recent years has driven the development of the energy storage industry. Additionally, new energy vehicles are gradually replacing traditional fuel ones, leading to changes in the competition landscape and core technologies of the automotive industry. The application of digital and intelligent technology aids the manufacturing industry in achieving the goal of green transition and carbon neutrality, contributing to the high-end transformation of industries and enterprises.

(3) Emerging strategic resources become crucial for enterprises to attract investment and financing. Green initiatives have become a resource for enterprises to attract investment and financing. ESG(environment, social and governance) ratings have become a crucial indicator of whether companies can obtain financing and loans. Carbon trading will also bring companies new revenue sources. Resources like sunlight, water, and wind have evolved into crucial resource endowments for enterprises and countries. Countries and regions abundant in these new and crucial strategic resources will witness shifts in their domestic and international influences.

(4) Demonstration of international competitiveness and industry leadership is linked to the capacity for green innovation and the ability to achieve carbon neutrality. These factors influence the proactiveness and competitiveness of various organizations and countries in global business activities and international business affairs, as well as their international image and market reputation. These capabilities have become essential tools and means to address regional crises. Companies like CATL and BYD have become industry leaders in the global new energy market. Chinese enterprises have contributed to the sustainable environmental and social development of regions including Asia, Africa, and Latin America, facilitating their development and growth in these regions. Meanwhile, the implementation of the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), for example, demonstrates that the ability to reduce carbon emissions will affect enterprises’ import and export costs and international competitiveness.

(5) Improved quality of life for people is a result of environmental protection and improvement, which reduces the adverse impact of harsh environments on health. This, in turn, lowers the demand for medical resources and elevates the overall quality of life, indirectly accelerating socio-economic development.

On the other hand, socio-economic development further promotes innovative entrepreneurial activities that mitigate climate change. Market-driven technological applications propel the iterative upgrading of green technologies, thus driving overall technological innovation.

EN_UA_300075.txt,Other,Other,"In Sign of Support, US Bombers Fly Over Dubrovnik, Balkans 

 A pair of U.S. Air Force B52 strategic bombers on Monday flew low over the Croatian resort of Dubrovnik and three other NATO-member states in the region as a sign of support amid the Russian aggression in Ukraine.

In addition to the walled Croatian tourist resort of Dubrovnik, the aircraft flew over the government headquarters in Skopje, North Macedonia, the downtown Skanderbeg Square in the Albanian capital, Tirana, and up the Adriatic coast of Montenegro.

The Balkans and the Adriatic Sea have lately seen increased military, intelligence and propaganda activity by Moscow, which considers the region of its strategic interest because of its access to the Mediterranean.

“The purpose of each flyover is to demonstrate U.S. commitment and assurance to NATO allies and partners located in southeastern Europe,” the U.S. Air Force said in a statement. “Additionally, this will provide citizens an opportunity to take photos, videos, and enjoy the aircraft flying overhead.”

Crowds gathered on the squares in Skopje and Tirana, and tourists watched in Dubrovnik and Montenegro as the giant bombers thundered overhead. Some onlookers waved American flags.

North Macedonia was the last nation to join NATO in 2020 and Montenegro did it in 2017, both despite strong opposition from Russia.

North Macedonia’s Army Chief of Stuff, Lt. Colonel Jovan Azmanovski, told TV broadcaster Kanal 5 that the bombers’ flights were symbolic proof that “our skies are safe.”

“People in North Macedonia were able to see a flights of USAF B52 two strategic bombers over Skopje, which demonstrate our NATO membership and the safety and security of our and skies of entire alliance. Our skies are safe and our (NATO) membership is more than visible,” Azmanovski said.

In Tirana, Albanian Army Chief of Staff Arben Kingji said “we are witnessing a strategic military demonstration.""

“Our strategic partners are hand to hand with us, it’s a message of unity,"" he said at the square where people gathered.

The two B-52 Stratofortress aircraft are assigned to the 23rd Bomb Squadron currently operating out of RAF Fairford, United Kingdom.

Since 2018, the U.S. has conducted more than 200 Bomber Task Force sorties with allies and partners.

Most recently, this involved B-1B Lancer flights over the Nordic, Baltic, and Black Sea regions in May, as well as an air policing overflight of North Macedonia in June. In June, Stratofortresses conducted flights over the Arctic Ocean, and later took part in BALTOPS, the largest annual exercise in the Baltic Sea.

In the Baltic Sea, the amphibious warship USS Kearsarge -- the largest warship ever to visit Lithuania — was officially welcomed Monday. The country borders fellow NATO member Poland and Belarus, a Moscow ally.

On Monday, the NATO air police mission in Lithuania reported that jets were scrambled four times last week to identify and escort Russian war planes, which violated rules of international airspace.

EN_UA_DEV_26.txt,URW: Russia is the Victim,URW: Russia is the Victim: Other,"How Nikita Khrushchev Exposed the Hypocrisy of US Interventions 

 For American interventionists living today, all that one needs to know is that Russia invaded Ukraine. End of story. Black and white. Russia bad. Ukraine good. Support Ukraine with U.S. taxpayer-funded cash and armaments. America good.

If we go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, we find that things are not so simple, especially for American interventionists, even if they don’t realize it.
The Soviets had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba that had the capability of hitting U.S. cities along the Eastern seaboard, including Washington, D.C., and New York City. The crisis lasted from October 16 through October 29, 1962.

President Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove their nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union. The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites, followed by a full-scale regime-change military invasion of the island. In other words, they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine. In fact, the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin “If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.”

On October 27 — two days before the crisis was resolved — Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy stating the following:
But how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your actions, which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.

You are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations between our great states? This is irreconcilable.

Do you see the problem? Khrushchev was pointing out the hypocrisy of the U.S. position, a position that American interventionists today simply cannot recognize, owing to their blind allegiance to the U.S. national-security establishment.

The fact is that the Soviets had the legal authority to place their nuclear missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to join NATO. Cuba, like Ukraine, is a sovereign, independent country and, therefore, had the legal authority to permit the Soviets to install their missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to permit the U.S. and NATO to install their nuclear missiles in Ukraine.

But even though such legal authority exists, no one, including both Russians and Americans, likes to have nuclear missiles pointed at himself, especially from just a few miles away. This is the point that Kennedy was making when he stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA, he was willing to risk all-out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles, even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install them in Cuba. He, the Pentagon, and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States.

But that’s precisely how the Soviets felt as well, which is what Khrushchev was expressing in his letter to Kennedy. He was essentially saying, “Hey, you don’t like our missiles in Cuba because they are so close to your country. That’s exactly how we feel as well, not only about your missiles over here that are painted at us but also about all your military bases with which you have surrounded us. How come you can’t understand that?”

Well, Kennedy did come to understand that. That’s how he and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal, one that infuriated the U.S. national-security establishment as well as American interventionists.
The deal consisted of two major parts: First, Kennedy vowed that he would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and, second, Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff were livid. They considered Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history. They compared his actions during the crisis to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler at Munich.

For their part, American interventionists were also furious over Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis. As far as they were concerned, the Pentagon and the CIA had the “right” to install their nuclear missiles wherever they want and the Soviets did not have the “right” to do the same. It’s a position that American interventionists still hold today.

Can you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to “national security”?

EN_CC_100040.txt,Other,Other,"Forest management activities in Washington State

 Business Finland is hosting an unprecedented visit by a large delegation from the North American forest and wood products industry, marking a significant milestone in international collaboration. Over 60 delegates from nine U.S. states and Nova Scotia, Canada, are touring Finland to gain insights into the country's advanced forestry practices and innovative wood-based technologies.

For five days, the delegates will visit various Finnish industrial plants, research institutions, and universities.

They will explore forestry management, wood construction, and logging practices across southern, central, western, and eastern Finland. The aim is to familiarize the North Americans with Finland's forest expertise, sustainable forest policies, carbon reduction strategies, and the diverse operations of the Finnish forest industry.

Ulla Lainio, Senior Advisor at Business Finland Washington D.C., stated, ""The large group is touring industrial and forest sites to share knowledge about forestry, forest management, wood building, and logging. This visit reflects the significant interest in Finland's forest innovations.""

The delegates are particularly interested in Finland's manufacturers of forest machines and wood construction equipment, as well as new bio-products such as wood-textile fibers, wood-based building materials, and biofuels. The goal is to foster collaboration in smart forestry, forest health, wood construction, and biomass sectors.

The U.S. forest industry has traditionally been underutilized due to cheap fossil energy and abundant hydropower. However, with the Biden administration's renewed focus on combating climate change, there is a growing interest in biofuels, biomass utilization, forest fire prevention, and advanced forest management technologies. The Inflation Reduction Act provides grants and tax incentives for the forestry sector, making this an opportune time for international collaboration.

Wooden house building is common in North America, with a high demand for suppliers of wood construction equipment, prefabricated house solutions, and CLT (Cross-Laminated Timber) and LVL (Laminated Veneer Lumber) production lines. The delegation aims to find efficient construction solutions to address housing shortages and achieve carbon neutrality.

Finland, along with Sweden, is a global leader in the forest bioeconomy. The North American delegation seeks partners in both industry and research to support the renewal and diversification of the forestry sector.

Outi Suomi, Circular Transition for Zero Waste Mission Lead at Business Finland, emphasized, ""The forest policy is now favorable for reforms, and there is unprecedented interest towards Finland. The collaboration and mutual business opportunities for Finland's and North America's forest industries are significant.""

During their stay, the delegation will visit notable companies and research institutions, including Koskisen, Veisto, VTT, Pinomatic, UPM, Stora Enso, Metsä Group, Ponsse, University of Eastern Finland, John Deere, Business Joensuu, Natural Resources Institute Finland, Kira Hub, and Aalto University. They will also meet with over 25 forest sector companies showcasing innovative wood-based products, advanced wood construction techniques, and forest fire prevention solutions.

The delegation includes top officials responsible for forest use from Michigan, Minnesota, Washington, Colorado, Arkansas, California, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, and Nova Scotia, as well as representatives from leading research universities, sawmills, major forestry companies, forest owners, logging companies, wood architecture firms, and investors.

This historic visit is expected to pave the way for significant collaborations and advancements in the global forest industry, highlighting Finland's pivotal role in sustainable forestry and wood innovation.

EN_CC_100083.txt,Other,Other,"Energy transition opens new vistas for solar, wind power companies 

 by Xinhua writer Shi Hao

BEIJING, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Over the past three months, Anhui Huasun Energy Co., Ltd. has been racing against time to make solar modules for a gigantic photovoltaic project in China's Xinjiang.

These 1.8-gigawatt modules using advanced heterojunction technology will be installed at a 4-gigawatt solar power plant, which is located on the edge of China's largest desert, the Taklimakan.

""For Chinese companies in the photovoltaic industry more than 20 years ago, raw materials, technologies and markets relied heavily on foreign countries and regions. But now, the tide has totally turned,"" Huasun's chairman Xu Xiaohua said.

In east China's Anhui Province, where Xu's company is based, the photovoltaic industry has snowballed in the past five years. The number of companies in the business with an annual revenue exceeding 10 billion yuan (about 1.43 billion U.S. dollars) rose to 11 in 2023.

The boom, which is also recorded beyond Anhui, is underpinned by China's vigorous efforts to expedite a comprehensive transition to green growth as tasks remain daunting.

China aims to raise the proportion of non-fossil energy consumption to around 25 percent of total energy consumption by 2030, which means the country must make every effort to increase the ratio by one percentage point annually in the next few years.

""The proportion of coal consumption in China's total energy consumption stood at 55.3 percent in 2023, and thus the potential for green and low-carbon energy transition is great,"" said Li Zheng, director of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University.

China is already revving up the transition to green energy. Official data released this week showed that the installed capacity of solar power came in at approximately 750 million kilowatts in the first eight months of 2024, rocketing 48.8 percent year on year, and the installed capacity of wind power grew 19.9 percent to some 470 million kilowatts.

Pan Huimin, deputy head of the National Energy Administration's new and renewable energy department, said the rapid development of the new energy sector in recent years resulted from full market competition, a sound business environment, constant tech innovation and a complete industrial chain.

To meet the requirement of exports and foster green industrial and supply chains, Chinese enterprises' demand for clean electricity is experiencing ""explosive growth,"" Pan said in the latest episode of the China Economic Roundtable, an all-media talk platform hosted by Xinhua. The new episode was broadcast Friday.

A key challenge is fully harnessing unstable wind and sunlight and transmitting power to users, often hundreds or thousands of kilometers away.

Last month, users in Beijing started receiving solar and wind power generated in the northwestern province of Gansu after the energy was delivered via extra-high-voltage transmission lines, benefiting Gansu companies in the business and meeting the Chinese capital's demand for green energy.

China unveiled an action plan last month to speed up building a ""new electricity system."" According to the document, Chinese authorities will use advanced power generation, regulation and control technologies to increase the transmission of clean electricity through the grid.

Local governments and enterprises should seize opportunities and vigorously exploit wind and solar power in line with local resources and with the capabilities of the grid to absorb the generated electricity, Pan said. ■",EN,['Other'],['Other'],energy transition open new vista solar wind power company xinhua writer shi hao beijing sept xinhua past month anhui huasun energy co. ltd race time solar module gigantic photovoltaic project china xinjiang .-gigawatt module advanced heterojunction technology instal -gigawatt solar power plant locate edge china large desert taklimakan chinese company photovoltaic industry year ago raw material technology market rely heavily foreign country region tide totally turn huasun chairman xu xiaohua say east china anhui province xu company base photovoltaic industry snowball past year number company business annual revenue exceed billion yuan billion u.s dollar rise boom record anhui underpin china vigorous effort expedite comprehensive transition green growth task remain daunt china aim raise proportion non fossil energy consumption percent total energy consumption mean country effort increase ratio percentage point annually year proportion coal consumption china total energy consumption stand percent potential green low carbon energy transition great say li zheng director institute climate change sustainable development tsinghua university china rev transition green energy official datum release week show instal capacity solar power come approximately million kilowatt month rocket percent year year instal capacity wind power grow percent million kilowatt pan huimin deputy head national energy administration new renewable energy department say rapid development new energy sector recent year result market competition sound business environment constant tech innovation complete industrial chain meet requirement export foster green industrial supply chain chinese enterprise demand clean electricity experience explosive growth pan say late episode china economic roundtable media talk platform host xinhua new episode broadcast friday key challenge fully harness unstable wind sunlight transmit power user hundred thousand kilometer away month user beijing start receive solar wind power generate northwestern province gansu energy deliver extra high voltage transmission line benefit gansu company business meet chinese capital demand green energy china unveil action plan month speed build new electricity system accord document chinese authority use advanced power generation regulation control technology increase transmission clean electricity grid local government enterprise seize opportunity vigorously exploit wind solar power line local resource capability grid absorb generate electricity pan say

 CIA's Burns & SecDef Austin In Separate 'Urgent' Trips To Ukraine As War Effort Implodes

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday showed up in Kiev during an unannounced visit, and at an awkward moment for US-Ukraine relations given President Zelensky has been publicly complaining over a decrease in artillery shell supplies, given they are now going to Israel for its war in Gaza.

""I was honored to meet with President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv today to reaffirm the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine,"" Austin wrote on X. ""We, along with our allies and partners, will continue to support Ukraine’s urgent battlefield needs and long-term defense requirements,"" Austin added.

This convenient shift of Washington and the Pentagon to talking mainly about ""long-term defense"" began occurring as it became clear Ukraine's counteroffensive was failing.

But Congress has been dragging its feet on passing Biden's latest supplemental funding requests - again given there's been some wrangling over what gets sent to Israel vs. what's set aside for Ukraine.

This is Austin's second trip to Kiev since the Russian invasion. ""I’m here today to deliver an important message – the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia’s aggression, both now and into the future,"" he said.

Just last week, CIA Director William Burns also made a secretive, unannounced visit to Ukraine to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials. Commentary in Asia Times has concluded that this flurry of activity is in response to how badly things are going on the battlefield. Washington has invested many tens of billions of dollars into what's clearly a 'proxy war' against Russia. Asia Times wrote:

Wednesday, November 15th is Z-Day for the War in Ukraine. CIA Chief William Burns will arrive in Kiev for urgent, secret meetings with Zelensky. It is worth asking: How come Burns is on an urgent mission to Ukraine?

The answer to the question is that Ukraine is imploding. The crumbling of the Zelensky regime is unsurprising: Ukraine has been sustaining far too many casualties to survive for much longer. Ukraine either must find a way to make a deal with Russia or face an internal rebellion.

Indeed, there have been recent media rumors and rumblings that Washington has begun to quietly push Kiev to the negotiating table. Was this in any way the focus of these new visits by Burns and Austin?

""The Russian strategy is to bleed-down Ukraine’s armed forces and create a political crisis in Kiev,"" the Asia Times report continued. ""The Russian effort is ahead of schedule, which has surprised Moscow as much as Washington.""

Zelensky has lately sacked and replaced many within his own war cabinet. All of this is a sign of deepening friction, also as Zelensky has admitted that the Gaza crisis has taken the international attention off of Ukraine's war efforts. This has led to waning monetary and weapons support as well.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: West is tired of Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Ukrainian army is collapsing', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Situation in Ukraine is hopeless', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",cia burn secdef austin separate urgent trip ukraine war effort implode cia burn secdef austin separate urgent trip ukraine war effort implode defense secretary lloyd austin monday show kiev unannounced visit awkward moment ukraine relation give president zelensky publicly complain decrease artillery shell supply give go israel war gaza honor meet president @zelenskyyua kyiv today reaffirm united states steadfast support ukraine austin write x. ally partner continue support ukraine urgent battlefield need long term defense requirement austin add convenient shift washington pentagon talk mainly long term defense begin occur clear ukraine counteroffensive fail congress drag foot pass biden late supplemental funding request give wrangle get send israel vs. set aside ukraine austin second trip kiev russian invasion today deliver important message united states continue stand ukraine fight freedom russia aggression future say week cia director william burns secretive unannounced visit ukraine hold urgent meeting zelensky military intelligence official commentary asia times conclude flurry activity response badly thing go battlefield washington invest ten billion dollar clearly proxy war russia asia times write wednesday november th day war ukraine cia chief william burns arrive kiev urgent secret meeting zelensky worth ask come burn urgent mission ukraine answer question ukraine implode crumbling zelensky regime unsurprising ukraine sustain far casualty survive long ukraine find way deal russia face internal rebellion recent medium rumor rumbling washington begin quietly push kiev negotiate table way focus new visit burn austin russian strategy bleed ukraine armed force create political crisis kiev asia times report continue russian effort ahead schedule surprise moscow washington zelensky lately sack replace war cabinet sign deepen friction zelensky admit gaza crisis take international attention ukraine war effort lead wane monetary weapon support

 KREMLIN propagandists have called for London to be “turned to dust” after Ukraine said it would use British missiles.

The deranged ranting was part of a nightly show dedicated to pro-war discussion on state TV that’s hosted by a notorious Putin acolyte.

Last night’s show featured discussion of a report in The Sun saying Kyiv said it would use the Storm Shadow missile if the UK was willing to provide it.

At one point host Vladimir Solovyov bizarrely raised his hand as if to cast a spell, then stared manically at the camera and said: “London will turn to dust! To dust.”

Mad Vlad's mouthpiece, his face twisted with rage, then switches to English and begins shouting: “Burn in hell!” and “Flames!”

Solovyov was responding to a panellist who made a wildly exaggerated claim about a news story published by The Sun.

He fumed: “The British press is saying ‘We’ll give them hell! I’m quoting verbatim from their most popular paper The Sun.

“They all regard this as completely fine - ‘Russians can and need to be killed’. They’re saying that constantly.

“There’s one problem with Russians. They won’t give up as easily as that.”

The clip and its translation was tweeted by BBC Monitoring, which regularly posts on pro-Kremlin propaganda shows.

It comes after Volodymyr Zelensky asked for 600mph British missiles when he visited the UK recently with a shopping list of weapons.

Ukrainian defence sources Kyiv would be prepared to use the missiles to strike Crimea

It followed a warning from Zelensky that longer-range weapons from western allies would allow Ukraine to take the battle to areas occupied by Russian.

""It will allow us to make the evil completely retreat from our country by destroying its airbases deep in the occupied territories,” he said during his visit.

In response, Rishi Sunak said “nothing is off the table” when it comes to military support for Ukraine.

The Government is still weighing up whether to send deadly Harpoon anti-ship missiles or surface-to-air Storm Shadows to arm Ukrainian defenders.

After Germany finally agree to send tanks, Solovyov, and other Kremlin propagandists threatened nuclear strikes on the West.

In a similar rant he claimed it meant Germany had joined the war.

Solovyov said: ""It’s time to send a clear, resolute message that we now consider Germany a direct party to the conflict, rekindling memories of World War Two.

“German tanks appearing [in Ukraine] will definitely mean we consider German territory, military bases and other sites as legitimate targets.”

Raging Moscow TV pundit Yevgeny Satanovsky said warheads should be launched on the German capital Berlin and the country’s parliament, the Bundestag.

“Flat, slightly radioactive, melted-down ground [will remain in its place].”

Ukrainian defenders are bracing for an assault that could include 1,800 tanks, 3,950 armoured vehicles, 400 fighter jets and 300 helicopters incoming from Russia.

 We have seen, time and again, the hypocrisy of the extreme environmental movement, especially the climate-change wing of this movement — most of whom don't live anywhere near the actual environment. From Al Gore's mansion to John Kerry's private jets to Leonardo DiCaprio's mega-yacht, these people are all really big on ""Do as we say, not as we do.""

And it's worth digging a little deeper into the issues behind the net-zero issue, that being the advocacy for net zero carbon emissions, something that is all but impossible. Why? Because of the things required for the manufacture of electric vehicles (EVs); specifically, their batteries and, even more specifically, the raw materials required to make those batteries.

This brings us to Indonesia and the environmental havoc that mining for nickel, an essential component of EV batteries, is wreaking on that country.

Swathes of rainforest and coastal communities are being destroyed by a nickel mining boom in Indonesia sparked by the race to transition away from fossil fuels.

Across the country, a major drive to exploit the country’s abundant natural resources is underway. These photographs capture the sheer scale of the production process.

Rows of chimneys, belching smoke and fumes, tower over the schools and houses of what were once rural communities in scenes recalling the work of L.S. Lowry, whose paintings captured life in the industrial districts of North West England in the mid-20th century.

Indonesia is now the world’s largest nickel producer, with 15 per cent of the globe’s lateritic nickel resources – typically low-grade deposits found near the surface.

But demand is still soaring in tandem with the rise of the electric vehicles (EVs), which depend on it for their batteries.

Guess who is, in large part, funding all this?

Billion dollar Chinese firms anchor the nickel market in Indonesia, but they are often fed cheap ore by hundreds of smaller, mostly locally-owned mines that dot the rainforest. These mines have transformed once-peaceful agrarian villages and communities, providing economic opportunity but a health and environmental crisis looms from pollution.

In just three years, Indonesia has signed more than a dozen deals worth more than $15 billion for battery materials and electric vehicle production with global manufacturers including Hyundai, LG and Foxconn.

Granted, nickel extraction will probably go on regardless of the EV push, regardless of the net-zero goals of climate scolds, and we should remember that extraction and refining bring jobs to impoverished communities in Indonesia. That's not the point that we should be examining here.

It's the hypocrisy of the climate scolds ignoring these inescapable consequences of their agenda that's galling.

That's always been the whole problem with these people; they never count the cost, all the costs, of the agenda for which they advocate. They are of a kind with (and in many cases are the same people) who complain about, say, my going into the woods to shoot a grouse or a snowshoe hare for supper, demanding to know why I can't get my meat at a grocery store so no animal has to die. They are of a kind with the ""Stop Oil"" protesters who block traffic for hours, forcing people to sit with their car engines idling, pouring still more exhaust into the air. They are of a kind with the Greta Thunbergs of the world, ill-informed scolds who want to dictate the end of our modern, technological lifestyles.

They never figure situations like the mining of nickel for EV batteries in Indonesia into their calculus, any more than they account for the mining of cobalt with slave labor in Congo, or mining for lithium and its accompanying environmental disturbance.

To put it bluntly, they are hypocrites of the worst sort. Why do they ignore these problems with their policies? Is it just because these particular environments are far away and out of sight of these mostly affluent, mostly Western activists?

Or are they just ignorant?

In a recently unearthed video of the College of Global Public Health Center for Bioethics at New York University Director, Dr. Matthew Liao, speaking at the 2016 World Science Festival, he openly advocates artificially inducing a red meat allergy in the entire human population, using an analog of the algha-gal molecule found in the Lone Star Tick that I have documented previously at Armageddon Prose, so as to fight “climate change.”


“People eat too much meat. And if they were to cut down on their consumption on meat, then it would actually really help the planet.

But people are not willing to give up meat. Some people will be willing to, but other people – they may be willing to but they have a weakness of will. They say ‘this steak is just too juicy, I can’t do that.’ I’m one of those by the way.

So here’s a thought. So it turns out that we know a lot about — we have these intolerances… For example, I have a milk intolerance. And some people are intolerant to crayfish. So possibly we can use human engineering to make the case that we’re intolerant to certain kinds of meat, to certain kinds of bovine proteins…

There’s this thing called the Lone Star tick where if it bites you, you will become allergic to meat… So that’s something we can do through human engineering. We can possibly address really big world problems through human engineering.”

This level of evil – openly plotting to trigger autoimmune disease in humans without their consent at the population level – is nearly unspeakable.

At the same forum, Liao advocated “editing” humans to become “so small that we get eaten by cats,” again for the sake of “climate change.”

Were these psychopaths to succeed with this and any of their many other bioengineering projects under the guises of Public Health™, fighting “climate change,” etc., then nothing the Third Reich did, or even fantasized doing in Dr. Mengele’s wildest dreams, to the undesirables would remotely compare.

This is a war – of a different kind than we have seen historically – “unrestricted warfare,” as the CCP calls it — but a war nonetheless. As such, we need Nuremberg II now. People like Matthew Liao are not civilians; they must be reclassified as enemy combatants and given military tribunal trials.

I don’t know how this is going to be politically feasible, given the highly controlled and totally compromised political machine in the US and across the West, “penetrated” by the WEF, in the words of Klaus Schwab, as they are.

EN_UA_102953.txt,Other,Other,"Russian celebrities labelled as 'foreign agents' for supporting Ukraine challenge Putin in court 

 A Moscow court on Monday disclosed that several Russian artists, who were labeled as “foreign agents” for publically supporting the Ukrainian government, have submitted appeals against the tagging.

According to the Zamoskvorechye district court, appeals have been filed by TV host and comedian Maksim Galkin, actor and musician Semyon Slepakov, blogger Ilya Varlamov, and singer Zemfira.

All four individuals left Russia last year and were branded as foreign agents following their public statements in favour of Kiev.

Galkin, who was designated as a foreign agent in September 2022 for engaging in “political activities” on behalf of a foreign government, appeared in a video where he was heard chanting slogans of Ukrainian nationalists during a concert in Dubai, which surfaced in January.

Galkin, a comedian known for hosting Russia’s version of the quiz show ‘Who Wants to Be a Millionaire’ from 2001 to 2008, had performed alongside Ukraine’s future President Vladimir Zelensky in a New Year’s Eve special in 2013.

Galkin, aged 46, and his wife, 73-year-old Soviet pop icon Alla Pugacheva, fled to Israel during the escalation of the Ukraine conflict.

Pugacheva condemned Galkin’s designation and expressed her demand to be included on the list as well.

Last week, Zemfira, a rock musician who rose to fame in the early 2000s, submitted her appeal to the court, according to reports.

Born as Zemfira Ramazanova, she was added to the foreign agent list in February 2023 after criticizing the “war in Ukraine” and relocating to France.

Towards the end of March, Varlamov’s inclusion in the registry was announced.

As per the Russian Ministry of Justice, the architect and video-blogger specializing in urbanism was accused of spreading false information about government policies and receiving support from foreign entities.

Notably, Varlamov had already departed from Russia by that time and claimed to have obtained a passport from Turkmenistan.

On April 14, Slepakov was designated as a foreign agent.

The Justice Ministry justified this decision by citing his receipt of support from foreign sources, his opposition to the special military operation in Ukraine, and his involvement in promoting negative sentiments towards the Russian people, military, and government.

In a satirical song released in January, Slepakov portrayed a Russian mother expressing grief over her three-year-old child not being able to participate in warfare.

The TV comedian, screenwriter, and producer had relocated to Israel before his designation.

The foreign agents law, enacted in late 2012, allows for the identification of Russian individuals and nonprofit organizations engaged in political activities and receiving funding from abroad.

Although it does not impose civil or criminal penalties, unlike its U.S. counterpart that served as its model, those labeled as foreign agents are burdened with demanding reporting obligations.

 Warning US hospitals are ‘most vulnerable to cyber attack that will be more devastating than 9/11’ in wake of Covid

AMERICAN hospitals are most vulnerable to a cyberattack that would be more devastating than the September 11 terror attacks, an expert fears.

Professor Scheherazade Rehman, director of the European Union Research Center (EURC), warned that the healthcare sector has been ""exacerbated"" by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Rehman said financial institutions have upgraded their cyber defenses over the past decade - unlike healthcare.

She told The Sun: ""We don't have anything that the banks are doing in healthcare settings from hospitals to healthcare delivery centers.

""If your card has been hacked, the bank can lock it down and switch the number.

“But you cannot change your blood type, you can’t change if you’ve had cancer, you can’t change your date of birth or your DNA. Healthcare information once hacked is not reversible.

“Simply changing someone’s birthday is enough to disrupt the entire US online health system and fixing it would be very, very difficult.”

The expert said that a potential cyberattack on institutions would be “more crippling” than a terrorist attack.

She added: “9/11 was a shock event. It was traumatic as we had never seen anything like it before.

Most read in Tech

“But, the real disruption to people, companies, and systems of governance is going to be a cyberattack.”

In June 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force warned in a report that healthcare cybersecurity is in a “critical condition”.

The dossier stated: “Healthcare cybersecurity is a key public health concern that needs immediate and aggressive attention.”

Researchers at the computer hardware company IBM say that healthcare firms on average take around 236 days to detect a data breach, and 93 days to mitigate the damage.

This compares to the average of 207 days to identify and 73 days to contain a cyberattack.

'EASY TARGETS'

And, US hospitals have around 10-15 networked medical devices per bed on average, meaning officials are working to secure machinery that’s easy to breach, according to Wired.

Analysts at the Brookings Institute believe “the fate of healthcare security” depends on whether investments in cybersecurity are made.

They said: “Just as a responsible healthcare professional seeks to identify and treat patients’ underlying chronic conditions before they cause a serious medical emergency, so too must responsible healthcare organizations address vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure to prevent cyberattacks.""

Fears of a potential cyberattack on US institutions are rising amid the crisis in Ukraine.

Department of Homeland Security officials warned that the US is on “heightened alert” for a potential cyberattack from Moscow.

Rehman believes an attack on the US is ""highly likely"" should the crisis in Eastern Europe escalate.

Pentagon officials warned Friday that a Russian invasion of Ukraine would result in a ""horrific"" aftermath.

Moscow has amassed around 100,000 troops at the Ukrainian border - something which Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he hadn't seen in the past four decades.

Rehman said: “A US response would probably set off what we believe will be the world’s first large-scale cyberwar.

US IN 'WARFARE STATE'

“The Russians have been doing cyber-espionage and pre-positioning operations – meaning they’re setting up vulnerabilities in our infrastructure which means when they’re ready, they can release. It might not necessarily be tomorrow.”

R.P. Eddy, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Ergo, warned that the US is already in a “warfare state” with Moscow, Fox News reports.

He told governors: “What’s Russia’s next move? [It’s] very likely is to increase cyberattacks. It’s an easy move for them.

“We are already in a warfare state right now and we need to be aware of that.”

Jen Easterly, Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA), warned said officials are taking any ""rippling effects"" of a potential Russian invasion “very seriously”.

My opinion : Oil wars Might get out of hand ! or is it a distraction ?

Get ready for global oil supply shock – IEA

Russia could shut 30% of its crude oil output from April if it doesn’t find buyers

Russia could be forced to cut crude production by nearly a third starting next month, as traders are reportedly reluctant to buy oil from the country amid Western sanctions, the International Energy Agency warned on Wednesday.

“The prospect of large-scale disruptions to Russian oil production is threatening to create a global oil supply shock. We estimate that from April, 3 mb/d [million barrels per day] of Russian oil output could be shut in as sanctions take hold and buyers shun exports,” the agency writes in its latest Oil Market Report.

Only Saudi Arabia and the UAE hold substantial spare capacity that could immediately help to offset a Russian shortfall, the Agency says, adding that other OPEC nations are complying with the agreement to increase supply by “modest” monthly amounts.

According to the IEA, surging commodity prices and international sanctions against Russia following its military operation in Ukraine are expected to “appreciably depress global economic growth.”

The US, the UK, Canada, and Australia banned imports of Russian oil earlier this month, affecting some 13% of Russia’s exports. International oil companies quit joint ventures with Russian crude oil producers, overseas banks stopped dealing with Moscow, and the European Union announced a ban on investment in Russia's energy sector.

Brent crude futures jumped nearly 6% on Thursday to nearly $104 per barrel. US West Texas Intermediate crude is gaining over 5% and trading above $100 a barrel.

 Nigeria, others urged to increase funding for research on climate change

The Nigerian government and other African governments have been urged to increase funding and support for research on emerging climate change issues.

The call was made at the recently concluded African Health Agenda International Conference (AHAIC) 2023. Delegates at the event and their governments were reminded that research on issues such as climate-health nexus, carbon removal and green cities across Africa can no longer be pushed to the periphery.

Deputy Director General of Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), Faustin Munyazikwiye, said climate research funding needs the political goodwill of African countries so that they align the research to the specific challenges they want to tackle.

“We can think globally but act locally and find home-grown solutions. We need to establish our funds from our domestic sources before we seek international help,” he said.

Head of Capacity and Field Development at Wellcome Trust, Modi Mwatsama, said African governments need to do a lot of mobilisation for investment in research that is evidence-based and relevant.

“We must encourage our governments to have climate strategies and increase their budgets for research. They also need to work with other stakeholders to make sure the research can help the people they are meant for,” said Ms Mwatsama.

According to a study published in the journal, Climate and Development, more than 75 per cent of funds earmarked for climate research in Africa go to institutes in the US and Europe.

The study says there is already a deep funding deficit in Africa, with less than five per cent of the funds allocated to climate research globally focusing on Africa.

“Of the $620 million that financed Africa-related climate research between 1990 and 2020, research institutions based in Europe and the United States received $480 million while the ones in Africa got only $89.15 million,” says the study.

Ms Mwatsama said this skewed financing of Africa-related research can only be solved by Africans themselves developing a more active approach to research funding and building a strong financial base for research, adding that, “even as we mainstream the health agenda in the climate arena, we need to build a constituency that can articulate cross-cutting issues such as indoor health, clean water, agriculture and nutrition.”",EN,['Other'],['Other'],nigeria urge increase funding research climate change nigeria urge increase funding research climate change nigerian government african government urge increase funding support research emerge climate change issue recently conclude african health agenda international conference ahaic delegate event government remind research issue climate health nexus carbon removal green city africa long push periphery deputy director general rwanda environment management authority rema faustin munyazikwiye say climate research funding need political goodwill african country align research specific challenge want tackle think globally act locally find home grow solution need establish fund domestic source seek international help say head capacity field development wellcome trust modi mwatsama say african government need lot mobilisation investment research evidence base relevant encourage government climate strategy increase budget research need work stakeholder sure research help people mean say ms mwatsama accord study publish journal climate development cent fund earmark climate research africa institutes europe study say deep funding deficit africa cent fund allocate climate research globally focus africa million finance africa relate climate research research institution base europe united states receive million one africa get million say study ms mwatsama say skewed financing africa relate research solve african develop active approach research funding build strong financial base research add mainstream health agenda climate arena need build constituency articulate cross cutting issue indoor health clean water agriculture nutrition
EN_CC_300074.txt,Other,Other,"Africa Youth Partnership — Liberia Youth Task Team launches Climate Justice Community Engagement and Awareness Campaign 

 Monrovia, Liberia — the Africa Youth Partnership — Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT) in partnership with ActionAid Liberia hosted a Climate Justice Community Engagement and Awareness Campaign at the People United Community Palava Hut on 20th Street, Beachside, Monrovia, Liberia.

The Campaign, which is an activity under the Strategic Partnership Agreement, brought together leaders and residents of the People United Community, LYTT members, the media, etc., gears toward raising awareness about Climate Change and Environmental injustices and to sensitize community residents about sustainable climate practices.

After the opening formalities, the Campaign begin with an Introduction to the Campaign by the Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT) Climate Justice & Environmental Project Lead, Madam Yundeh Afreda Butler, a staunch climate advocate and environmentalist.

During her deliberation, she called for a transition to renewable energy and agroecoly, also addressing climate change driven conflict, and its’ effect on women and girls.

She encouraged the audience to engage into sustainable climate actions that will enhance environmental sustainability.

“She informed the audience that the campaign seeks to rally support from more than five million people worldwide including policy makers, youth, and government authorities to fix the issue of Climate Finance that will enhance mitigation and adaption actions that will in turn address climate change.” Madam Butler.

In addition to that, Mr. Amara B. Kanneh, a Development Expert and Director of Programs of the Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT), informed the audience about the LYTT Social Media Campaign on Climate Justice that was launched four days ago and encouraged the audience to join the Social Media Campaign and amplify youth voices to effect policy actions and decisions for a just climate transition.

On the part of the Community, Youth Chairlady, Mrs. Rebecca Slocum, lamented on the challenges that the People United Community is faced with; such as: lack of adequate Waste Holding Station, Lack of proper Drainage System at the JFK Hospital which result in over flooding of the People United Community whenever rainfall, Sanding Mining from the Beach, etc.

She furthered appreciated the Liberia Youth Task Team (LYTT) and the Actionaid Liberia (AAL) for partnering to host such an eye-opening and educative program that reminded the resident of People United Community about their role in the fight against Climate Change.

 You see, the EV scam was hastily hatched by far-leftists who are so detached from reality that they actually believe it is possible to just stop using earth-based fossil fuels on some arbitrary timeline with nothing viable to replace them.

Not only that, but ""green"" enthusiasts seem to lack the cognition necessary to see that there is no workable infrastructure in place to even accommodate the use of EVs as a total replacement for cars with internal combustion engines.

""The mass conversion from internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEs) to electric vehicles was never more than a Democrat / environmentalist hallucination anyway,"" says Dr. Ron Ross, PhD.

""It was the most ill-conceived government policy objective in modern history. The transition should have been a nonstarter. It's riddled with numerous deal killers. It's like having a dozen fatal diseases all at the same time.""

(Related: Learn more about why EVs have been a scam from the very beginning.)

In a piece he wrote for the Climate Change Dispatch that was also picked up by Climate Depot, Ross explains at great length what would need to be in place just to create the possibility that a nationwide fleet of 100 percent EVs would work.

For one, energy generation and grid expansion would need to at least double, and very quickly. With the arbitrary deadlines the greenies have put in place, one of the big ones being Agenda 2030, that type of rapid expansion is simply impossible.

There is a reason why there was never any market research or feasibility studies done on the EV transition. Had they been, the results would have shown what we are now all finding out in real time: that EVs are a lost cause.

""The electric vehicle honeymoon is over,"" Ross contends. ""Don't expect the marriage itself to last much longer either.""

Another thing the greenies never considered is the lengthy charging times for EVs. While a gas-powered vehicle can be refilled with gas at any one of the tens of thousands of gas stations that dot the United States landscape, EVs take hours to charge – assuming you can even find a charger.

Someone with an EV who lives in California, for instance, would not even make it through Arizona, let alone all the way through Texas, if they were, say, taking a road trip to Florida.

""Did they truly believe everyone would tolerate spending hours to charge their vehicles rather than the minutes they were accustomed to?"" Ross asks.

Sales data clearly shows that the American public is simply not interested, either due to cost or impracticality, in buying an EV. Heck, even car rental companies are having trouble getting their customers to rent an EV for a day or two, let alone buy one.

Even so, car manufacturers are continuing to ramp up EV production. This means that, in time, there will be EV graveyards full of unsold EVs, resulting in untold billions of dollars in losses and serious economic repercussions.

""We are spending trillions on a fabricated dream, all for imaginary payoffs decades in the future,"" Ross writes.

""When the EV house of cards collapses what will the reaction be? Ordinarily, for normal persons, it should be a time for regret, rethinking, and humility ... It would be good if the Democrat / environmentalist true believers learned something from the EV debacle.""

EN_UA_300069.txt,Other,Other,"Ukraine War Has Boosted Demand for Missile Defenses, Lockheed Says 

 Russia’s attack on Ukraine, including regular barrages of rockets, has boosted demand for Lockheed Martin missile defense systems, the No. 1 U.S. weapons maker said on Tuesday.

“We’ve got demand signals for THAAD and PAC-3 from around the world,” Chief Executive Jim Taiclet said after Lockheed reported a drop in quarterly sales and profits. THAAD and PAC-3 refers to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system and the interceptors for Patriot missile systems.

“Especially when you see missiles hitting hospitals and situations like that, and train stations in Ukraine,” Taiclet said in explaining the demand, adding that governments were now thinking “that it’s worthwhile to have an effective missile defense capacity in your country.”

Lockheed said its quarterly revenue fell while quarterly profits dropped 5.7 percent as supply chain woes triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic were compounded by inflation pressure.

The company reaffirmed its full-year revenue outlook of about $66 billion, which is in line with analysts estimates.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s record peacetime national defense budget request of $813 billion was unveiled in March as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has spurred demand for more military spending globally.

The pandemic crippled many aerospace companies’ ability to procure as well as supply parts needed to produce products, creating shortages, reducing inventories and hammering profits amid a period of rising inflation. Lockheed’s dual-use suppliers that cater to both commercial aviation and defense markets have also been impacted. Taiclet said inflation had hurt the company’s performance.

“The result should bring a focus to defense supply chain concerns, which may be evident elsewhere this quarter as well, though there did not seem to be major issues. In addition, management did not change 2022 guidance and with defense budget support and the war in Ukraine” raising defense spending appetites, temporary challenges could be limited, JP Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said in a note.

Shares in Lockheed were down $5.33, or 1.1 percent, at $462.21 at midday.

Lockheed’s Aeronautics unit, its biggest, which makes F-35 fighter jets saw its revenue rise 2 percent compared to the same quarter a year ago, but profits fell by 2 percent to $697 million.

Lockheed reported 26 F-35 jet deliveries in the quarter compared with 17 a year earlier. Taiclet said Lockheed was working to increase F-35 sales for 2023.

Net earnings fell to $1.73 billion, or $6.44 per share, in the first quarter ended March 27 from $1.84 billion, or $6.56 per share, a year earlier.

Net sales fell about 8 percent to $14.96 billion in the quarter.

 The World Economic Forum in Davos has ordered global authorities to radically reduce the number of white people in the world by 2030.

If you thought the Great Replacement was nothing more than a conspiracy theory, you might want to think again.

According to a WEF report, white people are responsible for the vast majority of the world’s problems including climate change and colonialism, and in the interests of an equitable future for the globe, the number of white people must be reduced as a priority.

The WEF has enlisted the United Nations to help with the plan and the results are already playing out before our eyes.

The Netherlands has become one of the global elite’s testing grounds for the most extreme policies.

Just as the Netherlands was ground zero for the elite’s war on farmers, Dutch cities are also operating as laboratories for the elite’s plans to depopulate the world and radically alter demographics.

Eva Vlaardingerbroek reports from the Netherlands.

What is wrong with our leaders?

They are fully bought and paid for compromised reprobates who have hitched their wagon to the globalist agenda and take their orders directly from Davos.

Catching the elite in “mask off” moments is nothing short of terrifying.

Take for example footage of a top CDC official saying that the elites must “get rid of of all the whites in the United States” and replace them with immigrants to create a more compliant society.

Dr. Carol Baker was describing what she described as the “solution” at a panel discussion in New York City.

You won’t be surprised to hear that Baker was appointed Chair of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization by Barack Obama’s Health and Human Services Secretary in 2009.

She was also honored with the 2019 Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal at a D.C. ceremony sponsored by Pfizer and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Is anyone surprised that a Bill Gates-connected CDC official is openly suggesting depopulating America of white people who don’t cooperate with the elite’s vaccine agenda?

This is the same Bill Gates who told world leaders that it’s time to talk about “death panels” that will sentence ordinary, law-abiding people to death for the crime of being of no use to the elite.

This is the psychopathic world Bill Gates and his associates at the WEF are determined to usher in as part of their Great Reset and Great Replacement.

It gets even worse when you understand how far and wide their evil ideology has spread.

The globalist elite are no longer hiding their plans to depopulate the world by reducing the number of white people. This is a multi-pronged attack and we are now seeing what it looks like in real time.

Of course, the mainstream media are still operating under instructions from the elite to attack anybody who dares to express what they can see with their own two eyes.

They will attack you, shout you down, and pressure your employer to fire you. You might lose your bank account.

You are simply not allowed to talk about the human tragedy of Biden and Harris’ open border, even though Biden is on record laying out his great replacement vision in 2015 in plain English for everybody to understand.

Biden is a compromised puppet politician who has been shamelessly selling out America to the globalists for decades.

Now that he has been sacrificed by the global elite in favor of Kamala Harris and appears to have been replaced by a body double who is approximately eight inches taller than the last version, it is worth pointing out that the elite think we are incredibly stupid.

They really think we are not paying attention to the mountains of evidence proving the multi-pronged attacks maiming and killing the population all have one thing in common.

Chemtrails and mRNA disproportionately target white people in a way that is statistically impossible unless it’s by design.

Of course the plot to depopulate the world has been planned out in detail. The Covid vaccines have long been exposed as a bioweapon designed to cull the herd and depopulate the world.

But it gets even worse, as Robert F. Kennedy explained in New York City. The bioweapon is targeted to take out white people and spare other races.

We can’t allow the evil logic of ethnic bioweapons to become the new normal.

EN_UA_300060.txt,Other,Other,"Trump Predicts the End of US Democracy If He Loses 2024 Election 

 Donald Trump said on Saturday if he does not win November's presidential election it will mean the likely end of American democracy.

The Republican presidential candidate, speaking to supporters in Ohio, made the claim after repeating his baseless assertion that his 2020 election defeat to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of election fraud.

During an outdoor speech that was whipped by strong winds and punctuated by some profane language, Trump predicted that if he does not win the Nov. 5 general election, American democracy will come to an end.

""If we don't win this election, I don't think you're going to have another election in this country,"" Trump said.

Trump, who is under criminal indictment in Georgia for trying to overturn the result of the 2020 election there, this week won enough delegates to mathematically clinch the Republican nomination.

A general election rematch with Biden is likely to be extremely close. A Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two candidates in a statistical tie with registered voters.

Trump opened his remarks in Dayton with a tribute to his supporters who are currently in jail for rioting at the US Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as they sought to block certification of Biden's 2020 election win.

Trump saluted and called them ""patriots"" and ""hostages"".

The former Republican president has been using increasingly dystopian rhetoric in his campaign speeches about the state of the country.

In the middle of a section in his speech about placing tariffs on imported cars, and foreign competition for the US auto industry, Trump declared: ""If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath for the whole country.""

Asked what he meant, his campaign pointed to a post on the social media platform X by a New York Times journalist, which said Trump's ""bloodbath"" comment came amid a discussion about the US auto industry and the economy.

Asked for a response to Trump's ""bloodbath"" comment, Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer condemned Trump's ""extremism"", ""his thirst for revenge"", and his ""threats of political violence"".

Trump also appealed to Blacks and Hispanics, voters who will play a key role in deciding November's election.

Trump has been narrowing the gap with Biden in opinion polls with non-white voters, who formed a core part of Biden's winning coalition when he defeated Trump in 2020.

Trump cited a central campaign theme, that too many illegal immigrants have crossed the US-Mexico border since Biden took office, in his appeal to minority voters.

""No-one has been hurt by Joe Biden's migrant invasion more than our great African American and Hispanic communities,"" Trump said.

 Waste recovery is necessary to reduce the increasing quantity of landfill and other forms of rubbish dumping. Garbage can be transformed into fuel, wood, compost and other materials. Doing this can help to cut contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill use.

Waste recovery is necessary to reduce the increasing quantity of landfill and other forms of rubbish dumping.

Garbage can be transformed into fuel, wood, compost and other materials. Doing this can help to cut contamination, greenhouse gas emissions and landfill use.

The Ljubljana Regional Waste Management Centre (RCERO Ljubljana) is the biggest environmental project in Slovenia, and the most modern facility for waste treatment in Europe.

It is also Slovenia’s biggest cohesion fund environmental project, and a great example of regional cooperation.

Euronews’ Aurora Velez spoke with RCERO Ljubljana’s Founder and Head of Investments and Development, Mjtja Praznik, who created, designed and founded the centre from scratch.

Euronews: How did you come up with the idea for the project?

Mjtja Praznik: Some of the activities started in 2000 when Slovenia was joining the EU: we had to adopt a lot of legislative changes in the field of waste management. Up to that time, most of the municipal waste was thrown into landfill. And this, according to new legislation, needed to stop.

So we thought we needed to treat waste: first, separate it, and then use it for material recycling and energy recovery.

Euronews: What is - according to you- the impact of the project in Slovenia and in Europe?

Mjtja Praznik: Slovenia was treating its municipal waste mainly by landfill, losing all the materials and all the energy. By changing the principle, and by introducing this new treatment for waste, the rate of material being recycled has considerably improved.

We have also replaced some combustibles and energies from the fuel produced in the waste and, last but not least, we have also significantly reduced the amount of waste that is going into landfill. From the new plant, only 2% of the waste goes there: the other 98% is transformed into fuel!

Euronews: How do you feel about having created the project from scratch?

Mjtja Praznik: I am very proud of this project. I had the idea 20 years ago and had started researching the technology then.

I am happy that we were able to use our previous experience from landfill, gas extraction and utilisation. All this knowledge has been key to the project. We have aerobic treatment, anaerobic treatment, mechanical treatment: these are all my babies!

I started with it, and I went through all these phases: preparing, studying, comparing different technologies. And lastly, opting for the finance from the European Commission, because the project was not cheap!

Then it took around three and a half years to get the project ready for operation. I'm happy that it was a long project because it is a big one that can't be done overnight.

EN_CC_100034.txt,Other,Other,"Biden's Climate Bureaucrats Set Their Sights On Americans' Insurance 

 The Treasury Department announced Tuesday that it is moving to amass data from private insurance companies to assess the financial risks of climate change on homeowners across the country.

The department’s Federal Insurance Office (FIO) is proposing a new regulation that will gather homeowners’ and businesses’ data from property and casualty insurers, according to a press release. The FIO will use the data to determine whether private insurance coverage will be disrupted in areas of the nation that are vulnerable to “climate change impacts.”(RELATED: The Fed’s Plan To Battle Inflation Could End Up Making Energy More Expensive. Here’s How)

“FIO’s data collection will add to the work of regulators and policymakers across the Administration to assess climate-related risks to the financial system, the U.S. economy, and the American people,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement provided by the press release.

If the regulation is implemented it would apply to all large property and casualty insurers; however, it would not apply to small insurers with policies worth less than $100 million, with the exception of those in 10 high-risk states as determined by The Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a summary of the proposal. The information would be gathered by ZIP code and would not include information about individual homeowners’ policies but would also request data from five years ago to determine market patterns.

President Joe Biden signed an executive order in May 2021 to direct the FIO to assess the risk that the “climate crisis” poses to private insurance coverage. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a government office of financial regulators, deemed climate change to be an “emerging and increasing threat,” according to an October 2021 report.

“Today’s action by the Federal Insurance Office is an important step in determining how Americans are being affected by the increasing costs of climate change,” Yellen stated.

The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Climate change protesters are hoping to “shut down” the annual Congressional Baseball Game on Wednesday night.

Youth-led activist group Climate Defiance plans to protest at the north gate of Nationals Park and “shut” the game down, Evan Drukker-Schardl, an organizer for the group, told The Hill.

“This game is an important kind of illustration of what’s wrong with our politics and our political elite that’s destroying our planet,” Drukker-Schardl said. “We’re not going to let this celebration of corporate political corruption go unchallenged.”

The organization, established in March 2023, also led a plan to blockade the White House Correspondents’ Dinner nearly two months ago.

EN_CC_200165.txt,CC: Downplaying climate change,CC: Downplaying climate change: Ice is not melting,"“Melting Antarctic” scare narrative exposed as FRAUDULENT: Antarctic ice MORE stable than previously thought 

 by Ethan Huff, Natural News:

Mainstream “news” is littered with scare stories about how global warming has apparently gotten so bad that the Antarctic ice shelves are melting. The truth, though, is that Antarctica’s ice shelves are actually growing in size.

New research published by Andreasen et al. looks at Antarctic-wide satellite data collected between 2009 and 2019. The data was compiled using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, or MODIS.

TRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/

Between the 10-year period analyzed, Andreasen et al. discovered that the Antarctic ice shelf area grew in size by 5305 km2. Eighteen ice shelves did retreated in size somewhat during that time, but 16 others grew larger in terms of their overall area mass.

“Our observations show that Antarctic ice shelves gained 661 Gt of ice mass over the past decade,” the researchers noted in their paper.

(Related: When the next “catastrophe” strikes, climate-related or otherwise, Erie County, N.Y., is ready to impose more lockdowns – only “essential workers” with “movement passes” will be allowed to travel.)

Numerous studies confirm: Antarctic ice is doing just fine

Another study published by Banwell et al. that appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters looked at an even wider range of Antarctic ice data ranging from 1980 through 2021. That study utilized microwave satellite data from the snow model SNOWPACK.

Like the first study, this second one, which was published in 2023, found that the highest meltwater volumes occurred on Antarctica’s Peninsula, reaching a peak in 1992 and 1993, as well as in 1994 and 1995. SNOWPACK calculated “a small, but significant, decreasing trend in both annual melt days and meltwater production volume over the 41 years.”

Another paper published by Frazer et al. in the journal Nature backs these findings even further. This one explains that while dramatic ice losses are occurring in some areas of Antarctica, including in West Antarctica from Pine Island and the Thwaites glaciers, ice projections for the future cannot be accurately made.

This study, which looked at a time period ranging from 2003 through 2015, identified extensive glacial retreat and acceleration along the Bellinghausen Sea coastline. Conversely, things look rather well on the ice front along the Amundsen Sea.

“Our results provide direct observations that the pace, magnitude and extent of ice destabilization around West Antarctica vary by location, with the Amundsen Sea response most sensitive to interdecadal atmosphere-ocean variability,” the authors wrote.

Finally, another paper published by Baico et al., also in 2023, found that over the centuries, Antarctic ice has both thinned and thickened, depending on the time period.

The authors looked at subglacial bedrock cores to discover that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) between the Thwaites and Pope glaciers “was at least 35 m (meters) thinner than present in the past several thousand years and then subsequently thickened.”",EN,['CC: Downplaying climate change'],['CC: Downplaying climate change: Ice is not melting'],melt antarctic scare narrative expose fraudulent antarctic ice stable previously think ethan huff natural news mainstream news litter scare story global warming apparently get bad antarctic ice shelf melt truth antarctica ice shelf actually grow size new research publish andreasen et al look antarctic wide satellite datum collect datum compile moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis truth live https://sgtreport.tv/ -year period analyze andreasen et al discover antarctic ice shelf area grow size km eighteen ice shelf retreat size somewhat time grow large term overall area mass observation antarctic ice shelf gain gt ice mass past decade researcher note paper relate catastrophe strike climate relate erie county n.y ready impose lockdown essential worker movement pass allow travel numerous study confirm antarctic ice fine study publish banwell et al appear journal geophysical research letter look wide range antarctic ice datum range study utilize microwave satellite datum snow model snowpack like study second publish find high meltwater volume occur antarctica peninsula reach peak snowpack calculate small significant decrease trend annual melt day meltwater production volume year paper publish frazer et al journal nature back finding explain dramatic ice loss occur area antarctica include west antarctica pine island thwaite glacier ice projection future accurately study look time period range identify extensive glacial retreat acceleration bellinghausen sea coastline conversely thing look ice amundsen sea result provide direct observation pace magnitude extent ice destabilization west antarctica vary location amundsen sea response sensitive interdecadal atmosphere ocean variability author write finally paper publish baico et al find century antarctic ice thin thicken depend time period author look subglacial bedrock core discover west antarctic ice sheet wais thwaite pope glacier meter thin present past thousand year subsequently thicken
EN_CC_100213.txt,Other,Other,"Feature: Los Angeles marks Indigenous Peoples' Day with celebrations at Getty Center 

Getty Center, one of the top attractions in the U.S. West Coast city of Los Angeles, celebrated the annual Indigenous Peoples' Day over the weekend with an expansive family event aimed at highlighting both traditional and contemporary Indigenous perspectives.

The gathering on Saturday was part of Getty's continuous efforts to celebrate Southern California's vibrant Native American cultures. Sitting atop a hill in the Santa Monica Mountains, the Getty Center, a campus of the Getty Museum and other programs of the Getty Trust, took around 1.3 billion U.S. dollars to build and opened in December 1997. It is well known for its architecture, gardens, and bird's-eye views of Los Angeles.

Building on last year's success, where attendees learned about native plant dyes and relished musical performances, this year's event in the museum had a broader scope.

Generous support for this year's celebration came from the Getty Patron Program, which provides funds for exceptional exhibitions at the museum, reflecting the institution's commitment to diversity and inclusion.

""Los Angeles stands on indigenous land. Recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day is not just about acknowledgment but about understanding, appreciating, and cherishing the cultures that have been here for thousands of years,"" former Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch O'Farrell remarked previously. O'Farrell was the first Native American to serve on the Los Angeles's City Council from 2013 to 2022.

Indigenous Peoples' Day is recognized on the second Monday of October, and its significance has grown over the years as an alternative to Columbus Day.

Rita, a teacher from Compton with Native American ancestry, attended the event with her family. ""It's essential for my children to see their culture celebrated so publicly. This is an educational experience, a cultural revival, and a family day out, all rolled into one.""

All-day activities included a tasting menu curated by culinary anthropologist Claudia Serrato, which offered attendees a chance to savor traditional Mesoamerican flavors like cacao, chia seeds, maíz, and amaranth. Participants also received recipe cards to recreate these delicacies at home.

Luna, inspired by the Alliance of Native American Chefs, attended the tasting event with an eye to learning more ways to develop her own brand of Native American cuisine that fuses her grandmother's cooking with modern flavors.

""I want to celebrate my amazing grandmother, of the Aqua Caliente tribe, who could do wonders with simple traditional ingredients, and encourage others to explore our unique culinary traditions,"" she told Xinhua.

The celebration further comprised a block stamp workshop led by Meztli Projects, where attendees learned about Mexica lifeways using linocut stamps.

""As someone deeply involved in the revival of indigenous arts, this event is a significant step forward,"" stated Carlos Red Feather, an artist from the Pacific Northwest. ""It's not just about the past; it's about the present and future of our art and our communities.""

""I've been attending these celebrations for years, and the shift in narrative is palpable,"" Linda M., a Native American LA resident, told Xinhua. ""We appreciate the efforts of California's leaders to ensure that our voices are heard, our histories acknowledged, and our rights secured.""

The event's broader intent was evident as it also shone light on the pressing challenges faced by Indigenous communities, such as discrimination, disproportionate impacts of climate change, and land rights.

Conversations echoed sentiments expressed by leaders like Alannah Hurley, executive director of United Tribes of Bristol Bay, who emphasized that the community is not merely a historical footnote but remains a crucial and vibrant part of the American fabric.

As the day ended, Mirim S., a student from the University of California, Los Angeles, reflected that ""today was more than a celebration. It was a call to action. We, the younger generation must ensure that the message of diversity and recognition is not confined to a single date but is carried on through our daily lives.""

As Los Angeles and other cities in California and across the United States continue to celebrate Indigenous Peoples' Day, attendees expressed the hope that it would pave the way for greater understanding, recognition and collaboration in the future.

 The conflict in Ukraine may end either by diplomatic or military means. However, it can be possible only after Moscow achieves its goals.

""An opportunity to resolve the conflict will appear only when Ukraine ceases to pose a threat to Russia and discriminate against Russian-speaking Ukrainians,” Vasily Nebenzya, Russia's Ambassador to the UN Security Council, said at a briefing at the UN Security Council.

""If this result can be achieved through negotiations, we are ready for such a scenario. If not, then our objectives will be achieved by military means,"" he added.

Russia is not fighting against the Ukrainian people. Russia is fighting against the criminal nationalist regime that came to power in 2014” after the coup in Kyiv, the diplomat said.

""The new Ukrainian leadership is trying to purge the country of everything connected with Russia and glorify Nazi accomplices. <…>

""The Kyiv regime and its most rabid patrons have forgotten the meaning of the word ""peace."" It is no coincidence that the European Union finances arms supplies to Kyiv through the European Peace Fund, without even thinking about how blasphemous it sounds and looks. <…>

""Ukraine, in fact, has become a NATO PMC. It gets money, weapons and intelligence data. Ukraine receives instructions which targets to attack and where. It is the Ukrainian people who suffer from this in the first place and the people of Ukraine are forced to fight for the sake of someone else's tasks.""

However, the Russian Ambassador to the UN said, everything could have ended differently for Ukraine, if Kyiv had implemented the now-defunct Minsk Agreements that were signed in 2014 and 2015 ""in an attempt to pave the way for peace by granting the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics a special status as part of the Ukrainian state"".

Former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel and ex-president of France Francois Hollande later confirmed that neither sitting President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, nor his predecessors, nor France and Germany, who were involved in the Minks Agreements process, never intended to fulfil them. This diplomatic process served only as a ""smoke screen"" behind which they secretly armed Ukraine against Russia.

Merkel's and Hollande's confessions caused an uproar in Moscow. Russian officials called them a formalisation of betrayal. Interestingly, though, no one in the West was embarrassed about those statements. It appears that the West continues implementing its strategy.

In December, Ukraine put forward the idea of the Global Peace Summit based on Zelensky's ""peace formula."" In that formula, among other things, Zelensky demanded Russia should withdraw its troops from all Ukrainian territories.

Moscow dismissed the plan as it ignored the new status of Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Kherson, Zaporozhye (Zaporizhzhia) regions and Crimea as part of Russia.

Now Kyiv has a new ""idea"":

The Ukrainian administration wants to hold a ""peace summit"" at UN headquarters in New York on February 24 (one year anniversary since the start of the special operation), but without Moscow's participation.

According to The Associated Press, Ukrainian President Zelenskiy was planning to visit New York in February to address a high-level meeting of the 193-member General Assembly on the eve of the first anniversary of Russia's February 24 invasion of Ukraine.

Ukraine would like the UN General Assembly to adopt two resolutions:

""Peace talks could start after the UN General Assembly passes the resolutions or after the proposed summit is held,"" Ukraine's Deputy Foreign Minister Emine Dzhaparova said.

 A report from these two schools says that with the exception of Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast, all other smaller and local airports will need to disappear by 2029 in order for the war on ""global warming"" and ""climate change"" to eventually be won.

Air travelers who require regional transfers to and from the three larger airports after that time will need to take rail or a car instead, as these are considered by the globalists to be much better forms of transport for the climate.

The only way for even Heathrow, Glasgow, and Belfast to remain open between 2029 and 2049 is if all other airports close down by 2029, and if all air transfers within the UK be migrated to ground transfers. If that is achieved, then the Big Three can stay open until 2049.

After that, the report states, all airports, including the Big Three, will need to be closed down permanently, leaving residents trapped right where they are. This, we are told, will ""cool"" down the planet and create a climate utopia.

""In order to meet this legal commitment, the report states that every citizen of the United Kingdom will need to 'stop using aeroplanes' for a significant period of time,"" reported The Exposé about how the scheme is outlined to work.

In order to fully comply with the Climate Change Act, airports are not the only thing that has to go. The same report states that the general public will need to stop flying as well as stop doing anything else that creates ""emissions,"" regardless of the energy source.

Meat consumption, for instance, will also need to end because raising cows for beef and sheep for lamb is bad for the environment, the globalists claim. Genetically modified (GMO) soybeans and corn, on the other hand, which have to be doused in deadly chemicals in order to grow, are good for the environment and can stay.

By 2029, these climate extremists want people in the UK to reduce their meat consumption by 50 percent. The remaining 50 percent will need to be ""phased out"" between 2030 and 2049.

No more new buildings will be allowed after 2049 either. Pretty much anything that falls into the category of economic activity will need to go, which also means that all people – except for the globalists, of course – will also need to disappear in order to stop them from emitting their very existence and polluting the envisioned globalist utopia.

""The underlying point is that any asset which uses carbon will have essentially zero value in 2050,"" the report states. ""This in turn may encourage greater use in the run up to 2050 – for example, putting up new buildings at a much faster rate for the next 30 years, knowing that construction must then halt.""

The report, by the way, was released in 2019 just prior to covid. In many ways, it serves as a blueprint for what is still to come, which is being catalyzed by the global upheaval that was foisted upon the world in the name of fighting the ""pandemic.""

""It is possible that the events of the past two and half years are part of a larger, more sinister agenda that is only just beginning,"" is how The Expose puts it.

 A top French politician has claimed that a large part of Western aid to Kiev is being embezzled by Ukrainian officials, despite President Zelensky’s assurances that it is being used in the fight against Russia.

Florian Philippot, leader of the Patriots (Les Patriotes) party and a long-time critic of Western assistance to Ukraine has alleged that Zelensky was lying when he claimed that all US aid to his country “goes to the battlefield.”

In a social media post on Friday he wrote: “In reality a large part is diverted and goes into corruption!”

RT reports: He noted Kiev’s admission last month that it had not received €16 billion ($17.1 billion) in aid collected by Poland and the European Commission. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal claimed he had “no idea” what happened to the funds.

Philippot also pointed to a recent corruption scandal involving Ukrainian Agriculture Minister Nikolay Solsky, who is accused of illegally appropriating state land worth nearly €6.9 million ($7.4 million). “Yet another case of corruption in this country, which is one of the most corrupt on the planet!” the French politician remarked.

“Every euro sent to Ukraine prolongs the war and therefore causes unnecessary deaths, impoverishes us here, and has a strong chance of enriching the corrupt!” he added, calling for the conflict to be resolved as soon as possible.

Ukraine has been plagued by widespread graft for years, and a 2015 Guardian article described it as “the most corrupt nation in Europe.” More recently, it ranked 104 out of 180 countries in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index.

The issue has taken center stage during the conflict with Russia, including in the Ukrainian military, which has been rocked by several graft scandals in recent months. This winter, Ukraine’s SBU, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB, announced that it had uncovered a major embezzlement scheme in which Ukrainian officials and private contractors stole around $40 million earmarked for shell procurement.

Elsewhere, the Pentagon’s inspector general admitted that Washington had failed to properly track more than $1 billion in weapons sent to Ukraine, although this did not stop US officials from claiming that they believed the assistance to have reached its intended destination.

Russia, meanwhile, has for months been warning about the spillover of foreign weapons sent to Ukraine, cautioning that they are ending up in the hands of organized crime outside of the country.",EN,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities']",french party leader claim large ukraine aid steal french politician claim large western aid kiev embezzle ukrainian official despite president zelensky assurance fight russia florian philippot leader patriot les patriote party long time critic western assistance ukraine allege zelensky lie claim aid country go battlefield social media post friday write reality large divert go corruption rt report note kiev admission month receive billion billion aid collect poland european commission ukrainian prime minister denis shmigal claim idea happen fund philippot point recent corruption scandal involve ukrainian agriculture minister nikolay solsky accuse illegally appropriate state land worth nearly million million case corruption country corrupt planet french politician remark euro send ukraine prolong war cause unnecessary death impoverish strong chance enrich corrupt add call conflict resolve soon possible ukraine plague widespread graft year guardian article describe corrupt nation europe recently rank country transparency international corruption perception index issue take center stage conflict russia include ukrainian military rock graft scandal recent month winter ukraine sbu successor soviet era kgb announce uncover major embezzlement scheme ukrainian official private contractor steal million earmark shell procurement pentagon inspector general admit washington fail properly track billion weapon send ukraine stop official claim believe assistance reach intended destination russia month warn spillover foreign weapon send ukraine caution end hand organize crime outside country

 The declaration document, received by ANTARA in Nusa Dua, Bali, on Wednesday, stated that several G20 leaders agreed on a number of issues, including the importance of upholding international law and the multilateral system as well as handling the economic crisis through global macro-policies.

They also agreed to make efforts to ensure food and energy security and adopt digital technology to boost innovation.

G20 state leaders also called for a collective commitment to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), address climate change, and strengthen the health sector.

Lastly, G20 members expressed their appreciation of the Indonesian presidency for putting together a number of priority issues and coordinating international cooperation between member countries, invitee countries, as well as regional and international organizations.

At the G20 Summit’s opening session in Bali on Tuesday (November 15), President Joko Widodo had stressed that the discussions at the summit must not fail to lead to a conclusion that is beneficial for the global community.

The dialogues between countries, who represent 80 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), at the Bali G20 Leaders' Summit should be successful in producing concrete and useful outcomes for the world, he added.

He further said that the international community is paying close attention to the G20 Summit to determine whether it will end in success or failure.

The summit, which was held in the resort island of Bali and was attended by a majority of G20 heads of government, should be a success rather than a failure, he added.

After officially closing the summit on Wednesday, Indonesia handed over the G20 presidency to India.

EN_CC_100156.txt,Other,Other,"Continual growth: 58 villages now utilizing renewables to grow their economies 

 total of 58 villages across the archipelago are harnessing renewable energy to stimulate economic and social activities in their communities through the Village Energy Independence (DEB) program under Pertamina’s Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (CSER) umbrella.

The DEB program has expanded as of September to another 11 sites, six of these powered through solar power plants (SPPs) that were installed in collaboration with Pertamina New & Renewable Energy (PNRE), a subsidiary that specializes in new and renewable energy.

The six new DEB locations are: Singapure village in Lahat regency, South Sumatra; Tambakharjo subdistrict in Semarang, Central Java; Eka Jaya subdistrict in Jambi province; Tasikharjo district in Tuban regency, East Java; Larangan village in Cirebon, West Java; and Adat Kedonganan village in Badung, Bali. In addition to infrastructure development, the DEB program also empowers communities in accelerating energy equity by utilizing local energy sources to deliver power to remote villages.

Pertamina vice president corporate communication Fadjar Djoko Santoso said Pertamina would continue to provide access to renewables for all Indonesians so they ultimately achieved energy and economic self-reliance.

""We are continuing our journey to provide opportunities and accelerate the energy transition for the public, such as through the DEB program, which can be beneficial in stimulating economic activity,"" Fadjar said.

Tasikharjo village is one tangible example of Pertamina’s support for local economies through the DEB program. The village is using solar energy to power local micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), such as Batik Sekar Tanjung, Jahit Sekar Tanjung and Ethical Creative Tasikharjo.

Meanwhile, Tambakharjo subdistrict is using solar photovoltaic (PV) panels to power the activities of the Pujasera Energy Culinary Kampung.

Solar energy is also being harnessed to support a variety of activities in Kedonganan village that impact the region’s community-based economy, including the operation of its reduce, reuse, recycle waste management facility (TPS3R).

Solar PV panels is also used to generate renewable energy in the villages of Eka Jaya, Larangan and Singapure to support the activities of aquaponics, aquaculture and agriculture MSMEs, including a coffee farm, as well as other MSMEs that stimulate economic and social development.

""The use of renewable and environmentally friendly energy, which never runs out, greatly enhances the productivity of coffee bean processing and other business production, early childhood schools and other public institutions, such as Posyandu [integrated health services posts],” said Singapure village head Aristo Hasan.

“This improves the quality of life for residents of Singapure village and also broadens our understanding of environmentally friendly, renewable energy that can help the government mitigate climate change,"" Aristo added.

Since Pertamina launched the DEB program in 2019, the program has generated benefits that include 170,880 watt-peak (Wp) of solar energy, 605,000 cubic meters per year of biogas and methane, 8,000 Wp of microhydropower, 6,500 liters of biodiesel per year and 16,500 Wp of solar-wind hybrid energy.

In addition to its energy impact, the DEB program has also positively impacted 3,201 households, contributing to an estimate of Rp 1.8 billion in added value per year through overall multiplier effect. The program has also contributed to reducing carbon emissions by 565,928 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) per year.

As part of Pertamina’s CSER initiative, the DEB program supports the company's environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) principles. The program is also in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in achieving SDG 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 13 on Climate Action.

Moreover, the DEB program is a concrete action Pertamina is taking to contribute to the government's 2060 net zero emissions goal.

 Ontario farmer speaks out against the Trudeau Liberals' carbon tax

On April Fools’ Day, the Justin Trudeau Liberals authored a very bad joke. Namely, the much-hated carbon tax spiked yet again. These vile virtue-signalers are hellbent on “saving the planet” while they force more Canadians into bankruptcy.

Not that Liberal members of Parliament are fretting over this fiscal kick to the crotch, mind you. Because on that very same day the carbon tax increased, MPs benefited from a 4% pay raise. Must be nice. But if this is some sort of April Fools’ Day joke, we’re still searching for the punchline.

Protests regarding the carbon tax increase erupted across our great dominion last Monday, including one in Uxbridge, Ont., where dozens of farmers assembled outside an arena. Can you blame them? The Grain Farmers of Ontario (GFO) estimate that by 2030, Ontario grain and oilseed farmers alone will pay a staggering $2.7 billion in carbon taxes.

Rebel News journalist David Menzies (@TheMenzoid) reports from Uxbridge, Ont. as farmers take to the streets in opposition to the Trudeau Liberals' carbon tax increase.— Rebel News (@RebelNewsOnline) April 4, 2024

One of the farmers demonstrating in Uxbridge was Ted Eng, 71. He lamented that too many farmers are in a money-losing position now thanks to rising costs and labour rates. And increasing the tax threshold is akin to tossing gasoline on a bonfire.

Ted noted that if he were to sell his farm today, it would likely go for about $4 million. He’d be able to pocket the windfall and comfortably retire. But he doesn’t want to. He loves the land. He loves farming. He believes he’s going to die on his farm.

Canadians should be grateful that there are farmers like Ted Eng. Their efforts produce the food that ends up in supermarkets. If farmers are taxed out of existence, then goodbye food security as our meat and potatoes would have to be imported from other nations that have governments that are more farm friendly.

Check out our interview with Ted Eng, who has much to say about the sorry state of farming these days… not that the Trudeau Liberals give a rodent’s rectum.

 The Biden administration celebrated praise from a far-left climate alarmist group known for harassing public officials and blocking roads on Saturday.

Following its Friday announcement that it’s pulling the plug on several liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in the name of so-called “climate change,” the White House released a “WHAT THEY ARE SAYING” press release the following day that included remarks from left-wing climate activists and organizations celebrating the administration’s continued war on efficient sources of energy and the American consumer. [emphasis, links added]

Among the groups propped up by the administration is Climate Defiance, a radical environmentalist group comprised of young Marxists who regularly disrupt traffic and shout down U.S. politicians to coerce them into advancing their radical agenda.

According to InfluenceWatch, much of the organization’s funding comes from the Climate Emergency Fund (CEF), a nonprofit “that channels money to groups engaged in climate activism.”

CEF has previously received funding from “former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s Onward Together, liberal activist Abigail Disney, and oil heiress Aileen Getty’s Aileen Getty Foundation.”

In its Saturday release, the White House specifically highlighted Climate Defiance’s Jan. 26 tweet celebrating the administration’s “monumental” decision to ax the aforementioned LNG projects.

“Never thought we would see the day. The White House is amplifying our Twitter account. Words fail. Words fail. Words utterly fail,” Climate Defiance’s X account posted on Sunday.

— Climate Defiance (@ClimateDefiance) January 28, 2024

Beyond funding from Democrat-aligned entities, Climate Defiance is more well-known for its goal of “making life MISERABLE for every person in power” who opts not to endorse its extreme agenda.

Earlier this month, for example, several of the group’s members “swarmed” Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., while he was speaking at a New Hampshire diner.

Climate Defiance agitators chanted “anti-fossil fuels slogans” during Manchin’s remarks. One of them, carrying a sign “calling for the end of fossil fuel dependence,” reportedly jumped in front of the senator’s SUV as it was departing the venue.

The group claimed Manchin uses his position as chair of the Senate Energy Committee to “protect his personal coal company.”

Climate Defiance’s radical behavior doesn’t stop there.

Since its 2023 launch, the group has attempted to corner several high-ranking Democrats, including President Joe Biden.

According to InfluenceWatch, on April 29, its members “created a blockade to prevent elected officials from attending the White House Correspondents’ Dinner at the Washington Hilton, hoping to see [the president] and demand an end to leasing public lands for fossil fuel projects.”

The organization’s members harassed Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., at a book launch event in May and “blocked traffic and protested outside” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s New York City residence later that same month.

Climate Defiance demonstrators were also reportedly removed from a June event hosted by the Detroit Free Press, at which Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm was scheduled to speak.

Among the phrases shouted by agitators were, “No MVP. No LNG. Granholm, you are killing me,” and, “F-ck you, Jennifer. F-ck you, Joe Biden. F-ck all these politicians.”

 Judging from statements that a number of Western officials have made lately, one shall assume that there will be no compromises in the proxy war between the Russian Federation and the West.

On January 16, speaking at the meeting with heads of municipalities of Russian regions, President Putin said that Ukrainian statehood was on the verge of destruction:

""If this continues, then Ukrainian statehood may suffer an irreparable and very serious blow. This is their area of responsibility — this is the outcome of their policy and rule,” Putin said.

At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in Davos that the conflict would need to escalate.

""Moscow has bluffed before with its threats. On the contrary, we need to escalate now because Putin understands only the language of force. If Russia's defeat leads to the collapse of the Putin regime, Europe may become safer and the world — freer and more democratic,"" Zelensky said.

Polish President Andrzej Duda supported Zelensky in Davos:

""The war will end when we force the Russians out of all the occupied territories. This is obvious to me.""

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, answering a question about a truce, noted in Davos that he did not see any conditions for a ceasefire.

""When you're going through hell, keep going.""

Winning the conflict is an existential question for all parties. The United States is the main instigator of the conflict with Russia in Ukraine. Today, it is the US that emerges as the main obstacle on the way to a ceasefire and then peace.

If the US agreed to sign an agreement with Russia, it would be tantamount to stopping NATO's expansion to the east and thus ending the dream of US global domination and exceptionalism. The United States will be clinging to every opportunity to keep and regain geopolitical advantage. Otherwise, the US financial system based on the dominance of the dollar will crumble. That would be lethal to Washington and the US will continue using Ukraine as a bargaining chip in fierce competition with Russia.

This suggests that hostilities in Ukraine will continue indefinitely until one of the parties is completely crushed and destroyed. Therefore, Russia has no other choice but to force the Kyiv regime to capitulate.

At the same time, due to internal contradictions in the United States, there is no funding for Kyiv. Ukraine needs $5 billion a month. Without this money, Ukraine is bankrupt, including at the front. Ukraine's manpower has been exhausted, let alone its production potential.

Russia has been developing its defence industry by leaps and bounds lately.

According to Stratfor, if there is a ceasefire agreement, it will be concluded on Russia's terms. Maintaining Russia's control over Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions will neutralise Ukraine and prevent its entry into the European Union and NATO in the coming years, Stratfor analysts believe. It is not clear what borders Ukraine presently has. Moreover, Kyiv's formal control over territories does not coincide with reality.

Time will be working for Russia as it continues to develop its defence industry, increase the strength of its army and find ways to circumvent sanctions.

Russia's victory in the conflict in Ukraine would deal a terrible blow to the image of the United States. There is no more ""as long as it takes"" — it has been replaced with ""as long as we can"", Stratfor concludes.

The outcome of the special military operation in Ukraine will become clear to everyone in four to six months.

 German bosses, unions jointly oppose boycott of Russian gas

Germany’s employers and unions have joined together in opposing an immediate European Union ban on natural gas imports from Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, saying such a move would lead to factory shutdowns and the loss of jobs in the bloc’s largest economy.

“A rapid gas embargo would lead to loss of production, shutdowns, a further de-industrialization and the long-term loss of work positions in Germany,” said Rainer Dulger, chairman of the BDA employer’s group, and Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the DGB trade union confederation, in a joint statement Monday on Germany’s dpa news agency.

The statement comes as European leaders are discussing possible new energy sanctions against Russian oil, following a decision April 7 to ban Russian coal imports beginning in August. Ukraine’s leaders say revenues from Russia’s energy exports are financing Moscow’s destructive war on Ukraine and must be ended.

That won’t be easy to do. The EU’s 27 nations get around 40% of their natural gas from Russia and around 25% of their oil. Natural gas would be the most difficult do without, energy analysts say, since most of it comes by pipeline from Russia and supplies of liquefied gas, which can be ordered by ship, are limited amid strong demand worldwide.

Germany, a major manufacturing hub and an importer of Russian gas, has so far resisted an immediate shut-off and said it plans to instead phase out Russian oil by the end of the year and most Russian gas imports by mid-2024. The EU’s executive commission has outlined steps to cut the consumption of Russian gas by two-thirds by year’s end through using more pipeline gas from Norway and Azerbaijan, importing more liqueifed gas, accelerating the deployment of wind and solar projects and intensifying conservation efforts.

German Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck said in an interview with the Funke media group that “an immediate gas embargo would endanger social peace in Germany.”

Despite widespread economic sanctions against Russian banks and individuals, the EU continues to send around $850 million a day to Russia for oil and gas, even as EU governments condemn the war in Ukraine. Gas-intensive companies include producers of glass, metals, ceramics and chemicals. Industry officials say in many cases natural gas would be impossible to replace in the short run.

Analysts say Russian crude oil would be easier to replace than gas but that a boycott would still lead to higher energy prices that would hit consumers who are already facing record EU inflation of 7.5%.",EN,['URW: Negative Consequences for the West'],['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Sanctions imposed by Western countries will backfire'],german boss union jointly oppose boycott russian gas german boss union jointly oppose boycott russian gas germany employer union join oppose immediate european union ban natural gas import russia invasion ukraine say lead factory shutdown loss job bloc large economy rapid gas embargo lead loss production shutdown de industrialization long term loss work position germany say rainer dulger chairman bda employer group reiner hoffmann chairman dgb trade union confederation joint statement monday germany dpa news agency statement come european leader discuss possible new energy sanction russian oil follow decision april ban russian coal import begin august ukraine leader revenue russia energy export finance moscow destructive war ukraine end win easy eu nation natural gas russia oil natural gas difficult energy analyst come pipeline russia supply liquefy gas order ship limit amid strong demand worldwide germany major manufacturing hub importer russian gas far resist immediate shut say plan instead phase russian oil end year russian gas import mid- eu executive commission outline step cut consumption russian gas third year end pipeline gas norway azerbaijan import liqueifed gas accelerate deployment wind solar project intensify conservation effort german vice chancellor robert habeck say interview funke medium group immediate gas embargo endanger social peace germany despite widespread economic sanction russian bank individual eu continue send million day russia oil gas eu government condemn war ukraine gas intensive company include producer glass metal ceramic chemical industry official case natural gas impossible replace short run analyst russian crude oil easy replace gas boycott lead high energy price hit consumer face record eu inflation

 by Frank Bergman, Slay News:

The Danish government has introduced radical new laws that will tax livestock farmers for “emissions” from cows, pigs, and sheep to supposedly “fight global warming.”

Demark has become the first country in the world to introduce a carbon tax that seeks to force farmers to comply with the goals of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) “Net Zero” agenda.

The Scandinavian nation will tax farmers for the so-called “greenhouse gases” allegedly emitted by their livestock from 2030.


Denmark’s globalist leaders claim they are targeting a major source of methane emissions, which they allege is one of the most potent gases contributing to “global warming.”

In order to comply with the WEF’s “Net Zero” targets, Taxation Minister Jeppe Bruus said the aim is to reduce Danish “greenhouse gas emissions” by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030.

As of 2030, Danish livestock farmers will be taxed $43 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2030.

The tax will increase to $108 by 2035.

However, because of an income tax deduction of 60%, the actual cost per ton will start at $17.3 and increase to $28 by 2035.

Although carbon dioxide is typically blamed for causing “climate change,” globalists claim that methane traps about 87 times more heat on a 20-year timescale.

However, as Slay News has previously reported, top scientists have debunked these claims as a hoax.

A recent peer-reviewed study provided conclusive scientific evidence proving that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Earth’s atmosphere cannot cause “global warming.”

Dr. Jan Kubicki led a group of world-renowned Polish scientists to study the impact of increases in CO2 emissions on the Earth’s global temperatures.

However, not only did they find that higher levels of CO2 made no difference, but they also proved that it simply isn’t possible for increases in carbon dioxide to cause temperatures to rise.

Kubicki and his team recently published three papers which all conclude that Earth’s atmosphere is already “saturated” with carbon dioxide.

This saturation means that, even at greatly increased levels of CO2, the “greenhouse gas” will not cause temperatures to rise.

Nevertheless, unelected globalists at the United Nations Environment Program claim that livestock accounts for about 32% of “human-caused methane emissions.”

“We will take a big step closer in becoming climate neutral in 2045,” Bruus said.",EN,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Methodologies/metrics used are unreliable/faulty', 'CC: Questioning the measurements and science: Greenhouse effect/carbon dioxide do not drive climate change', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",denmark punish farmer cow emission fight global warming frank bergman slay news danish government introduce radical new law tax livestock farmer emission cow pig sheep supposedly fight global warming demark country world introduce carbon tax seek force farmer comply goal world economic forum wef net zero agenda scandinavian nation tax farmer call greenhouse gas allegedly emit livestock denmark globalist leader claim target major source methane emission allege potent gas contribute global warming order comply wef net zero target taxation minister jeppe bruus say aim reduce danish greenhouse gas emission level danish livestock farmer tax ton carbon dioxide equivalent tax increase income tax deduction actual cost ton start increase carbon dioxide typically blame cause climate change globalist claim methane trap time heat -year timescale slay news previously report scientist debunk claim hoax recent peer review study provide conclusive scientific evidence prove carbon dioxide co emission earth atmosphere cause global warming dr jan kubicki lead group world renowne polish scientist study impact increase co emission earth global temperature find high level co difference prove simply isn possible increase carbon dioxide cause temperature rise kubicki team recently publish paper conclude earth atmosphere saturate carbon dioxide saturation mean greatly increase level co greenhouse gas cause temperature rise unelected globalist united nations environment program claim livestock account human cause methane emission big step close climate neutral bruus say

 FACT CHECK: Viral X Image Purporting To Show Greta Thunberg Holding Anti-Semitic Book Is Digitally Altered

A viral image shared on X, formerly Twitter, purports to show 20-year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book.

— I,Hypocrite (@lporiginalg) November 28, 2023

Verdict: False

The image is digitally altered. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.” A spokesperson for Thunberg confirmed the image was fake in an email to Check Your Fact.

Fact Check:

Thunberg has been criticized for chanting “crush Zionism” at a recent pro-Palestine rally in Sweden, according to the Times of Israel. Nigel Savage, founder of the Jewish non-profit Hazon, said Thunberg and other members of the political left “have been intellectually captured by a naive, distorted and frankly bigoted anti-Zionism,” the outlet reported.

The X image, viewed over 800,000 times, purports to show Thunberg holding an anti-Semitic book. “On The Jews And Their Lies,” the title of the book appears to read. The book is supposedly written by German priest and theologian Martin Luther.

The image is digitally altered, however. In the original image, shared via Thunberg’s verified X account, she can be seen holding a copy of “The Climate Book.”

“I’m so pleased to share that The Climate Book is now available in the USA and Canada! I have gathered the wisdom of over one hundred contributors to highlight the many different crises we face and equip us with the knowledge we need to avoid a climate disaster,” Thunberg wrote in the first of two posts promoting the book.

“This is the biggest story in the world, and it must be spoken as far and wide as our voices can carry and much further still. Thank you for your support!

I will not earn money from this book as my copyright belongs to the Greta Thunberg Foundation, so all royalties go to charity,” she added in the second post.

Likewise, Check Your Fact did not find the digitally altered X image in any recent credible news reports about Thunberg. In addition, a keyword search reveals that “On The Jews And Their Lies” is in fact an anti-Semitic work authored by Luther.

 Scientists claim 10 per cent heavier rains due to climate change caused Wayanad landslides


The devastating landslides which struck Kerala's Wayanad were triggered by incessant rainfall which was 10 per cent more intense due to climate change, according to a new study by the scientists from the World Weather Attribution (WWA) group.

The region recorded more than 140 mm of rain in a single day on highly soaked soils due to monsoon rainfall for two months. This triggered devastating landslides and floods claiming at least 231 lives in Wayanad, the researchers said.

""The rainfall that triggered the landslides occurred in a region of Wayanad that has the highest landslide risk in the state. Even heavier downpours are expected as the climate warms, which underscores the urgency to prepare for similar landslides in northern Kerala,"" said Maja Vahlberg, a climate risk consultant at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre.

The team of 24 scientists from India, the US, the UK, and Sweden examined climate models with high resolutions to reflect the rainfall activity in the Wayanad region for calculating the influence of humans on climate change.

The models suggest that climate change caused a 10 per cent increase in the intensity of the rainfall, they said. The models also forecast a further four per cent increase in the intensity of rainfall if there is a rise in the world's average temperature by two degrees Celsius.

However, a ""high level of uncertainty"" revolves around the research model as the region of study is small and mountainous with complicated dynamics of rainfall and climate.

According to scientists, events of this severity are likely to become more common in India and the rest of the world as the climate becomes warmer and warmer. In warmer temperatures air carries more moisture which leads to such heavy downpours in a single day.

Wayanad landslide was the third most intense in the state of Kerala since the Indian weather department started keeping records in 1901.

 Russia will win the special operation in Ukraine if the society shows consolidation and composure to the enemy, President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to the Ulan-Ude Aviation Plant on March 14, Rossiya 24 TV channel said.

Russia is not improving its geopolitical position in Ukraine. Instead, Russia is fighting ""for the survival of Russian statehood, for the future development of the country and our children.""

""In order to bring peace and stability closer, we, of course, need to show the consolidation and composure of our society. When the enemy sees that our society is strong, internally braced up, consolidated, then, without any doubt we will come to reach what we are striving for — both success and victory,"" Putin said.

According to him, many of the current problems began after the collapse of the Soviet Union, when they tried to put pressure on Russia to ""destabilise the internal political situation.” ""Hordes of international terrorists"" new sent to the purpose to accomplish this goal, Putin said.

Afterwards, the West decided to start rehabilitating Nazism in Russia's neighbouring states, including in Ukraine.

Nevertheless, Putin continued, Russia had long tried to build partnerships with both Western countries and Ukraine. However, after 2014, when the West contributed to the coup in Ukraine, the state of affairs changed dramatically. It was then when they started exterminating those who advocated the development of normal relations with Russia, he said.

According to Putin, Russia was forced to launch the special operation to protect the population. Western countries were hoping to break Russia quickly, but they were wrong, he said adding that Russia managed to raise its economic sovereignty since 2022.

EN_UA_000104.txt,Other,Other,"Senate blocks sanctions aimed at stopping Nord Stream 2 pipeline 

 The Senate blocked a measure to impose new sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany after the Biden administration warned it could disrupt allied unity in the confrontation over Ukraine.

The measure by Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas failed on a vote of 55 to 44. It needed 60 votes to pass.

The vote was held open for several hours as Democrats grappled with a setback on unrelated voting rights legislation.

“Russia has nakedly and unequivocally used energy as energy blackmail,” Cruz said Thursday on the Senate floor. President Vladimir Putin has done that “openly, brazenly and laughingly and absolutely nothing happened,” Cruz said.

Opponents of the measure said it would damage U.S. cooperation with Germany and other NATO partners as they try to head off a potential invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s forces deployed on its borders.

The bill “would undermine the current diplomatic situation,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who had introduced earlier sanctions proposals with Cruz. “We are in a very different situation right now” than when two earlier bills were passed.

The Biden administration also has argued that imposing new sanctions on the undersea pipeline now could undercut the US’s ability to persuade other European nations to join in severe economic penalties later if Russia invades Ukraine.

The legislation “will not counter further Russian aggression or protect Ukraine,” Emily Horne, a spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “Instead, it will undermine our efforts to deter Russia and remove leverage the United States and our allies and partners possess in this moment all to score political points at home.”

The White House backed an alternative plan from Senator Bob Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, that would make the sanctions contingent on Russia’s actions in Ukraine. Nearly 40 senators have signed on to that bill.

But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the pipeline is what’s divisive. Unlike an older Nord Stream pipeline, the new one bypasses Ukraine.

“The government of Germany should have shelved this project itself a long time ago,” McConnell said. “These sanctions, like the prior Nord Stream 2 sanctions that had overwhelming bipartisan support here in Congress, are not about driving a wedge in Europe. The pipeline itself is the wedge.”

McConnell called for a stronger stance against Russia, saying on the Senate floor that the US should extend additional humanitarian and military support to Ukraine.

“We must not pull our punches out of some fear of provoking Putin,” he said. “What will encourage Putin is if he senses American weakness.”

Construction of the new pipeline is essentially complete, but Germany has yet to issue the certification required for it to begin operating.

""Quanto mais quente está o oceano, mais energia está disponível para a atmosfera poder desenvolver estas depressões muito cavadas com impactos significativos."" E como ""o oceano é muito lento"", as consequências a prolongam-se no tempo.

Portugal tem “condições físicas para que as tempestades aumentem de frequência e amplitude”. A tempestade Ciarán, que chegou à Europa como um ciclone-bomba, não é a primeira do género a abater-se sobre o solo português, mas é provável que fenómenos destes se tornem mais frequentes. De resto, o fim de semana deve trazer outra tempestade, que até já tem nome - Domingos.

O geofísico e ex-presidente do Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) Miguel Miranda alerta, em declarações à CNN Portugal, para a dimensão das tempestades em causa. “É muito interessante do ponto de vista físico mas muito alarmante do ponto de vista social”, sublinha, notando que nos países mais afetados, como França, registaram-se ventos de 200 km/h, um valor altamente significativo e que é extremamente raro em solo europeu.

Miguel Miranda explica que, sobretudo devido ao aquecimento global - que vai provocar um aquecimento dos oceanos -, é natural que fenómenos destes ocorram com maior frequência e intensidade. “Quanto mais quente está o oceano, mais energia está disponível para a atmosfera poder desenvolver estas depressões muito cavadas com impactos significativos nas construções e nas pessoas”, acrescenta o geofísico.

E, apesar de o pior já ter passado, é de esperar que ainda se notem vários efeitos nos próximos dias, pelo menos até ao fim de semana. Isto porque “o oceano é muito lento”, o que leva as consequências a prolongarem-se no tempo, mesmo depois da passagem do sistema que provoca a tempestade.

“Isso leva a restrições na costa, até porque existe uma segunda tempestade oceânica este fim de semana que vai tornar mais difícil a vida nas comunidades litorais”, vinca Miguel Miranda.

O especialista pede, por isso, que as pessoas cumpram à risca as recomendações do IPMA, que emitiu um aviso vermelho para grande parte do litoral, deixando ainda um aviso laranja em toda a costa pelo menos.

“É importante que se perceba que vamos ter um novo máximo na agitação marítima. Quando se indica uma ondulação de oito metros de altura, isso quer dizer que 10% das ondas podem ter mais de 16 metros. Quando existe um aviso vermelho emitido pelo IPMA é para ser cumprido estritamente porque os perigos que existem são muitos”, reitera Miguel Miranda.

Sobre os efeitos que estes ciclones-bomba podem provocar, Miguel Miranda diz que “os portugueses têm alguma experiência de tornados, sistemas de outra dimensão”, mas alerta para os impactos que o vento e a chuva podem ter, sobretudo nas zonas mais perto da costeira. Basta ver o que aconteceu em 1941, quando os registos do IPMA assinalaram o primeiro ciclone-bomba em solo nacional.

""Quando os ventos atingem velocidades desta grandeza levantam objetos, destroem árvores. A ação combinada do vento e da chuva é muito impactante - as árvores de grande porte que caem nas zonas urbanas são capazes de destruir habitações e veículos"", conclui o geofísico.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",eis notícia ciclone-bomba ciarán Portugal condição físico tempestade aumentar frequência amplitude quente oceano energia disponível atmosfera desenvolver depressão cavado impacto significativo oceano lento consequência prolongam se Portugal condição físico tempestade aumentar frequência amplitude tempestade ciarán chegar europa ciclone-bomba género abater se solo português provável fenómeno de este tornar frequente resto semana trazer tempestade nome domingo geofísico ex-presidente instituto português mar atmosfera ipma Miguel Miranda alerto declaração cnn Portugal dimensão tempestade causa interessante vista físico alarmante vista social sublinhar notar país afetado França registaramr se vento km/h altamente significativo extremamente raro solo europeu Miguel Miranda explicar sobretudo devido aquecimento global provocar aquecimento oceano natural fenómeno de este ocorr frequência intensidade quente oceano energia disponível atmosfera desenvolver depressão cavado impacto significativo construção pessoa acrescentar geofísico apesar mau passar esperar notir efeito próximo dia semana oceano lento levar consequência prolongarem se passagem provocar tempestade levar restrição costa existir tempestade oceânico semana tornar difícil vida comunidade litoral vincar Miguel Miranda especialista pedir pessoa cumpr risca recomendação ipma emitir aviso vermelho litoral deixar aviso laranja costa importante perceber ir agitação marítimo indicar ondulação metro altura onda metro existir aviso vermelho emitir ipma cumprir estritamente perigo existir reiterar Miguel Miranda efeito ciclones-bomba provocar Miguel Miranda português algum experiência tornado sistema dimensão alertar impacto vento chuva sobretudo zona costeira bastar acontecer registo ipma assinalar ciclone-bomba solo nacional vento atingir velocidade grandeza levantar objeto destroemer árvore ação combinar vento chuva impactante árvore porte cair zona urbano capaz destruir habitação veículo concluir geofísico

Mas só daqui a 250 milhões de anos

Há anos que os especialistas alertam a humanidade para o impacto do aquecimento global: conforme sobem as temperaturas, há uma preocupação com o abastecimento alimentar mundial, com a subida do nível do mar e com o facto de as regiões da Terra se tornarem demasiado quentes para se viver.

Agora, num estudo publicado na revista ‘Nature Geoscience’, os cientistas previram o momento em que a humanidade assistirá ao acontecimento da “extinção tripla” que acabará com os seres humanos e o que a causará.

O estudo, liderado pela Universidade de Bristol (Reino Unido), indica que a Terra poderá tornar-se um supercontinente quente, seco e em grande parte inabitável, com toda a massa terrestre a fundir-se num terreno gigante – foram utilizados para a pesquisa os primeiros modelos climáticos de supercomputadores de um futuro distante e mostrou que o mundo terá mais erupções vulcânicas que emitirão enormes plumas de dióxido de carbono, aumentando ainda mais a temperatura.

O Sol poderá tornar-se mais quente e mais brilhante no céu, aquecendo a Terra mais do que nunca e fazendo com que a temperatura média se situe entre os 40 e os 50 graus Celsius.

De acordo com Alexandrer Farnsworth, principal autor do estudo e investigador associado sénior da Universidade de Bristol, “o supercontinente recém-emergido criaria efetivamente um triplo golpe, compreendendo o efeito de continentalidade, um Sol mais quente e mais CO2 na atmosfera, aumentando o calor em grande parte do planeta”.

O resultado é um ambiente hostil, sem fontes de alimento e água para os mamíferos. Temperaturas generalizadas entre 40 e 50 graus Celsius e extremos diários ainda maiores, agravados pela elevada humidade, acabariam por selar o nosso destino.

Os seres humanos — juntamente com muitas outras espécies — morreriam devido à sua incapacidade de libertar este calor através do suor, arrefecendo os seus corpos.

Segundo o estudo, mesmo que a humanidade deixasse de utilizar combustíveis fósseis, isso não impediria a extinção. Mesmo que a humanidade sobreviva até ao evento, haverá uma extinção total. A única vantagem é que o evento está a 250 milhões de anos de distância.

Eunice Lo, coautora do estudo e investigadora em Alterações Climáticas e Saúde na Universidade de Bristol, afirmou que “é de importância vital não perder de vista a nossa atual crise climática, que resulta das emissões humanas de gases com efeito de estufa”.

“Embora estejamos a prever um planeta inabitável dentro de 250 milhões de anos, hoje em dia já estamos a sentir um calor extremo que é prejudicial para a saúde humana. É por isso que é crucial atingir emissões líquidas nulas o mais rapidamente possível”, concluiu.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Whatever we do it is already too late']",humanidade enfrentar triplo extinção erradicar vida terra de aqui milhão ano haver ano especialista alertar humanidade impacto aquecimento global conforme subir temperatura haver preocupação abastecimento alimentar mundial subida mar facto região terra tornar demasiado quente viver estudo publicar revista nature geoscience cientista previr humanidade assistir acontecimento extinção triplo acabar ser humano causar estudo liderar universidade bristol reino unir indicar terra tornar se supercontinente quente seco inabitável massa terrestre fundir se terreno gigante utilizar pesquisa primeiro modelo climático supercomputador futuro distante mostrar mundo ter erupção vulcânico emitir enorme pluma dióxido carbono aumentar temperatura sol tornar se quente brilhante céu aquecer terra fazer temperatura médio situar grau celsius acordo alexandrer farnsworth principal autor estudo investigador associar sénior universidade bristol supercontinente recém-emergir criar efetivamente triplo golpe compreender efeito continentalidade sol quente co atmosfera aumentar calor planeta resultado ambiente hostil fonte alimento água mamífero temperatura generalizado grau celsius extremo diário grande agravar elevar humidade acabar selar destino ser humanos juntamente muito espécie morrer devido incapacidade libertar calor suor arrefecer corpo estudo humanidade deixar utilizar combustível fóssil impedir extinção humanidade sobrevivo evento haver extinção total único vantagem evento milhão ano distância eunice lo coautora estudo investigador alteração climática saúde universidade bristol afirmar importância vital perder vista atual crise climático resultar emissão humano gase efeito estufa estejamos prever planeta inabitável milhão ano hoje dia estar sentir calor extremo prejudicial saúde humano crucial atingir emissão líquer nula rapidamente concluir

A insinuação feita na segunda-feira (26) pelo presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, de que os aliados da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) poderiam enviar tropas para a Ucrânia ainda está a ter repercussões entre os líderes europeus e norte-americanos.

Esta quarta-feira (28), Berlim fez questão de deixar claro mais uma vez que não vai enviar tropas para o território ucraniano e que não pretende expandir o conflito.

""A NATO não é nem tornar-se-á parte no conflito. Isto continuará a ser o caso. Não queremos que a guerra da Rússia com a Ucrânia se transforme numa guerra entre a Rússia e a NATO. Estamos unidos a todos os nossos aliados. Isto também significa: nenhum envolvimento alemão na guerra! E posso dizer sem rodeios, como chanceler federal, que não enviarei soldados das Forças Armadas alemãs para a Ucrânia!"", disse o chanceler Olaf Scholz num vídeo publicado sobre o assunto na sua conta no X (antigo Twitter).

Também hoje Washington voltou a pronunciar-se sobre o envio de tropas através do porta-voz do Departamento de Estado, Matthew Miller.

Quando questionado por um correspondente da Sputnik sobre o assunto, Miller disse que ""as outras nações decidirão o que desejam fazer. Mas em nome dos Estados Unidos, o presidente [Joe Biden] deixou claro que não haverá presença militar americana em solo"", afirmou.

Para a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova, os aliados da França não compreenderam nem apoiaram a ideia do presidente francês.

""Esta mesma declaração chocou os seus aliados da NATO. Logo, algumas horas depois, foi feita uma série de declarações pelos dirigentes dos países da NATO, […] desassociando-se desta declaração de Macron. Que eles próprios não planeiam nada disto, não planeiam enviar ninguém e entendem que esta já será uma história diferente"", afirmou.

Ontem (27) o porta-voz da presidência russa, Dmitry Peskov, disse que se as tropas forem enviadas, ""teremos de falar não sobre a probabilidade, mas sobre a inevitabilidade de um confronto direto entre a Rússia e a NATO"".

O ex-Presidente russo, Dmitry Medvedev, disse que a adesão da Ucrânia à NATO seria uma declaração de guerra contra Moscovo e que só a ""prudência"" em nome da aliança poderia evitar que o planeta fosse despedaçado.

Os líderes da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte comprometeram-se, na sua cimeira da semana passada, a apoiar a Ucrânia num ""caminho irreversível para a plena integração euro-atlântica, incluindo a adesão à NATO"", mas deixaram em aberto quando é que essa adesão poderá acontecer.

Medvedev, vice-presidente do Conselho de Segurança da Rússia e uma voz de liderança entre os falcões do Kremlin, disse ao meio de comunicação Argumenty I Fakty que a adesão da Ucrânia iria além de uma ameaça direta à segurança de Moscovo.

""Isto, no fundo, seria uma declaração de guerra – embora com atraso"", disse em comentários publicados na quarta-feira.

""As ações que os opositores da Rússia têm tomado contra nós durante anos, expandindo a aliança, levam a NATO a um ponto de não retorno"".

Numa linha padrão do Kremlin desde a invasão em grande escala da Ucrânia por Moscovo em 2022, Medvedev disse que a Rússia não ameaçava a NATO, mas responderia às tentativas da aliança de promover os seus interesses.

""Quanto mais tentativas deste tipo existirem, mais duras se tornarão as nossas respostas"", disse Medvedev. ""Se isto irá despedaçar o planeta inteiro depende unicamente da prudência do lado (da NATO).""

PT_338.txt,Other,Other,"Espírito Santo entra em “estado de alerta” devido à falta de chuvas

No Estado do Espírito Santo a falta de chuvas trouxe grande preocupação aos agricultores e às autoridades responsáveis ​​pela gestão da água. A Agência Estadual de Recursos Hídricos (Agerh) emitiu um decreto de estado de alerta devido à severa escassez de água, particularmente prejudicial para a agricultura.

Segundo Fábio Ahnert, presidente executivo da Agerh, as alterações climáticas, acentuadas pelo El Niño, têm provocado um período de seca prolongada, algo atípico para o Estado. A situação é ainda mais crítica no norte do Espírito Santo do que na região da Grande Vitória.

O decreto estabelece medidas restritivas urgentes, como a proibição imediata da perfuração de poços tubulares, a menos que seja comprovadamente para uso humano. Além disso, reduziu-se significativamente o volume diário permitido para a captação de água nas licenças de utilização dos recursos hídricos no Estado.

Estas medidas incluem uma redução de 20% no volume diário autorizado para rega, 25% para captações destinadas à indústria e agroindústria, e 35% para outros fins, excluindo usos não consumitivos.

Os agricultores foram aconselhados a priorizar o período noturno para a rega das culturas, além de adotarem práticas que visem a redução do consumo de água. No entanto, são permitidas algumas exceções, como a irrigação limitada de olericulturas em áreas restritas por propriedade e culturas específicas em estufas com sistemas de irrigação adequados.

Os agricultores e empresários do setor estão a enfrentar um desafio significativo face a esta escassez hídrica, tendo de se adaptar e adotar práticas que visem o uso racional da água para minimizar os impactos na produção agrícola do estado.

Baba Vanga é uma personalidade conhecida do público que, mesmo depois da sua morte, em 1996, tem vindo a ser tema de conversa por todo o mundo.

Em causa estão as previsões que 'deixou' para os anos que ainda aí vêm, e, apesar de ainda estarmos a meio de 2024, as previsões para o próximo ano são já conhecidas - e não trazem dias melhores.

Segundo as publicações internacionais, Vangelia Gushterova - mais conhecida por Baba Vanga - sugeriu que o começo do fim da Humanidade estava 'marcado' para o final de 2025, e, segundo o que se escreve, a Europa estará 'na mira'.

A vidente búlgara terá profetizado que um evento devastador vai ter lugar no continente europeu, e que, na sua sequência, a população vai ser irremediavelmente afetada.

Mas as previsões deixadas por esta mulher, que é também conhecida por 'Nostradamus dos Balcãs' - numa referência a um astrólogo francês - não são melhores com o passar dos anos. Para 2028, a mulher previu que a exploração espacial fosse ainda mais além, e que os humanos se aproximassem ainda mais do Sol, com a exploração do planeta Vénus.

Já para 2033, Baba Vanga falou na subida do nível das águas do mar, em resultado do degelo - algo que não é desconhecido do público, considerando os alertas dados pelos especialistas que têm vindo a estudar as alterações climáticas.

As previsões que a imprensa internacional traz dão ainda conta de outros eventos, que se estendem até ao ano de 5079, que será quando o fim de tudo vai chegar - com, até à chegada do apocalipse, ideologias partidárias a espalharem-se pelo mundo, a haver contacto com vida extraterreste ou mesmo a Terra a tornar-se inabitável.

O plenário da Câmara dos Deputados aprovou, ao início da noite desta quarta-feira (8), um projeto de lei que exclui a silvicultura — como a monocultura de eucalipto e pinheiro — do elenco de atividades poluentes.

Na prática, isto permite que estas monoculturas estejam isentas de pagamento de taxa de controlo e fiscalização ambiental por atividades potencialmente poluentes. Esta verba é direcionada para o Ibama (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis), para que o organismo possa atuar no controlo e fiscalização destas atividades potencialmente poluidoras e utilizadoras de recursos naturais.

Esta quarta-feira, registaram-se 309 votos a favor, 131 contra e 2 abstenções. As federações PT-PC do B-PV e do PSOL-Rede, além do PSB, orientaram contra o texto. O governo de Lula (PT) libertou a sua bancada. Agora, o texto seguirá para sanção presidencial.

A aprovação do projeto contou com o apoio de parlamentares da bancada ruralista, uma das mais expressivas da Câmara. Os deputados dos partidos da esquerda, por sua vez, teceram duras críticas ao projeto.

O deputado Patrus Ananias (PT-MG) disse que é um projeto ""agressivo à natureza e ao ambiente"" e criticou a rapidez com que a matéria foi discutida na Câmara — no dia anterior, os parlamentares aprovaram o requerimento de urgência do texto , que dá mais celeridade à tramitação na Casa.

""Sei que o eucalipto traz alguns benefícios económicos, mas tem de ser normalizado. Onde está o eucalipto é o chamado deserto verde, ali não prolifera nenhuma planta, nenhum animal. É uma temeridade o que está aqui a acontecer: a urgência foi aprovada ontem e hoje estamos a votar o projeto. A quem interessa do ponto de vista económico esta agilidade?"", disse Ananias.

A deputada Fernanda Melchionna (PSOL-RS) criticou a votação do projeto, afirmando que traz prejuízos para o ambiente. Ela citou, ainda, a tragédia climática no Rio Grande do Sul.

""Numa crise que não é um desastre, é uma catástrofe ambiental provocada por uma lógica de devastação permanente, que é a tónica de muitos neste parlamento"", afirmou.

""Somos contra o projeto, sobretudo numa altura em que o Rio Grande do Sul sofre a maior catástrofe resultante não de catástrofes naturais, mas do desastre ambiental provocado pela forma de exploração. Aprovar um projeto destes, que coloca a criação de grande escala de eucaliptos e pinheiros como a atividades isentas de potencial destrutivo, é um absurdo"", acrescentou o deputado Jorge Solla (PT-BA).

Os parlamentares da oposição afirmaram que é inadequado considerar a silvicultura uma atividade potencialmente poluente.

O deputado Ricardo Salles (PL-SP), ex-ministro do Ambiente do governo de Jair Bolsonaro, disse que os parlamentares que criticaram a matéria não têm ""a informação correta"" sobre a silvicultura.

O deputado Domingos Sávio (PL-MG) disse que há ignorância, desconhecimento e demagogia dos parlamentares que se opõem ao projeto.

""Ser contra a silvicultura é ser contra a plantação de florestas. Quando se planta florestas, evita-se a desflorestação das florestas autóctones, das madeiras que, de facto, precisam de ser preservadas. Porque é preciso madeira, ela faz parte da vida das pessoas. E a madeira que vem da silvicultura evita a desflorestação e ajuda, inclusive, a diminuir o aquecimento global"", disse.

A concentração de gases com efeito de estufa voltou a bater todos os recordes em 2023 e, nas últimas duas décadas, os níveis de dióxido de carbono (CO2), o principal gás com efeito de estufa, aumentaram 11,4%, apontou um novo relatório publicado pela Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) esta segunda-feira (28). Segundo a ONU, isto “condena o planeta a muitos anos de aumento das temperaturas”.

De acordo com o relatório anual sobre a concentração destes gases, que a agência da ONU publica duas semanas antes do início da COP29 em Baku, foram atingidos, no ano passado, níveis de dióxido de carbono de 420 partes por milhão, o que representa um aumento de 151% em relação à era pré-industrial (antes de 1750).

Além disso, foram medidas 1934 partes por mil milhões de metano e 336,9 partes por mil milhões de óxido nitroso, os outros dois gases causadores do aquecimento global, com níveis que representam aumentos em comparação com a era pré-industrial de 265% e 125%, respetivamente.

""Mais um ano, outro recorde. Isto deveria disparar todos os alarmes entre os decisores políticos. Não há dúvida de que estamos muito longe de cumprir o objetivo do Acordo de Paris de manter o aquecimento global bem abaixo de 2 graus em relação aos níveis pré-industriais"", enfatizou a secretária-geral da OMM, a argentina Celeste Saulo, ao apresentar os dados.

O dióxido de carbono, que se estima contribuir com 64% para o aquecimento global e provém principalmente da queima de combustíveis fósseis e da produção de cimento, aumentou em 2023 para 2,3 partes por milhão, em comparação com 2022, um valor superior ao do ano anterior, embora inferior aos três anos anteriores.

Sétimo ano com mais emissões por incêndios desde 2003

Este aumento foi influenciado pela transição do fenómeno La Niña para El Niño (este último ligado ao aumento das temperaturas no Oceano Pacífico) e pela desastrosa época de incêndios, cujas emissões de CO2 foram 16% superiores à média dos anos anteriores, com grandes incêndios florestais em países como o Canadá ou a Austrália.

Já o metano e o óxido nitroso, gerados por causas naturais e também antropogénicas - como a agricultura, a pecuária ou a queima de biomassa - registaram aumentos de concentração mais baixos do que em 2022, de acordo com o relatório da OMM.

A última vez que se registou na Terra uma concentração de dióxido de carbono comparável à atual foi entre três e cinco milhões de anos atrás, quando a temperatura estava entre 2 e 3 graus mais quente e o nível do mar entre 10 e 20 centímetros mais alto.

A agência meteorológica da ONU alerta que, mesmo que as emissões fossem reduzidas rapidamente para atingir um nível líquido zero, seriam necessárias décadas para reduzir os atuais níveis de temperatura.

Um fenómeno que pode acelerar

A OMM alerta também para o risco de o aumento das concentrações dos gases causadores do aquecimento global se tornar cada vez mais intenso. “Os incêndios florestais poderiam libertar mais emissões de carbono para a atmosfera, enquanto o aumento da temperatura dos oceanos poderia reduzir a sua capacidade de absorção de CO2, podendo acumular-se na atmosfera e acelerar o aquecimento global”, observou o secretário-geral adjunto da OMM, Ko Barrett.

Colectivo acusa a “indústria da celulose” de ter responsabilidades nos incêndios e nas sete mortes desta semana. Manifestantes foram detidas e empresa vai apresentar queixa-crime.

Duas integrantes do colectivo Climáximo atiraram esta sexta-feira tinta vermelha contra a sede da Navigator, em Lisboa, acusando a empresa de fabrico de papel de ter responsabilidades nos incêndios florestais e nas mortes que deles resultaram.

As duas pessoas sentaram-se depois em frente à entrada, na Av. Fontes Pereira de Melo, e foram posteriormente detidas pela PSP, segundo confirmou uma fonte desta força policial ao PÚBLICO, pela prática de crime de dano.

Uma fonte oficial da Navigator afirmou ao PÚBLICO que “repudia veementemente este e todos os actos de vandalismo” e que “apresentará uma queixa-crime contra os responsáveis por este acto de vandalismo​”.

Em comunicado do Climáximo, a manifestante Alice Gato, de 22 anos, declarou que “as sete mortes desta semana” nos incêndios que assolaram o Centro e Norte de Portugal “são o resultado directo de uma ofensiva coordenada entre o Estado, a indústria da celulose e a indústria fóssil para transformar o interior do nosso país numa câmara de incineração

Esta é a segunda vez nesta semana que o Climáximo visa as instalações da Navigator. Na terça-feira, membros do grupo tinham colado cartazes nas portas da empresa, acusando-a de “responsabilidade acrescida nas mortes” durante os incêndios.

“No Verão mais quente desde que há registo, os actuais planos dos Governos e das empresas como a Navigator, de aumentar as emissões de gases de efeito de estufa e de continuar a vender o interior do nosso país à indústria do papel, são um crime violento”, argumenta o colectivo climático.

PT_84.txt,URW: Discrediting Ukraine,URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other,"Zelensky planeia segunda cimeira de paz em novembro e diz que Rússia deve participar

O presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelensky, afirmou esta segunda-feira que pretende ter um plano pronto em novembro para permitir a Kiev realizar uma segunda cimeira internacional sobre a sua visão de paz para o conflito no país, acrescentando que devem participar representantes da Rússia.

A Ucrânia recebeu delegações de 92 países numa primeira cimeira na Suíça, no mês passado, para apresentar o seu projeto de paz. A Rússia, que invadiu a Ucrânia, em fevereiro de 2022, não foi convidada para o evento e afastou a sua relevância.

""Estabeleci um objetivo de que, em novembro, teremos um plano totalmente pronto"", disse Zelensky numa conferência de imprensa em Kiev. ""Penso que os representantes da Rússia deveriam estar presentes na segunda cimeira"".

Zelensky fez as declarações após regressar de uma visita a Washington para uma cimeira da aliança militar ocidental Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO), na semana passada.

As autoridades ucranianas já tinham dito anteriormente que os representantes russos poderiam ser convidados para uma nova cimeira.

O vice-ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo disse, na semana passada, que Moscovo não participaria numa nova cimeira. O Kremlin foi menos categórico e disse que não havia ""nenhuma substância precisa"" em relação à ideia de uma segunda cimeira.

A primeira cimeira discutiu três dos 10 pontos apresentados pela Ucrânia como a ""fórmula"" de paz de Zelensky, incluindo a segurança alimentar, a segurança nuclear e a libertação de prisioneiros de guerra e crianças.

As autoridades ucranianas disseram que a segunda cimeira iria discutir um plano elaborado antecipadamente por dezenas de países divididos em grupos de trabalho.

Zelensky disse que as autoridades provavelmente se reunirão no Qatar, no final de julho ou início de agosto, para definir uma posição sobre a segurança energética. Uma reunião sobre segurança alimentar deverá ter lugar na Turquia, em agosto, e outra no Canadá, em setembro, sobre prisioneiros de guerra e crianças, disse.

Um oficial do Exército ucraniano rendeu-se na linha da frente da região de Zaporozhie, desertou para o lado russo e entregou dados sobre o posto de comando e as posições das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia, disse à Sputnik Vladimir Rogov, o copresidente do Conselho Coordenador para a Integração das Novas Regiões.

Na segunda-feira (14), Rogov informou que as Forças Armadas russas na zona de Stepnogorsk, região de Zaporozhie, avançaram e tomaram novas posições na aldeia de Kamenskoe.

""Um caso ilustrativo ocorreu na direção de Stepnogorsk a partir da linha da frente de Zaporozhie. Aí, um oficial das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia passou voluntariamente para o lado pacífico, não querendo mais lutar pelo regime de Zelensky"", disse Rogov.

Segundo o mesmo, o oficial militar ucraniano indicou, ainda, a localização do centro de comando dos militares da Ucrânia e as suas posições, após o qual foram atacados.

Como observou Rogov, cada vez mais ucranianos começam a compreender que ""o regime de Zelensky é um corpo estranho e mortal"" para a Ucrânia, do qual se devem livrar o mais rapidamente possível.

Kamenskoe e Stepnogorsk são povoações na região de Zaporozhie. A estrada que passa por estas povoações abre caminho para a cidade de Zaporozhie. Stepnogorsk está atualmente sob ocupação das tropas ucranianas e há combates em Kamenskoe.

A região de Zaporozhie passou a fazer parte da Rússia após um referendo em setembro de 2022. Kiev não reconhece os seus resultados e continua a bombardear o território.

Atualmente, mais de 70% da região está sob controlo russo, e o restante, incluindo a cidade de Zaporozhie, é mantido pelas tropas ucranianas. Desde março de 2023, a cidade de Melitopol tornou-se temporariamente o centro administrativo da parte da região libertada pelo Exército russo.

As autoridades russas acusaram, esta quarta-feira, a Ucrânia de estar a preparar um ataque com armas químicas com o apoio da NATO, procurando colocar, em última análise, a culpa em Moscovo.

“Temos informações confiáveis de que, com o apoio ocidental, a Ucrânia planeia encenar uma série de provocações anti-Rússia que envolvem o uso de armas químicas na zona de operação militar especial”, acusou a embaixada da Rússia nos Estados Unidos, em comunicado, citado pela revista ‘Newsweek’. “Os preparativos do regime de Kiev e dos seus curadores estão em andamento para fabricar evidências para acusar a Rússia de violações da CWC [Convenção sobre Armas Químicas] durante operações de combate”, acrescentou o comunicado.

Segundo a embaixada russa, em preparação para o suposto ataque, os “países da NATO entregaram mais de 70 dispositivos avançados de deteção e registo de produtos químicos tóxicos à Ucrânia entre julho e setembro de 2024, incluindo os mais recentes detetores e analisadores de gás”. Mais: “as forças de segurança ucranianas foram treinadas tanto na Ucrânia como em centros da NATO em métodos de falsificação de evidências”, enquanto “os países da NATO, em parte através do Secretariado Técnico da OPAQ [Organização para a Proibição de Armas Químicas], estão a ajudar a Ucrânia a construir um ‘corpo de evidências’ para acusar ainda mais a Rússia de violações da CWC”.

A OPAQ indicou à publicação uma declaração emitida em maio pelo seu porta-voz, salientando que “vem monitorizando a situação no território da Ucrânia, desde o início da guerra, em fevereiro de 2022, em relação às alegações de uso de produtos químicos tóxicos como armas”. “Tanto a Federação Russa quanto a Ucrânia acusaram-se uma à outra e relataram alegações de uso de armas químicas à Organização”, disse o porta-voz da OPAQ.

No entanto, a Rússia salientou que “o Ocidente coletivo criou uma atmosfera de impunidade que encoraja o regime de Kiev à medida que ele prossegue perpetrando crimes de larga escala, incluindo o uso de produtos químicos tóxicos”, referindo que tem partilhado regularmente “informações detalhadas” com a OPAQ e o Conselho de Segurança da ONU sobre “o uso em massa de agentes químicos de guerra pela Ucrânia, violando os seus compromissos sob a CWC, bem como provocações encenadas por Kiev e pelos seus apoiantes ocidentais para acusar falsamente as Forças Armadas Russas de ações semelhantes”.

“Pedimos a Washington que pare de ceder cinicamente às provocações de Kiev em nome de um desejo ilusório de infligir uma ‘derrota estratégica’ à Rússia”, disse a embaixada russa. “Em vez de patrocinar os fantoches ucranianos que estão a contorcer-se em agonia, a administração americana deveria considerar criticamente o que está a acontecer e os possíveis riscos que emanam do ‘terrorismo químico’ ucraniano.”",PT,"['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities']",Rússia acusar ucrânia preparar ataque químico apoiar nato autoridade russo acusar quarta-feira ucrânia preparar ataque arma químico nato procurar colocar último análise culpa Moscovo informação confiável ocidental ucrânia planear encenar série provocação anti-rússia envolver uso arma químico zona operação militar especial acusar embaixada Rússia Estados Unidos comunicar citar revista newsweek preparativo regime kiev curador andamento fabricar evidência acusar rússia violação cwc convenção arma químico durante operação combate acrescentar comunicado embaixada russo preparação suposto ataque país nato entregar dispositivo avançar deteção registo produto químico tóxico ucrânia julho setembro incluir recente detetor analisador gás força segurança ucraniano treinar ucrânia centro nato método falsificação evidência país nato secretariado técnico opaq organização proibição arma químico ajudar ucrânia construir corpo evidência acusar Rússia violação cwc opaq indicar publicação declaração emitir maio porta-voz salientar monitorizar situação território ucrânia início guerra fevereiro alegação uso produto químico tóxico arma federação russo ucrânia acusaramr se relatar alegação uso arma químico organização dizer porta-voz opaq entanto Rússia salientar ocidente coletivo criar atmosfera impunidade encoraja regime kiev medida prosseguir perpetrar crime larga escala incluir uso produto químico tóxico referir partilhar regularmente informação detalhadas opaq segurança onu uso massa agente químico guerra ucrânia violar compromisso cwc provocação encenar kiev apoiante ocidental acusar falsamente força armar russa ação semelhante pedir Washington pare ceder cinicamente provocação kiev nome desejo ilusório infligir derrota estratégico Rússia dizer embaixada russo patrocinar fantoche ucraniano contorcer se agonia administração americano dever considerar criticamente acontecer possível risco emanar terrorismo químico ucraniano

A Polícia Rodoviária Federal (PRF) constatou o aumento das interdições nas estradas federais por causa de eventos climáticos nos últimos anos. As ocorrências envolvem deslizamentos de terras, encostas e rochas e inundações. Os números de 2024 já se aproximam do total do ano passado.

Os dados foram divulgados pela PRF o seu site pela Semana Nacional do Ambiente, que começou na segunda-feira (3) e seguiu até sexta-feira (7). O levantamento revelou o crescimento das ocorrências provocadas por fenómenos relacionados com o ambiente.

Em 2024, os bloqueios devido a fenómenos da natureza são a segunda maior causa de interrupção do trânsito de veículos nas estradas nacionais. Nos primeiros cinco meses deste ano, o índice de troços de estradas nacionais interditas já se aproxima do total de interrupções feitas no ano passado. Este ano foram 278, contra 374 em 2023.

O maior número de estradas nacionais cortadas, nos últimos sete anos, ocorreu em 2022, quando foram registados 486 bloqueios. A estatística é quase oito vezes superior à de 2018, quando foram identificadas 61 interdições.

As interrupções das estradas federais provocadas por desastres naturais podem ser reflexo das alterações climáticas e dos eventos extremos que atingem o Brasil, como no Rio Grande do Sul. No estado, a PRF registou, desde o início das fortes chuvas, 159 bloqueios provocados por deslizamentos de terras de terra e inundações.

Entre as principais causas de corte de trânsito nas estradas nacionais estão os acidentes, as manifestações com encerramento de via e a interrupção do trânsito para a remoção de veículos. Nos últimos anos, entretanto, tem crescido o número de vias encerradas por eventos climáticos.

Fiscalização ambiental

A Polícia Rodoviária Federal atua no combate aos crimes ambientais em todo o Brasil em apoio ao Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renováveis (Ibama), ao Ministério Público do Trabalho (MPT) e a outras instituições. Um dos principais focos da PRF é a repressão do transporte ilegal de madeira extraída criminosamente. A desflorestação ilegal é apontada pelos especialistas como uma das principais causas das alterações climáticas que levam ao assoreamento de rios, inundações, erosões e deslizamentos de terras e encostas que provocam interdições de BRs por razões de segurança.

Em 2023, a PRF registou a maior quantidade de madeira apreendida desde 2017. Comparativamente, o índice é mais de quatro vezes superior. As detenções de suspeitos da prática de crimes ambientais também tiveram um aumento de mais de cinco vezes.

Detidos por crimes ambientais

Para além do combate à extração e transporte ilegais de madeira, a PRF mantém ações permanentes na área ambiental, como a formação dos polícias rodoviários e operações temáticas e específicas, que envolvem o combate ao tráfico de animais selvagens e exóticos, à poluição e à ocupação irregular das terras indígenas na Amazónia.

Pelo menos onze drones ucranianos chegaram esta quarta-feira a Moscovo, onde foram abatidos pela defesa antiaérea russa, e mais de 30 outros equipamentos foram destruídos em várias regiões. O ataque com drones contra a capital da Rússia foi considerado pelo Kremlin como um dos maiores desde o início da invasão na Ucrânia, segundo avançou esta manhã a agência Reuters.

O ataque surge numa altura em que, além dos combates na linha da frente no leste da Ucrânia, os dois lados estão agora a combater também na região russa de Kursk, a partir da qual as forças ucranianas invadiram o território russo no dia 6 de agosto. Ao longo da invasão russa, a Ucrânia tem focado o seu uso de drones contra infraestruturas energéticas russas, como refinarias ou aeroportos, procurando prejudicar o fornecimento de energia e de armamento para a frente de guerra.

Contudo, ataques diretos contra Moscovo têm sido mais raros, com as regiões mais próximas da fronteira com a Ucrânia a serem atingidas com maior frequência.

O ministério da Defesa russo, citado pela Reuters, explicou que foram abatidos 45 drones ucranianos durante a madrugada, incluindo onze drones sobre a região de Moscovo, 23 na região fronteiriça de Bryansk, seis sobre Belgorod, três sobre Kaluga e outros dois sobre Kursk.

Os ataques limitaram a atividade dos três aeroportos de Moscovo durante quatro horas, mas o serviço foi reposto pelas 3h30 desta quarta-feira, explicou a autoridade de aviação russa.

O autarca de Moscovo, Sergey Sobyanin, explicou que alguns dos drones foram abatidos antes de chegarem à capital, através das defesas instaladas na cidade de Podolsk, a quase 40 quilómetros a sul. “Esta foi uma das maiores tentativas de atacar Moscovo com drones de sempre”, acusou Sobyanin, numa mensagem publicada esta madrugada na rede social Telegram, elogiando a defesa antiaérea do país.

Até ao momento, não foram registadas quaisquer vítimas ou estragos provocados pelos drones ou pela queda dos equipamentos em Moscovo.

As autoridades do Kremlin também partilharam alguns vídeos nas redes sociais, de drones a serem abatidos sobre os céus de Moscovo, com as bolas de fogo a pintarem momentaneamente a noite. Contudo, a Reuters avisou que estes vídeos não foram verificados por entidades independentes.

O último grande ataque que a Ucrânia lançou sobre a capital russa com recurso a drones ocorreu há mais de um ano, em maio de 2023, quando pelo menos oito veículos aéreos não-tripulados chegaram a Moscovo antes de serem abatidos. Na altura, o ataque provocou alguns estragos, mas serviu principalmente para Kiev mostrar que tem capacidade militar para atacar diretamente a principal cidade da Rússia, localizada a 840 quilómetros da fronteira ucraniana.",PT,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",kiev atacar moscovo capital russo resistir ataque dezena drone ucranianos drones ucraniano chegar quarta-feira Moscovo abater defesa antiaérea russo equipamento destruír várias região ataque drone capital Rússia considerar kremlin grande início invasão ucrânia avançar manhã agência reuter ataque surgir altura combate linha frente leste ucrânia lado combater região russo kursk força ucraniano invadir território russo dia agosto longo invasão russo ucrânia focar uso drones infraestrutura energética russo refinaria aeroporto procurar prejudicar fornecimento energia armamento frente guerra ataque direto moscovo ser raro região próximo fronteira ucrânia ser atingir frequência ministério defesa russo citar reuter explicar abater drone ucranianos durante madrugada incluir drones região Moscovo região fronteiriço bryansk belgorod kaluga kursk ataque limitar atividade aeroporto moscovo durante hora serviço reposto quarta-feira explicar autoridade aviação russo autarca Moscovo sergey sobyanin explicar drone abatir chegar capital defesa instalar cidade podolsk quase quilómetro Sul grande tentativa atacar moscovo drones acusar sobyanin mensagem publicar madrugada rede social telegr elogiar defesa antiaéreo país registar qualquer vítima estrago provocar drone queda equipamento Moscovo autoridade kremlin partilhar vídeo rede social drone ser abater céu Moscovo bola fogo pintar momentaneamente noite reuter avisar vídeo verificar entidade independente ataque ucrânia lançar capital russo recurso drone ocorrer haver ano maio veículo aéreo não-tripulado chegar moscovo ser abater altura ataque provocar estrago servir principalmente kiev mostrar capacidade militar atacar diretamente principal cidade Rússia localizar quilómetro fronteira ucraniano
PT_137.txt,CC: Downplaying climate change,CC: Downplaying climate change: Other,"O radicalismo 'Nice to meet you' do trumpismo

A convenção republicana aqui em Milwaukee reúne as autoridades do partido e delegados de todos os Estados e territórios americanos. Poucos integram de sectores mais pobres da população. São na sua maioria homens brancos de fato com bonés trumpistas. Havia pouca diversidade na plateia. O ambiente era festivo. Não presenciei hostilidade. Muitas das pautas são legítimas. Mas é assustador o radicalismo noutros momentos de pessoas com aquele sorriso simpático do “Nice to meet you” (prazer em conhecer).

No seu discurso, Donald Trump voltou a utilizar um slogan já famoso na atual campanha. “Drill baby, drill!” (Perfure, baby, perfure), gritavam. Esta frase em inglês indica que a prospecção de petróleo deverá ser uma das prioridades do republicano caso vença as eleições, ignorando os avisos sobre os riscos da utilização desta energia poluente numa altura de agravamento das alterações climáticas.

A imigração é outro ponto que chama a atenção quando Trump utiliza termos como “invasão” para descrever o movimento migratório para os EUA a partir da fronteira com o México. Os imigrantes, que incluem muitas famílias com crianças, são classificados como criminosos pelo ex-presidente. Os seus eleitores vibram, gritam “build the wall” (constrói o muro) e exibem placas com os dizeres “mass deportation” (deportação em massa).

Os armamentos são também um tema sempre forte entre os trumpistas. Na convenção, havia uma série de t-shirts com slogans sobre o direito de possuir e de transportar armas. Uma ironia, já que as armas são proibidas na convenção, a não ser nas mãos da polícia e do serviço secreto. Mais grave, Trump quase foi morto por um jovem de 20 anos que teve acesso a uma espingarda AR15 e mesmo assim não mudou de opinião.

Chega a ser surreal ver algumas mulheres e homens sorridentes e simpáticos transformarem-se ao defenderem políticas radicais. Lembrei-me de quando entrevistei no passado colonos israelitas e radicais palestinianos. Falam com simpatia absurdos como se fossem normais.

O presidente de Moçambique participou no primeiro dia de intervenções de Alto Nível da Assembleia Geral da ONU falando de paz e segurança, combate ao terrorismo, alterações climáticas, transição energética, economia azul e conservação ambiental.

Filipe Nyusi iniciou a sua intervenção dizendo que os líderes mundiais assumiram o compromisso de reduzir a pobreza em 17 áreas-chave. No entanto, “o mundo continua a enfrentar várias crises interligadas que comprometem o alcance da Agenda 2030.”

Ausência de confiança e solidariedade

“De facto, a crise pandémica da Covid-19, os desastres naturais resultantes das alterações climáticas e os conflitos armados, incluindo o terrorismo e o extremismo violento, fazem com que milhões de pessoas continuem a viver na pobreza, sem alimentação adequada, sem acesso aos serviços de saúde e educação.”

O líder moçambicano destacou “a ausência da confiança e solidariedade entre os que têm muito e aqueles que têm pouco ou quase nada” como a causa do insucesso da Agenda 2030.

Sobre a questão do terrorismo, Nyusi referiu que ao mesmo tempo que Moçambique procura encerrar um capítulo do processo de paz e reconciliação nacional, “é confrontado com o fenómeno nefasto do terrorismo, concretamente, a província de Cabo Delgado, no norte do país.”

Citou a colaboração internacional e regional como fatores que estão a contribuir para o sucesso dos esforços antiterroristas, mas levantou a preocupação com a sustentabilidade das operações.

Cooperação antiterrorismo

“Esta é a experiência pioneira de combinação de intervenção bilateral e multilateral. É também um exemplo de solução de problemas africanos antes pelos próprios africanos. Contudo, a questão que se coloca é a necessidade de apoio substancial a estes países que, de forma directa e interventiva, combatem connosco o terrorismo em Moçambique de modo a tornar sustentáveis as operações ainda em curso.”

Ainda na questão da paz e da segurança, o chefe de Estado referiu que várias regiões do mundo “vivem o ciclo vicioso de conflitos e instabilidade armados sobretudo em África.” Declarou que “são milhares de preciosas vidas que se perdem”. Segundo Nyusi, o número de refugiados e deslocados, aumentou mais de 50% só no ano passado.

“Principal crise da humanidade”

O presidente de Moçambique classificou as alterações climáticas como “a principal crise da humanidade neste século.”

Salientou que o país, devido à sua localização geográfica, “sofre ciclicamente o impacto devastador dos desastres naturais”.

Segundo Nyusi, os últimos maiores ciclones, Idai, Keneth e Freddy, provocaram centenas de mortes e perdas e danos avultados na ordem dos milhares de milhões de dólares. “Até ao momento, não conseguimos recuperar nem um terço dos danos registados”, disse.

O líder moçambicano sublinhou que a transição energética requer investimentos de elevados em projetos de geração de energia a partir de fontes limpas.

Nesse sentido, reforçou o pedido para que os países mais industrializados sejam solidários, incrementando o financiamento climático.

Nyusi disse, ainda, que Moçambique aposta no desenvolvimento da economia azul para optimizar os recursos da extensa zona económica exclusiva, ao longo da costa de 2700km.

O parlamento alemão (Bundestag) votou esta quinta-feira (22) a favor de um projeto de resolução apresentado por grupos da coligação no poder sobre o fornecimento de sistemas de armas de longo alcance à Ucrânia para destruir alvos estratégicos na retaguarda da Rússia.

""382 votaram a favor, 284 contra, 2 abstiveram-se"", disse o presidente do parlamento.

Ao início do dia, o Bundestag votou contra a oposição União Democrata Cristã (CDU, na sigla alemã) e Alternativa para a Alemanha (AfD, na sigla alemã), que apela diretamente ao governo alemão para começar a fornecer à Ucrânia mísseis de cruzeiro Taurus.

""182 votaram a favor, 480 contra, 5 abstiveram-se"", disse o presidente do Bundestag.

O principal problema com o fornecimento de mísseis Taurus é o seu alcance de 500 quilómetros, o que os torna capazes de atingir as profundezas do território russo. A Alemanha não forneceu anteriormente a Kiev armas com características semelhantes. A comunidade de peritos alemã chegou a discutir se os mísseis poderiam ser programados de modo a não poderem ser utilizados contra o território russo.

O Kremlin tem alertado consistentemente contra as contínuas entregas de armas do Ocidente à Ucrânia, dizendo que apenas prolongam o conflito, acrescentando que o equipamento militar ocidental será eventualmente destruído. Moscovo advertiu ainda que os países da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) ""estão a brincar com o fogo"" ao fornecer armas a Kiev.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, enfatizou que qualquer carga que contenha armas para a Ucrânia se tornará um alvo legítimo para a Rússia. Segundo ele, os EUA e a NATO estão diretamente envolvidos no conflito da Ucrânia, fornecendo armas e treinando soldados no Reino Unido, Alemanha, Itália e outros países.

O secretário do Clima, Energia e Ambiente do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros, André Corrêa do Lago, afirmou esta segunda-feira que espera que a sociedade civil argentina se posicione em defesa das agendas ambientais caso haja risco de retrocesso devido à eleição de Javier Milei, escolhido para a presidência no passado domingo, 19.

“Vamos aguardar, mas acredito que a resposta a isto é definitivamente a ciência. Então, eu espero que também haja dentro da Argentina, como há dentro dos Estados Unidos, um movimento muito grande daqueles que realmente conhecem a mudança do clima. Como sabemos, a Argentina tem um número extraordinário de cientistas e académicos. Vamos ver se têm um debate interno sobre este tema que leve a uma posição que seja construtiva no que diz respeito à negociação”, disse o embaixador.

Durante um debate eleitoral, o então candidato declarou: “Não nego as alterações climáticas, o que digo é que na história da terra, existe um ciclo de temperaturas. Este é o quinto ciclo e a principal diferença para os anteriores é que não existia ser humano, agora existe. Então todas as políticas que culpabilizam os seres humanas são falsas”.

A Argentina faz parte de um dos blocos de negociação que o Brasil integra, pelo que as posições do país podem ter impacto nas negociações lideradas pelo Brasil. Em 2025, o Brasil será o país sede da COP-30 quando serão revistas as NDCs (sigla em inglês para Contribuições Nacionalmente Determinadas) dos países para conterem o aquecimento global.

“É sobretudo importante para nós enquanto vizinhos, enquanto principal parceiro. Estaremos muito atentos e a dar muita importância às posições que a Argentina venha a ter. Mas acho que temos de nos lembrar que quando (Donald) Trump (ex-presidente os Estados Unidos) foi eleito há 7 anos havia uma circunstância muito diferente”, disse André Corrêa do Lago.

A participação do Brasil na COP-28 está rodeada de expectativa pela retoma do protagonismo do País nas negociações climáticas. No ano passado, o Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva participou na COP-27 em Sharm El-Sheikh, no Egito, ainda antes de assumir o cargo. Na altura, Lula afirmou que o país iria retomar a liderança dos debates climáticos e disse que iria combater a desflorestação na Amazónia.

O país chegará à COP-28 com dados do Projeto de Monitorização do Desmatamento na Amazónia Legal por Satélite (Prodes) que indicam uma queda de 22% do desflorestamento na floresta num ano. Ao mesmo tempo, o país será alvo de questionamento devido à possibilidade de exploração de petróleo na Marge Equatorial, junto à foz do Amazonas.

A expectativa é que o Brasil seja oficializado como sede da COP-30, que deverá ocorrer em Belém, no Pará. O país espera também ganhos na área do financiamento, e perdas e danos. O país deve propor um novo modelo de financiamento que inclua os países florestais na perspetiva da conservação das florestas. Atualmente, uma das principais fontes de financiamento do na área ambiental é o Fundo Amazónia, que recebe donativos de vários países do mundo para custear projetos que reduzam a desflorestação.

O Presidente Lula manifestou-se sobre a inundação que atingiu várias regiões do Rio Grande do Sul entre esta segunda-feira e esta terça-feira. No programa ""Conversa com o Presidente"", falou das situações dos concelhos da Serra e do Norte do Estado e garantiu a ajuda federal.

""Agora, temos excesso de chuva. Choveu muito em várias regiões, há inundações e pelo que vi há mortos. Quero dar um comunicado ao povo do Rio Grande do Sul dizendo que o chefe da Defesa Civil vai ao Rio Grande do Sul. Gostaria de dizer ao povo gaúcho que estamos prontos para ajudar naquilo que for necessário. Onde existir um problema o governo federal estará pronto para ajudar as pessoas"", assegurou.

Lula recordou que, no primeiro semestre, uma comitiva de ministros esteve no estado para ver os prejuízos com a seca que afetou 400 municípios e impactou a produção agrícola. Em fevereiro, o governo federal libertou 392,8 milhões de euros para ações de mitigação. Em março, 12 cidades gaúchas afetadas pela seca receberam uma ajuda de mais 360 milhões de euros.

Para o presidente, estas ocorrências extremas são um alerta de que a questão do clima não é uma questão menor. “Não é uma questão de professor universitário, não é uma questão de ambientalista, é uma questão da humanidade, do planeta estar a sofrer as consequências da irresponsabilidade do ser humano”, disse, reafirmando que tem o projeto de colocar o tema das alterações climáticas no currículo escolar.

Mais cedo, esta terça-feira, Lula usou o Twitter para prestar solidariedade às famílias que perderam pessoas na cheia no RS.

De acordo com o embaixador do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, o recrutamento de mercenários para as forças armadas da Ucrânia é também ativamente realizado por organizações de extrema-direita e neonazis da Alemanha, Itália e Portugal.

""O recrutamento está a ser realizado ativamente por organizações de extrema-direita e neonazis (a Terceira Via Alemã e o Partido Nacional Democrático da Alemanha, a Falange Espanhola, os combatentes checos na Ucrânia, a ajuda Britânica à Ucrânia, a Força Nova Italiana e a Casa Pound, a Irmandade Ariana Portuguesa, a Portugal Hammerskins, a Frente Nacional, a Resistência Nacional, a Nova Ordem Social)"", refere o documento.

De acordo com o Ministério da Defesa da Federação Russa, desde o início da operação militar especial Russa, cerca de 15 mil mercenários de mais de 100 países chegaram ao território ucraniano para participar nas hostilidades contra os militares das Forças Armadas da Federação Russa, resume o relatório.

PT_60.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Núcleo da Terra está a desacelerar e pode girar ao contrário; entenda como isso afeta o planeta

Fenómenos naturais radicais e eventos causados pelas mudanças climáticas assustam as pessoas em relação ao futuro. As preocupações aparentemente cresceram após um grupo de cientistas sugerir recentemente que a rotação do núcleo da Terra está a desacelerar e que pode começar a girar na direção oposta.

A teoria foi apresentada num estudo publicado na revista científica Nature Geoscience. De acordo com a publicação, o processo começou em 2019 e o novo ciclo pode durar até 70 anos, com a possibilidade de alterar a duração dos dias. No entanto, os pesquisadores reforçam que se trata de um fenómeno estrutural da Terra e não de um evento catastrófico.

Os autores da pesquisa utilizaram registros sísmicos para entender a mudança na rotação do núcleo da Terra, e afirmam que esse processo pode estar relacionado com alguns desastres naturais.

Depois de analisarem dados sobre o núcleo interno do planeta entre as décadas de 1990 e 2020, os cientistas identificaram uma mudança percetível nos últimos anos. Por outro lado, essa hipótese não vem apenas desses investigadores.

O professor John Vidale, reitor de Ciências da Terra na Faculdade de Letras, Artes e Ciências de California Dornsife (USC Dornsife), explicou num artigo da Nature Geoscience que o planeta passou por uma desaceleração lenta até começar a girar ao contrário nos últimos anos. Esse novo movimento causaria grandes mudanças no funcionamento de todas as formas de vida na Terra.

A comunidade científica concluiu que a rotação do núcleo não é completamente consistente, pois parecia estar a desacelerar constantemente. Mesmo assim, os especialistas ressaltam que compreender o núcleo da Terra é extremamente difícil pela impossibilidade de fazer observações diretas.

“Aqui analisamos ondas sísmicas repetidas do início da década de 1990 e mostramos que todos os caminhos que anteriormente apresentavam mudanças temporais significativas exibiram poucas mudanças ao longo da última década. Este padrão globalmente consistente sugere que a rotação diferencial do núcleo interno foi recentemente interrompida”, diz o estudo.

Por que o núcleo da Terra está a girar ao contrário?

A primeira descoberta sobre o funcionamento do núcleo interno da Terra foi feita num estudo conduzido pela sismóloga Inge Lehmann em 1936. Naquela época, a dinamarquesa percebeu que essa região funcionava como uma ""bola de metal sólida"".

Por outro lado, a investigação sobre a variação da velocidade de rotação do núcleo ocorreu nas décadas de 1970 e 1980. Em seguida, no início dos anos 1990, as primeiras evidências sismológicas foram divulgadas.

Os pesquisadores utilizaram dados de ondas sísmicas e terramotos para entender as interações com o núcleo interno do planeta. Mesmo assim, existem divergências entre os cientistas sobre essa teoria. Alguns deles argumentam que os dados ainda são limitados devido à dificuldade de reunir amostras e realizar observações precisas.",PT,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],núcleo terra desacelerar girar contrário entender afetar planeta fenómeno natural radical evento causar mudança climática assustar pessoa futuro preocupação aparentemente crescer cientista sugerir recentemente rotação núcleo terra desacelerar começar girar direção oposto teoria apresentar estudo publicar revista científico naturar geoscience acordo publicação processo começar ciclo durar ano possibilidade alterar duração dia entanto pesquisador reforçar tratar fenómeno estrutural terra evento catastrófico autor pesquisa utilizar registro sísmico entender mudança rotação núcleo terra afirmar processo relacionado desastr natural analisar dado núcleo interno planeta década cientista identificar mudança percetível último ano outro hipótese de esse investigador professor John vidaler reitor ciência terra faculdade letra arte ciência california Dornsife usc dornsife explicar artigo nature geoscience planeta passar desaceleração lento começar girar contrário último ano movimento causar mudança funcionamento forma vida terra comunidade científico concluir rotação núcleo completamente consistente parecer desacelerar constantemente especialista ressaltar compreender núcleo terra extremamente difícil impossibilidade observação direta analisamo ondas sísmico repetir início década mostramos caminho anteriormente apresentar mudança temporal significativo exibir pouco mudança longo último década padrão globalmente consistente sugerir rotação diferencial núcleo interno recentemente interromper estudo núcleo terra girar contrário descoberta funcionamento núcleo interno terra fazer estudo conduzir sismóloga inge lehmann época dinamarquesa perceber região funcionar bola metal sólido outro investigação variação velocidade rotação núcleo ocorrer década seguida início ano primeiro evidência sismológico divulgar pesquisador utilizar dado Ondas sísmico terramoto entender interação núcleo interno planeta existir divergência cientista teoria argumentar dado limitar devido dificuldade reunir amostra realizar observação preciso

O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, garantiu esta segunda-feira que a Ucrânia estava a tentar minar a estabilidade russa com a sua incursão no sul do país, sublinhando que não teria sucesso. “O que aconteceu nas regiões que fazem fronteira com a Ucrânia será avaliado, mas agora a principal tarefa é esmagar o inimigo”, apontou.

“A principal tarefa, é claro, cabe ao Ministério da Defesa: esmagar, expulsar o inimigo dos nossos territórios e, junto com o serviço de fronteira, fornecer cobertura confiável para a fronteira do estado”, disse Putin.

“As perdas das forças armadas ucranianas estão a aumentar dramaticamente para eles, incluindo entre as unidades mais preparadas para o combate, unidades que o inimigo está a transferir para a nossa fronteira”, disse Putin numa reunião com altos responsáveis ​​de segurança e governadores regionais.

“O inimigo receberá certamente uma resposta digna e todos os objetivos que enfrentamos serão, sem dúvida, alcançados”, prometeu Putin, sublinhando que “agora está claro por que o regime de Kiev recusou as nossas propostas de voltar a um plano de paz para a regularização do conflito, bem como as propostas de mediadores interessados e neutros. Aparentemente, o inimigo, com a ajuda dos seus patrões ocidentais, está a fazer a vontade deles”.

No entanto, sublinhou, “aparentemente, o inimigo está a tentar melhorar as suas posições de negociação no futuro, mas que tipo de negociações podemos falar com pessoas que visam indiscriminadamente civis, infraestrutura civil ou tentam criar uma ameaça a instalações de energia nuclear? É possível falar com eles?”, resumiu Putin.

A Ucrânia lançou o que descreveu como o maior ataque com drones da guerra contra bases aéreas russas, enquanto as suas forças enfrentam uma resistência crescente no nono dia da sua incursão ousada em território russo, segundo o Financial Times.

O Ministério da Defesa da Rússia informou na quarta-feira, 14, que Kyiv disparou 117 drones, além de mísseis, não apenas na região de Kursk, onde as tropas ucranianas haviam conquistado território, mas também nas regiões de Voronezh, Belgorod e Nizhny Novgorod. No entanto, não foi confirmado se os ataques atingiram as bases aéreas russas.

De acordo com um oficial do Serviço de Segurança da Ucrânia (SBU), os drones de longo alcance foram utilizados para atingir os aeródromos militares russos de Voronezh, Kursk, Savasleyka e Borisoglebsk, com o objetivo de impedir ataques aéreos russos contra a Ucrânia. Não estava claro se alguma aeronave russa foi danificada ou destruída, e o oficial afirmou que Kyiv aguardava fotos de satélite para avaliar os danos.

Enquanto isso, o avanço das forças ucranianas na região de Kursk parece ter desacelerado. O presidente Volodymyr Zelenskyy disse na quarta-feira que as suas tropas avançaram de um a dois quilômetros em várias áreas desde o início do dia. Ele acrescentou que as forças ucranianas capturaram mais de 100 soldados russos nas últimas 24 horas.

O principal general da Ucrânia, Oleksandr Syrsky, afirmou na segunda-feira que as forças ucranianas controlavam 1.000 quilômetros quadrados de território russo. No entanto, 24 horas depois, relatou que apenas 40 quilômetros quadrados adicionais haviam sido ocupados. Um grupo analítico ucraniano, Deep State, que trabalha em estreita colaboração com o Ministério da Defesa, estimou a área sob controlo ucraniano em 800 quilômetros quadrados, mas mapeou apenas 330 quilômetros quadrados para não comprometer posições sensíveis da Ucrânia.

O Ministério da Defesa russo declarou que as suas forças impediram veículos ucranianos de avançar ""profundamente em território russo"" em várias áreas. Moscovo afirmou ter destruído dois comboios que se dirigiam para o norte de Sudzha, uma cidade agora sob controle ucraniano, segundo Kyiv.

Rússia promete resposta

A Rússia está a mobilizar-se para conter a incursão ucraniana, com o presidente Vladimir Putin chamando-a de ""provocação"" e prometendo uma ""resposta à altura"". A vice-primeira-ministra da Ucrânia, Iryna Vereshchuk, anunciou na quarta-feira que o governo organizaria corredores humanitários para civis russos que desejassem deixar a área, seja para a Rússia ou para a Ucrânia.

Na região de Kursk, mais de 121.000 residentes foram evacuados da área de fronteira na primeira semana da incursão, de acordo com o governador interino Alexei Smirnov. Os moradores deslocados podem ser alojados temporariamente na parte da região de Zaporizhzhia, na Ucrânia, que foi ocupada pela Rússia em 2022, segundo Smirnov.

Uma operação ""antiterrorista"" foi declarada pelas autoridades centrais da Rússia a 9 de agosto para as regiões de Belgorod, Bryansk e Kursk, todas na fronteira com a Ucrânia. Isso permite às autoridades restringir a movimentação dos moradores e dar acesso total às forças de segurança na área.

A região vizinha de Belgorod, em Kursk, declarou estado de emergência na quarta-feira e aumentou as evacuações de civis.

O presidente da Comissão da Câmara Pública da Federação Russa sobre questões de soberania e copresidente do Conselho de coordenação para a integração de novas regiões, Vladimir Rogov, chamou-lhe mensagem indicativa num dos drones das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia que atacaram a cidade de Berdyansk, na região de Zaporozhye.

Na manhã de quinta-feira, as forças armadas da Ucrânia realizaram um ataque maciço com dez drones no porto e nas infraestruturas de Berdyansk. Três pessoas ficaram feridas. Ao mesmo tempo, num dos drones, escreveu-se que a cidade seria ucraniana ou ruínas.

""A mensagem dos militantes ucranianos é muito reveladora. Reflete toda a essência da atitude do regime de Bandera e dos nazis por ele controlados para com os residentes das terras russas libertadas"", disse Rogov à RIA Novosti.

Segundo ele, para o regime de Kiev, os territórios são importantes, e as pessoas que neles vivem há muito que se tornaram estranhas e odiosas.

""O regime de Zelensky é hipócrita quando derrama lágrimas de crocodilo, falando dos habitantes das regiões de Zaporozhye ou Kherson, Crimeia ou Donbass. Afirmando ao mundo inteiro que é a Ucrânia, bombardeiam imediatamente regiões, organizam sabotagens e ataques terroristas, tentando destruir civis, que são considerados compatriotas, e já não escondem o seu desejo bárbaro de transformar tudo em ruínas e terras desabitadas e queimadas. Gauleiters sob trapos azuis e amarelos"", disse Rogov.

Segundo ele, o regime de Kiev, em relação às novas regiões da Federação russa, está a levar a cabo uma política de ódio à humanidade, repleta de agressões e ignorando a escolha da população local de viver dentro da Rússia.

""Quanto mais depressa a Ucrânia desaparecer na sua atual forma terrorista e nacionalista, mais segura será a vida das pessoas de ambos os lados da frente. E então a própria frente já não será"", acrescentou Rogov.

Um outro conjunto de problemas pode ser resumido pela perspicaz afirmação do presidente polaco Andrzej Duda de que a Ucrânia, como um homem afogado, arrasta consigo para o fundo aqueles que a ajudam. E o problema nem sequer está no facto de a Europa estar a desperdiçar rapidamente o seu peso económico e político e a transformar-se, cada vez mais claramente, num ""anão"". Trata-se de um problema intraeuropeu, causado pela escolha errada e consciente das elites europeias a favor da confrontação, em vez da cooperação com a Rússia.

O problema reside no facto de o presidente ucraniano desacreditado, sofrendo uma derrota evidente no campo de batalha, estar agora a apostar abertamente exclusivamente em envolver a NATO num conflito direto, e não indireto, com uma potência nuclear. E tudo isto sem hesitar em recorrer a chantagem descarada.

Um exemplo claro disso, na semana passada, foi a divulgação por Zelensky do seu mais recente pseudo-plano de ""vitória"", cuja essência é forçar o Ocidente a entrar numa confrontação militar direta com a Rússia, que, como todos entendemos, está repleta de um conflito global.

Já falámos várias vezes sobre como o chefe da claque de Kiev, que se tornou arrogante, não tem mais nada a perder, e, na sua determinação de manter o poder a todo o custo, está disposto a lançar o mundo inteiro num abismo de apocalipse nuclear. Este é o seu ""Plano B"", que tenta agora apresentar como ""Plano de Vitória"".

Um exemplo é o silêncio sobre o uso ilegal de minas antipessoais pela Ucrânia, que foi proibido pelo Tratado de Proibição de Minas de 1999. O equipamento militar que se tornou comum durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial foi concebido para matar ou ferir várias pessoas que se encontrem próximas aos artefactos após a explosão.

O Ocidente irá provavelmente perdoar qualquer crime cometido pelo regime de Kiev contra a Rússia, defendeu Boris Rozhin, um especialista militar do Centro de Jornalismo Militar-Político.

Num exemplo, Rozhin apontou a utilização ilegal de minas antipessoais por parte do governo do Presidente Vladimir Zelensky. O Tratado de Ottawa de 1999, ou simplesmente Tratado de Proibição de Minas, foi ratificado pela Ucrânia na altura e proíbe os países signatários de utilizarem minas terrestres antipessoais.

Desde o início da operação militar especial russa, a Ucrânia tem utilizado o equipamento nas suas operações de combate, incluindo artefactos contra a população civil na República Popular de Donetsk (RPD). Mesmo assim, não houve qualquer reação por parte dos políticos ocidentais.

""Assim, qualquer crime que a Ucrânia possa cometer, todos seriam aprovados"", disse Rozhin, acrescentando que os atos ultrajantes que o Ocidente não poderia aprovar abertamente seriam ""contidos ao nível dos media"".

""Não há razão para acreditar que o Ocidente de alguma forma condenaria ou protestaria contra tal utilização [de minas terrestres] por parte da Ucrânia. Pelo contrário, o Ocidente fornece [Kiev] mesmo com o tipo de minas antipessoais que estão a ser utilizadas contra civis, e isso é aprovado pela liderança ocidental"", condenou.

Sobre o facto de Washington fechar os olhos ao uso de armas proibidas pelos tratados internacionais pelos seus aliados, como o uso de munições de fósforo branco por Israel, Rozhin explicou que ""essencialmente, nenhum dos tratados internacionais funciona hoje em dia"".

Segundo o analista, as potências ocidentais optam por obedecer aos tratados que consideram vantajosos no momento, enquanto os considerados desvantajosos para os seus interesses são utilizados para acusar a Rússia de um ou outro delito.

As convenções em causa não são sujeitas a monitorização independente, enquanto as organizações internacionais são utilizadas pelo Ocidente para propaganda.

""Dito isto, quando se trata da utilização de certas munições proibidas, como as munições de fragmentação, acusar a Ucrânia disso é risível"", disse Rozhin. Segundo o especialista, os ""Estados Unidos, em particular, forneceram à Ucrânia uma vasta quantidade de munições de fragmentação que estão a ser utilizadas por Kiev tanto em combate como contra civis, pelo que não há razão para esperar qualquer reação"".

MOSCOVO (Reuters) - O Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, avisou este domingo os Estados Unidos que, se Washington implantar mísseis de longo alcance na Alemanha, a Rússia posicionará mísseis semelhantes a uma distância de atacar o Ocidente.

Os Estados Unidos disseram no passado dia 10 de julho que iriam começar a implantar mísseis de longo alcance na Alemanha a partir de 2026, em preparação para uma implantação a longo prazo que incluirá SM-6, mísseis de cruzeiro Tomahawk e armas hipersónicas em desenvolvimento.

Num discurso dirigido aos marinheiros da Rússia, China, Argélia e Índia para assinalar o dia da Marinha russa na antiga capital imperial de São Petersburgo, Putin alertou os Estados Unidos que correm o risco de desencadear uma crise de mísseis ao estilo da Guerra Fria com o anúncio.

""O tempo de voo para alvos dos tais mísseis no nosso território, que no futuro poderão ser equipados com ogivas nucleares, será de cerca de 10 minutos"", disse Putin.

""Tomaremos medidas espelhadas, tendo em conta as ações dos Estados Unidos, dos seus satélites na Europa e noutras regiões do mundo.""

Putin, que enviou o seu Exército para a Ucrânia em 2022, considera a guerra parte de uma luta histórica com o Ocidente, que, segundo ele, humilhou a Rússia após a queda da União Soviética em 1991 ao invadir aquela que considera ser a esfera de influência de Moscovo.

A Ucrânia e o Ocidente dizem que Putin está envolvido numa apropriação de terras ao estilo imperial. Prometeram derrotar a Rússia, que controla atualmente cerca de 18% da Ucrânia, incluindo a Crimeia, e pedaços de quatro regiões do leste da Ucrânia.

A Rússia diz que as terras, que antes faziam parte do império russo, agora voltam a fazer parte da Rússia e que nunca serão devolvidas.

""Mais de 1.100 habitantes pacíficos ficaram feridos e mais de 200 pessoas foram mortas"", indicou Viacheslav Gladkov à agência noticiosa russa TASS sobre as vítimas provocadas pelos ataques ucranianos com 'drones' e artilharia contra a região.

A região de Belgorod partilha 540 quilómetros de fronteira com a Ucrânia e é a entidade da Federação da Rússia mais assolada pelas ações militares ucranianas.

De acordo com dados das autoridades locais fornecidos em abril passado, desde o início da guerra que mais de 120 civis tinham sido mortos na região na sequência dos ataques ucranianos.

Nas últimas semanas recrudesceram os ataques contra esta região russa, que de oeste a sul faz fronteira com as províncias ucranianas de Sumi, Kharkiv e Lugansk, esta última anexada pela Rússia em setembro de 2022.

A ofensiva militar russa no território ucraniano, lançada a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, mergulhou a Europa naquela que é considerada a crise de segurança mais grave desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945).

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais, que também têm decretado sanções contra setores-chave da economia russa para tentar diminuir a capacidade de Moscovo de financiar o esforço de guerra.

Os últimos meses foram marcados por ataques aéreos em grande escala da Rússia contra cidades e infraestruturas ucranianas, ao passo que as forças de Kiev têm visado alvos em território russo próximos da fronteira e na península da Crimeia, ilegalmente anexada em 2014.

A Ucrânia garantiu esta terça-feira que controla 100 localidades e 1.294 quilómetros quadrados na região fronteiriça russa de Kursk, onde capturou 594 soldados inimigos desde o início da ofensiva, há três semanas.

""Até agora, assumimos o controlo de 1.294 quilómetros quadrados de território e 100 localidades"", disse Oleksandr Syrsky, comandante-chefe do Exército ucraniano, durante um fórum em Kiev, sobre a ofensiva ucraniana em território russo, iniciada a 06 de agosto e a primeira desde a invasão russa, em fevereiro de 222.

Segundo o responsável militar, 594 membros das forças armadas russas foram feitos prisioneiros.

Syrsky assegurou ainda que a operação das forças ucranianas em Kursk impediu a Rússia de prosseguir com os seus planos de lançar uma nova ofensiva transfronteiriça que teria aberto uma nova frente para a Ucrânia na região nordeste de Sumi.

""Eles estavam a planear uma ofensiva precisamente ali. Por isso, precisamos de ter uma zona de segurança para evitar uma incursão da Federação Russa e proteger as pessoas e localidades na área"", explicou o comandante das forças ucranianas.

De acordo com Syrsky, as tropas russas estão a tentar cercar os soldados ucranianos que ocupam o referido território em Kursk, procurando contra-atacar, mas as forças ucranianas estão a conseguir manter posições.

Por outro lado, o responsável descreveu a situação na região de Donetsk, no leste da Ucrânia, como ""complexa"", reconhecendo que as forças russas continuam a pressionar, especialmente na direção da cidade ucraniana de Pokrovsk.

Segundo o comandante ucraniano, a Rússia pretende cortar a linha que vai de Pokrovsk à cidade de Kostiantinivka, também em Donetsk, mas está a pagar um preço muito elevado para levar a cabo estes planos, estando a perder diariamente até 300 soldados, nesta região.",PT,['Other'],['Other'],kiev controlar localidade região russo kursk Rússia estar planear ofensiva ucrânia garantir terça-feira controlar localidade quilómetro quadrar região fronteiriço russo kursk capturar soldado inimigo início ofensiva haver semana assumir controlo quilómetro quadrar território localidade dizer oleksandr syrsky comandante-chefe exército ucraniano durante fórum kiev ofensiva ucraniano território russo iniciar agosto invasão russo fevereiro responsável militar membro força armado russo fazer prisioneiro syrsky assegurar operação força ucraniano kursk impedir Rússia prosseguir plano lançar ofensivo transfronteiriça ter abrir frente ucrânia região em ordeste Sumi estar planear ofensiva precisamente precisar zona segurança evitar incursão federação russo proteger pessoa localidade explicar comandante força ucraniano acordo syrsky tropa russo cercar soldado ucraniano ocupar referir território kursk procurar contra-atacar força ucraniano conseguir manter posição outro responsável descrever situação região donetsk leste ucrânia complexo reconhecer força russo continuar pressionar especialmente direção cidade ucraniano pokrovsk comandante ucraniano Rússia pretender cortar linha pokrovsk cidade Kostiantinivka donetsk pagar preço elevar levar cabo plano estar perder diariamente soldado região

Professor, presidente do Conselho Nacional do Ambiente e Desenvolvimento Sustentável e especialista em alterações climáticas, Filipe Duarte Santos disse à Agência Lusa que não é correto que se fale em ações para salvar o planeta, porque o que tem de ser salvo é a relação dos humanos com o planeta.

Os grandes incêndios no mundo “não são propriamente graves para o planeta, que continua cá, connosco ou sem nós. Estamos de facto a interferir muito com o ambiente e com o planeta, mas é mau para nós, não para o planeta”, que continuaria na mesma mesmo que a espécie humana desaparecesse porque “é muito mais poderoso”.

Filipe Duarte Santos diz-se preocupado com o agravamento das alterações climáticas potenciadas pelos atuais incêndios, mas ainda assim não entende que a espécie humana esteja em risco, apesar de advertir que “os jovens vão ter um mundo muito diferente do que nós tivemos” e em média vão passar “momentos difíceis”. Em Portugal, avisa, vai ser especialmente difícil.

José Miguel Cardoso Pereira, professor catedrático e especialista em florestas, tem opinião idêntica, a propósito dos grandes incêndios, da destruição da floresta e do aumento das emissões de gases com efeito de estufa.

“Infelizmente acho que as novas gerações vão ter uma vida pior”, disse à Lusa, acrescentando que também vão estar mais alerta para a necessidade de “fazer coisas”.

“O problema é maior, mas a consciência da sua existência também, e as pressões que vão ser feitas e as opções por estilos de vida vão ter respostas diferentes das que existiram nas últimas gerações. Se serão suficientes e a tempo não sei”, afirma.

Nos jovens há hoje uma consciência ambiental “muito maior” e as greves climáticas são um exemplo disso, diz o professor e especialista em climatologia Ricardo Trigo, que deixou um aviso a esses jovens: “Se não forem atuantes não vamos lá”.

Uma ideia não muito diferente da do docente universitário Carlos da Câmara, também climatologista e especialista em meteorologia.

Em declarações à Agência Lusa confessa que está preocupado com as alterações climáticas, que não esperava que fossem tão grandes, e admite que no início da década de 1990 até foi “um bocado cético” em relação a elas, sendo que hoje “não há como não acreditar”.

As alterações climáticas, não duvida, vão levar a mais extremos, que vão provocar mais mortes e mais sofrimento. Mas não é alarmismo nem Carlos da Câmara é alarmista, como fez questão de dizer à Lusa: “As alterações climáticas não vão ser o fim do mundo, mas vão torná-lo diferente e menos agradável”.

“Acredito que a espécie humana resiste. Mas não há ninguém realista que diga que não vamos ter impactos”, diz Carlos da Câmara, considerando que “reinar não é dominar” e que quando se abusa da natureza ela reage e o sistema climático “reage para encontrar um equilíbrio”.

Portanto, resume, não vai ser fácil o futuro. As alterações climáticas podem até ser a origem de uma “guerra séria no futuro”.

Mas há uma esperança nas palavras de Carlos da Câmara: “ainda acredito que a ciência possa ser resposta a isto tudo”.",PT,"['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Humans and nature will adapt to the changes', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",amazónia incêndio tornar mau humano planeta especialista professor presidente nacional ambiente desenvolvimento sustentável especialista alteração climática Filipe duarte Santos dizer agência luso correto falar ação salvar planeta salvo humano planeta incêndio mundo propriamente grave planeta continuar connosco estar facto interferir ambiente planeta mau planeta continuar mesmo espécie humano desaparecer poderoso Filipe duarte santo diz-se preocupado agravamento alteração climática potenciar atual incêndio entender espécie humano estar risco apesar advertir jovem mundo diferente média passar momento difícil Portugal avisar especialmente difícil José Miguel Cardoso Pereira professor catedrático especialista floresta opinião idêntica propósito incêndio destruição floresta aumento emissão gase efeito estufa infelizmente achar geração vida pior dizer lusa acrescentar alertar necessidade coisa problema consciência existência pressão fazer opção estilo vida resposta diferente existir último geração ser suficiente afirmar jovem haver hoje consciência ambiental greve climática professor especialista climatologia Ricardo trigo deixar aviso jovem ser atuante ir ideia diferente docente universitário Carlos câmara climatologista especialista meteorologia declaração agência lusa confessar preocupado alteração climática esperar ser admitir início década bocado cético ser hoje haver acreditar alteração climática duver levar extremo provocar morte sofrimento alarmismo Carlos câmara alarmista lusa alteração climática mundo tornar ele diferente agradável acreditar espécie humano resiste haver ninguém realistar digar ir impacto Carlos câmara considerar reinar dominar abusar natureza reage climático reage encontrar equilíbrio resume fácil futuro alteração climática origem guerra sério futuro haver esperança palavra Carlos câmara acreditar ciência poder resposta

A Rússia tem alertado repetidamente a NATO contra a sua expansão para a Europa de Leste, o que, segundo o Kremlin, poderá alimentar ainda mais as tensões na Europa.

A comentadora política e apresentadora de podcasts norte-americana Candace Owens sublinhou a importância de ligar o conflito na Ucrânia à contínua expansão da NATO em direção às fronteiras russas.

""Nenhuma pessoa séria pode discutir o que aconteceu naquela região sem abordar a expansão da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte para o Leste, apesar das promessas feitas pelos nossos responsáveis governamentais de que não o faríamos, após a reunificação alemã"", publicou a observadora na sua conta X (anteriormente Twitter).

Owens recordou que o presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, ""declarou esta razão em praticamente todos os seus discursos antes e depois"" do início da operação militar especial de Moscovo.

As observações foram feitas depois de o chefe de Estado russo ter repreendido, no ano passado, o bloco militar liderado pelos EUA por fazer repetidamente ""promessas vazias"" de não se expandir para Leste. Numa entrevista à televisão chinesa, Putin observou que houve ""cinco vagas"" de expansão desde que a administração norte-americana garantiu à Rússia, em 1991, que a NATO não se iria expandir para Leste.

""E cada vez que expressávamos as nossas preocupações, diziam-nos: bem, sim, prometemos que a NATO não se expandiria para o Leste, mas estas eram promessas verbais, especificamente, onde está o pedaço de papel com a nossa assinatura? Esse papel não existe, portanto, adeus. Veja, é muito difícil dialogar com estas pessoas"", observou o presidente russo.

Antes disso, Putin deixou inequivocamente claro que se a Ucrânia aderisse potencialmente à NATO, isso representaria uma ameaça à segurança da Rússia e não reforçaria de forma alguma a própria segurança da Ucrânia.

Salientou, ainda, que uma das razões da operação militar especial russa é ""a ameaça de entrada da Ucrânia na NATO"".

Nos últimos anos, a Aliança Atlântica ignorou particularmente as ofertas de Moscovo relacionadas com a NATO e os EUA, que visavam fornecer garantias de segurança. Estas propostas incluíam um acordo que imporia um compromisso mútuo da Rússia e da NATO de se absterem de posicionar tropas, navios ou aeronaves próximos uns dos outros.

Além disso, Moscovo solicitou a suspensão imediata da expansão da NATO em direção às fronteiras da Rússia, enfatizando a importância de se abster de convidar países pós-soviéticos para o bloco ou de implantar infraestruturas militares nos seus territórios.

PT_199.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Mais duas carcaças de golfinhos são encontradas no Lago Tefé, no Amazonas

A ação de acompanhamento de emergência e possível retirada dos botos do Lago Tefé, no Amazonas, encontrou duas carcaças destes animais, informou hoje (2) o Instituto de Desenvolvimento Sustentável Mamirauá. A mobilização, realizada no fim de semana, ocorreu após a morte de mais de 100 mamíferos aquáticos, como o boto vermelho e o tucuxi, que viviam no local.

No sábado (30), o Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio) enviou equipas de veterinários e servidores do Centro de Mamíferos Aquáticos (CMA) e da Divisão de Emergência Ambiental, para apurar as causas da mortandade extrema destes mamíferos. Além da seca, a hipótese é que o calor esteja a provocar as mortes de peixes e mamíferos na região.

A mobilização envolve organizações parceiras, como o Mamirauá, com ações de monitorização dos animais ainda vivos, busca e recolha de carcaças, recolha de amostras da água para análises de doenças e monitorização da temperatura da água, que atingiu os 40 graus Celsius (ºC).

“Continuamos na operação a monitorizar a temperatura do lago. No dia 28, a temperatura atingiu os 39,1°C, desceu para os 37ºC, na sexta-feira e os 32ºC, no sábado. No entanto, ontem, às 16h, subiu para os 37,8°C e estamos muito alerta. Ainda não há um avanço maior para saber a causa das mortes, mas a temperatura continua a ser o principal candidato da causa da mortalidade, disse à Agência Brasil o membro do instituto Mamirauá, Ayan Fleischmann.

Segundo Fleischmann, ainda não há uma atualização sobre o resgate dos animais ainda vivos que estão no lago. Na sexta-feira (29), o Mamirauá lançou um alerta à população que vive nas imediações do Lago Tefé para evitar o contacto com as águas do lago e também o uso recreativo.

Em entrevista ao programa Viva Maria, da Rádio Nacional da Amazónia, a coordenadora do Grupo de Pesquisa em Mamíferos Aquáticos Amazónicos do Mamirauá, Miriam Marmontel, afirmou, no sábado (30), que estes animais acabam por atuar como sentinelas da qualidade da água e são os primeiros a serem afetados com alterações provocadas no ambiente.

""Deram-nos o alerta e agora temos de estar atentos a isso. A tendência, se não mudarmos os nossos hábitos, é para estes eventos continuarem a acontecer. O aquecimento global e a alteração dos parâmetros climáticos estão a afetar um ambiente que utilizamos muito, especialmente no Amazonas. A água é primordial para os amazónidas e essa água, que atualmente não está propícia para o boto, também não é propícia para o humano”, disse a investigadora.

A decisão foi anunciada pelo ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros húngaro, Péter Szijjártó, em entrevista à televisão privada ATV, numa alusão ao fundo europeu que Budapeste bloqueia desde maio.

""Enquanto a Ucrânia não resolver esta questão, que todos se esqueçam do pagamento dos 6,6 mil milhões de euros"", afirmou.

A Hungria e a Eslováquia solicitaram na segunda-feira à Comissão Europeia a mediação com a Ucrânia, após Kiev ter incluído a petrolífera Lukoil na sua lista de sanções, implicando o fim do trânsito de petróleo para os dois países através do oleoduto Druzhba (Amizade).

O ministro sublinhou que a Hungria não apoiará o financiamento da União Europeia (UE) para o envio de armamento à Ucrânia enquanto permanecer em risco a segurança energética do país centro-europeu, que atualmente assume a presidência semestral rotativa do Conselho da UE.

""A decisão da Ucrânia de não permitir à Lukoil o trânsito de petróleo através da Ucrânia implica uma ameaça fundamental para a segurança dos fornecimentos energéticos à Hungria e à Eslováquia"", afirmou, na segunda-feira, o porta-voz do Governo húngaro, Zoltan Kovacs, na rede social X.

A Hungria e a Eslováquia dependem essencialmente das importações de petróleo russo, e apesar das sanções à Lukoil terem afetado o intercâmbio, os dois países continuam a receber fornecimentos de outras empresas russas.

O primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, e o seu homólogo eslovaco, Robert Fico, ambos definidos de ""pró-russos"", têm-se oposto ao apoio militar à Ucrânia na sequência da invasão russa e defendem uma solução negociada para terminar com o conflito.

A ofensiva militar russa no território ucraniano, lançada a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, mergulhou a Europa naquela que é considerada a crise de segurança mais grave desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945).

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais, que também têm decretado sanções contra setores-chave da economia russa para tentar diminuir a capacidade de Moscovo de financiar o esforço de guerra.

Os últimos meses foram marcados por ataques aéreos em grande escala da Rússia contra cidades e infraestruturas ucranianas, ao passo que as forças de Kiev têm visado alvos em território russo próximos da fronteira e na península da Crimeia, ilegalmente anexada em 2014.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, afirmou que os soldados ocidentais têm estado a operar na Ucrânia há muito tempo e que isso faz parte da guerra híbrida da NATO e da União Europeia (UE) contra a Rússia.

""O presidente tem apresentado, repetidamente, provas específicas de que, nas fileiras das Forças Armadas ucranianas, estão a combater militares de exércitos ocidentais, mercenários e voluntários. Existem instrutores diretos sem os quais não é possível utilizar diretamente, não só as armas ocidentais de longo alcance, mas também meios de destruição ucranianos de longo alcance, sem a ajuda dos especialistas ocidentais, sem dados de inteligência espacial - que os ucranianos certamente não têm - sem os especialistas de programação das missões de voo. Estas tropas não podem utilizar equipamentos de foguetes"", disse o ministro durante uma conferência de imprensa em Moscovo.

""Mas os militares ocidentais estão a operar na Ucrânia há muito tempo, isto faz parte da guerra híbrida da NATO e da UE contra o nosso país, sabemos bem disso"", comentou o chefe da diplomacia russa.

A Rússia lançou uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022 em resposta aos apelos de proteção das repúblicas populares de Donetsk e Lugansk (RPD e RPL) contra os bombardeamentos e ataques das tropas ucranianas. O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, disse que o seu objetivo é ""proteger as pessoas que foram submetidas a abusos e genocídio pelo regime de Kiev durante oito anos"".

""Não excluo nenhuma opção"", disse o vice-ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Serguei Riabkov, ao ser questionado sobre a possibilidade de deslocamento de mísseis nucleares caso os Estados Unidos da América (EUA) confirmem a sua decisão, acrescentando que tais ações implicam ""o fim definitivo dos acordos sobre controlo de armamento nessa zona"".

""Nesta situação, tendo em conta as capacidades combinadas dos países que são membros da NATO, devemos avaliar as nossas respostas, sem nenhuma limitação interna em termos de quê, onde e quando se devem ou não devem instalar [os mísseis]. Isso significa que as opções devem ser as mais amplas possíveis"", assinalou o responsável, citado pela agência noticiosa russa Interfax.

Nesse sentido, o vice-ministro referiu que a posição da Rússia ""não constitui uma ameaça para ninguém, apenas procura o processo mais efetivo, também em termos de custos, para responder a desafios em mutação"".

Riabkov também garantiu que as autoridades russas vão garantir a segurança do enclave russo de Kaliningrado (um enclave russo no Báltico com fronteira com a Lituânia e a Polónia, dois países da União Europeia e da NATO), que ""atrai desde há muito a atenção dos adversários"".

""Caso os representantes do Governo da Alemanha considerem justificado iniciar medidas para uma escalada sob o pretexto da situação na região, responderemos com medidas de compensação da forma que considerarmos mais aceitável"", sublinhou.

""Nada nos deterá na hora de solucionar os problemas para a nossa segurança em todo o perímetro das fronteiras russas"", frisou.

Na semana passada, Riabkov tinha considerado que ""a natureza da reação"" da Rússia -- caso os EUA decidam essa medida e que implicaria o primeiro envio norte-americano deste armamento para a Alemanha desde o final da Guerra Fria -- ""será decidida com calma e de forma profissional"".

O anúncio dos Estados Unidos e da Alemanha indica, segundo recordou hoje a agência espanhola Europa Press, que a instalação dos mísseis de longo alcance tem por objetivo demonstrar o ""compromisso"" de Washington com a NATO e uma contribuição para a ""dissuasão integrada europeia"", especificando-se que ""estas unidades convencionais de longo alcance incluirão (mísseis) SM-6, Tomahawk e armas hipersónicas de última geração, com um raio significativamente maior face aos atuais materiais terrestres na Europa"".

PT_75.txt,Other,Other,"Os F-16 chegaram à Ucrânia. Mas não chegam

Há mais de dois anos que as forças ucranianas esperavam estes reforços. Mas isto é “insuficiente”, avisou o presidente Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

A Ucrânia recebeu os seus primeiros caças F-16 ocidentais, esperados há mais de dois anos, anunciou hoje o Presidente Volodymyr Zelenskyy, mostrando-os a jornalistas e sublinhando que o seu número é “insuficiente”.

“Realizámos centenas de reuniões e negociações” com os aliados para obter estes aviões e reforçar a defesa aérea do país e “muitas vezes ouvimos as palavras ‘é impossível’ em resposta”, disse Volodymyr Zelenskyy, durante uma cerimónia num local secreto na Ucrânia, segundo avança a AFP.

“Agora é a realidade, a realidade no nosso céu. Os F-16 estão na Ucrânia”, disse.

Desde o início da invasão russa, em fevereiro de 2022, Kiev tem implorado pela entrega de F-16 na esperança de acabar com o domínio russo no ar e proteger melhor as suas cidades e militares contra incessantes bombardeamentos das forças de Moscovo.

Fabricados nos Estados Unidos, os aviões são considerados a joia da coroa na extensa lista de equipamento militar que a Ucrânia solicitou aos aliados, numa tentativa de repelir o avanço das forças russas no seu solo.

O Presidente da Ucrânia não revelou o número de aeronaves recebidas por Kiev, limitando-se a dizer que é “insuficiente”, assim como o número de pilotos ucranianos treinados no Ocidente para pilotar aquelas aeronaves.

Também não foram revelados a data de entrega e o país que forneceu este primeiro lote.

“O que é positivo é que esperamos mais F-16” e que “muitos dos nossos homens estão a ser treinados”, assegurou Zelenskyy.

Jornalistas da AFP viram pelo menos dois F-16 a sobrevoar o local durante a cerimónia.

Atrás de Volodymyr Zelenskyy, outras duas aeronaves cinzentas semelhantes a F-16 foram colocadas no solo, parcialmente cobertas por redes de camuflagem e com as caudas estampadas com o brasão nacional, o tridente.

Em meados de maio, o presidente Zelenskyy declarou, numa entrevista à AFP, que precisava de 120 a 130 destas aeronaves para alcançar a paridade com a aviação russa.",PT,['Other'],['Other'],f- chegar ucrânia chegar haver ano força ucraniano esperar reforço insuficiente avisar presidente volodymyr zelenskyy ucrânia receber primeiro caça f- ocidental esperar haver ano anunciar hoje presidente volodymyr zelenskyy mostrar os jornalista sublinhar insuficiente realizár centena reunião negociação aliado obter avião reforçar defesa aéreo país muito ouvir palavra impossível resposta dizer volodymyr zelenskyy durante cerimónia secreto ucrânia avançar afp realidade realidade céu f- ucrânia dizer início invasão russo fevereiro kiev implorar entrega f- esperança acabar domínio russo ar proteger melhor cidade militar incessante bombardeamento força Moscovo fabricar Estados Unidos avião considerar joia coroa extensa lista equipamento militar ucrânia solicitar aliado tentativa repelir avanço força russo solo presidente ucrânia revelar aeronave receber kiev limitar se insuficiente piloto ucraniano treinar ocidente pilotar aeronave revelar data entrega país fornecer lote positivo esperar f- homem treinar assegurar zelenskyy jornalistas afp ver f- sobrevoar durante cerimónia volodymyr zelenskyy aeronave cinzento semelhante f- colocar solo parcialmente cobrir rede camuflagem cauda estampadas brasão nacional tridente meado maio presidente zelenskyy declarar entrevista afp precisar de este aeronave alcançar paridade aviação russo

O nível de ódio na Europa à Rússia faz lembrar os tempos nazis e agora aqueles que se opõem ao imperialismo dos EUA devem temer pelas suas vidas, afirmou à Sputnik o deputado do Parlamento Europeu pela Eslováquia, do Partido Social-Democrata Smer, Lubos Blaha.

Ora, no Ocidente, a própria liberdade de expressão é espezinhada quando alguém se manifesta contra a guerra, diz Blaha. Segundo ele, o povo eslovaco não vê os russos como inimigos, porque lhes está agradecido pela libertação do fascismo na Segunda Guerra Mundial.

""Lamento dizê-lo, mas a verdade é que a russofobia no Ocidente continua a crescer. A atmosfera tanto no Parlamento Europeu como nos Estados-membros da União Europeia faz, por vezes, lembrar a época dos nazis nas décadas de 1930 e 1940. Vejo o mesmo ódio contra a Rússia.""

Salientou que é preciso desanuviar o conflito para evitar uma guerra nuclear, que ninguém deseja. Blaha disse, ainda, que agora é difícil ser-se contra a política imperialista norte-americana na Europa. ""Percebi que, bem, se se é contra o imperialismo norte-americano, é preciso ter medo de poder não sobreviver. E isso, realmente, não é bom para a democracia europeia ou anglo-saxónica e é por essa razão que o critico. 
É preciso ser-se forte e corajoso"", sublinha.

Acrescentou que as tentativas de assassinato de políticos como o ex-presidente dos EUA, Donald Trump, e o primeiro-ministro da Eslováquia, Robert Fico, que se têm manifestado contra a assistência incondicional a Kiev, são uma ""situação horrível"".

O próprio Blaha disse que foi a Moscovo agradecer à Rússia a libertação do fascismo e pedir desculpa pela russofobia que existe atualmente no Ocidente. O eurodeputado eslovaco pediu, ainda, que não se acredite nas mentiras que estão a ser espalhadas sobre a Rússia nos países ocidentais.

A decisão do presidente ucraniano Vladimir Zelensky de não realizar a eleição presidencial no seu país, apesar do mandato terminar dentro de dois meses, provavelmente, não terá um impacto significativo no seu relacionamento com o Ocidente, diz o analista político Bogdan Bezpalko à Sputnik.

Previstas para ocorrerem inicialmente este domingo (31), as eleições na Ucrânia foram canceladas sob o pretexto de uma lei marcial decretada pelo presidente Zelensky. Enquanto as autoridades de Kiev insistiam que esta decisão está relacionada com o conflito ucraniano iniciado em fevereiro de 2022, há suspeitas de que a decisão foi motivada pelas avaliações de Zelensky nas sondagens de opinião.

""Ele não quer realizar eleições porque teme perdê-las e que alguém ocupe o seu lugar. A Ucrânia não está em estado de guerra, a mobilização não foi oficialmente declarada, não há outros atributos associados a um país que está oficialmente em estado de guerra. A lei marcial, é claro, pode permitir que ele estenda o seu mandato, mas não indefinidamente"", disse o analista político Bogdan Bezpalko à Sputnik.

O representante permanente da Rússia na Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU), Vasily Nebenzya, já sugeriu que Zelensky deixará tecnicamente de ser um presidente legítimo assim que o seu mandato terminar a 21 de maio.

No entanto, Bezpalko observou que o mandato presidencial de Zelensky poderá ser prolongado até agosto, sem mencionar que o regime em Kiev poderá tentar encenar alguma provocação para ""alterar o estatuto judicial do conflito"" e assim alargar ainda mais a situação.

O analista acrescentou que a decisão de Zelensky dificilmente terá repercussões no Ocidente, uma vez que o atual regime em Kiev serve os interesses dos países aliados. No entanto, se por algum motivo o Ocidente decidir destituir Zelensky, seria imediatamente declarado que não ocupa o cargo de forma legítima, sugeriu Bezpalko.

Embora as potências ocidentais possam dar ""algumas declarações tímidas"" sobre a decisão de Zelensky de não realizar eleições, provavelmente não serão seguidas por quaisquer sanções ou diminuição do fluxo de assistência ocidental para Kiev, acrescentou.

""Ele pode acabar a enfrentar algumas dificuldades nos seus contactos com o Ocidente, mas continuará a receber ajuda — limitada, significativamente diminuída talvez, mas continuará a receber ajuda"", observou Bezpalko.

Segundo o especialista, a questão da legitimidade de Zelensky é uma preocupação secundária, uma vez que o substituto provavelmente não alteraria a posição da Ucrânia em relação à Rússia ou ao conflito como um todo. A razão para isto, disse, é o facto de não ser apenas a Ucrânia ou Zelensky em si que estão envolvidos no conflito com a Rússia, mas, essencialmente, todo o Ocidente.

Bezpalko observou ainda que Zelensky estabeleceu um regime autoritário na Ucrânia ao tentar negar aos seus adversários políticos o acesso aos meios de comunicação de massa e a quaisquer recursos materiais.

Além disso, o presidente é considerado responsável por arrastar a Ucrânia para um conflito que se tornou um desastre absoluto no país e Zelensky teria uma grande derrota numa eleição livre e transparente, concluiu Bezpalko.

PT_192.txt,Other,Other,"Seca em Manaus: rio Negro atinge 3º nível histórico mais baixo

O rio Negro, em Manaus, atingiu o seu terceiro nível mais baixo esta sexta-feira, dia 13, ao marcar 13,93 metros. O nível está a 28 centímetros de bater o recorde de vazante registado em 2010, quando o rio atingiu os 13,63 metros.

Com o baixo nível, a prefeitura de Manaus emitiu uma nota em que reforça a interdição da praia da Ponta Negra, fechada aos banhistas desde o dia 2 de outubro.

A decisão de interditar a praia para o banho, por motivo de segurança e de prevenção contra afogamentos, ocorre devido à proximidade entre o fim do aterro perene e o leito natural do rio, que pode apresentar alterações no terreno, como buracos, desníveis e depressões.

Na passada segunda-feira, dia 9/10, a praia recebeu um cerquite para delimitar fisicamente a zona de interdição aos banhistas, com sinalização, tendo 1,20 metros de altura e 1.500 metros de comprimento. Esta limitação física é para impedir a passagem e sensibilizar as pessoas que insistem em tomar banho no rio, no troço interditado.

As alterações climáticas alteram a paisagem em várias partes do País

O rio Negro teve uma descida muito acelerada, com uma redução de mais de 7 metros de coluna de água em apenas 20 dias, em setembro. A explicação está no fenómeno El Niño, que prolongou a intensidade da seca no Amazonas.

A capital do Amazonas decretou o estado de emergência no dia 28 de setembro por causa da seca.

Além disso, a autarquia recomendou, ainda, que a população não pratique atividades físicas. Isto porque Manaus voltou a ficar coberta por fumo.

“Recomendo a não prática de desporto. Não se pode respirar monóxido de carbono, que causa problemas. Em função disso, vamos adiar a maratona da nossa cidade, que estava programada para o fim de semana. É, também, necessário evitar ficar exposto ao fumo, fechar as janelas das casas, e a hidratação é fundamental neste momento. Infelizmente, estamos a passar por isto, fruto das alterações climáticas”, afirmou o presidente da Câmara, David Almeida.

A associação ambientalista World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) alertou hoje para setores/regiões do planeta que estão quase a entrar em rutura e diz que caso as tendências se mantenham as consequências serão “potencialmente catastróficas”.

A WWF publica anualmente um relatório sobre o estado de saúde do planeta, chamado “Índice Planeta Vivo”, e na edição deste ano, hoje divulgada, alerta para a aproximação de “pontos de viragem perigosos”.

A associação ambientalista internacional alerta que na natureza há mudanças que podem ser pequenas e graduais mas podem ter “impactos cumulativos” que vão desencadear mudanças maiores e mais rápidas, que quando atingem um limiar a mudança pode perpetuar-se sozinha, atingindo um ponto de rutura.

Há pontos de rutura globais, alerta a WWF, que são ameaças graves para a humanidade porque danificam os sistemas de suporte de vida na Terra. “Há vários pontos de rutura a nível mundial que estão a aproximar-se rapidamente”.

Segundo o relatório, um ponto de rutura pode ser a mortalidade em massa dos recifes de coral, que a acontecer destruiria a pesca e a proteção contra tempestades, e outro o da floresta tropical amazónica, que libertaria toneladas de carbono para a atmosfera perturbando os padrões climáticos do planeta.

O colapso da corrente circular a sul da Gronelândia (colapso do giro subpolar) também afetaria drasticamente o clima na Europa e América do Norte, e o derretimento dos mantos de gelo da Gronelândia e da Antártida Ocidental faria subir o nível do mar em muitos metros, além de desencadear o degelo do “permafrost” (solo gelado em permanência) em larga escala provocando grandes emissões de dióxido de carbono e metano.

Há pontos de rutura que já estão a acontecer a nível regional, diz a WWF, que exemplifica com o que se passa na América do Norte, onde a infestação de escaravelhos do pinheiro e os incêndios florestais empurram as florestas de pinheiros para a rutura, sendo substituídos por arbustos e prados.

Na Amazónia a desflorestação e alterações climáticas reduziram a chuva e o ponto de rotura será quando deixar de haver condições para a floresta tropical, com “consequências devastadoras para as pessoas, a biodiversidade e o clima global”.

“Um ponto de viragem poderia estar no horizonte se apenas 20-25% da floresta amazónica fosse destruída e estima-se que 14-17% já tenha sido desflorestada”, avisa a WWF.

A WWF é uma organização independente de conservação com mais de 38 milhões de seguidores e uma rede global ativa em mais de 100 países.

A porta-voz do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova, afirmou, esta quarta-feira, que o líder ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky não é de confiança quando fala de possíveis negociações com a Rússia.

""Ninguém tem qualquer confiança nele. Todos compreendem perfeitamente que se trata de um homem que pode distorcer tudo, que pode mentir, que pode abandonar tudo, como abandonou até o seu próprio povo, atirando literalmente o povo da Ucrânia para um altar de sacrifício"", afirmou, numa conferência de imprensa, citada pela Tass.

Na ótica de Zakharova, ""nada foi feito por ninguém"" em relação à Ucrânia, ""nem por Zelensky, nem pela sua administração ou por outros ramos do governo, nem pelos manipuladores ocidentais para revogar a lei que proíbe a Ucrânia de negociar com a Rússia"".

""Ouvimos muitas palavras, mas basicamente não vemos quaisquer atos. Bem, exceto o facto de Zelensky continuar a massacrar cidadãos ucranianos"", frisou ainda.

Zakharova sugeriu também que Zelensky e os que o apoiam ""querem fazer outra tentativa para promover a chamada fórmula de paz, que eles estão a tentar, sem sucesso"". ""Querem forçar literalmente todos, para envolver o maior número possível de países na sua discussão sob falsos pretextos"", salientou.

E continuou: ""Não há nada de novo na intenção do regime de Kyiv e dos seus manipuladores ocidentais de se reabilitarem pela chamada cimeira de paz falhada. Compreendemos que estas tentativas vão continuar. Por detrás disto está o desejo de impor a 'fórmula Zelensky', que é um beco sem saída, a um vasto leque de países"".

Recorde-se que, numa entrevista à BBC, Zelensky afirmou que as conversações com o lado russo eram possíveis, apesar do decreto em vigor na Ucrânia que proíbe essas conversações. ""Ao pressionar a Rússia, acredito que é possível chegar a um acordo diplomático. Acho que o poder da diplomacia pode ajudar"", disse o presidente ucraniano.

“Temos que tratar deles”. Presidente da Rússia está claramente incomodado com a invasão ucraniana a Kursk.

O Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, ameaçou nesta segunda-feira os soldados ucranianos que estão a atacar a região russa de Kursk desde o início de agosto, acrescentando que a ofensiva ucraniana não vai travar o avanço russo na Ucrânia.

“Temos de tratar desses bandidos que entraram no território da Rússia, na região de Kursk, e que estão a tentar desestabilizar a situação nos territórios fronteiriços como um todo”, disse Putin durante uma reunião com estudantes.

Essas observações contrastam com o discurso habitual dos responsáveis russos que, até ao momento, tentavam minimizar a ofensiva das forças ucranianas na região de Kursk, lançada a 6 de agosto.

Putin, no entanto, sublinhou que a Ucrânia “não alcançou a principal tarefa [a que] se propôs: travar a ofensiva [russa] no Donbass”, no leste ucraniano.

O exército ucraniano apanhou as forças russas desprevenidas na região de Kursk, tomando rapidamente centenas de quilómetros quadrados e dezenas de localidades, antes de ser travado.

As autoridades ucranianas alegaram que essa operação visava, entre outras coisas, forçar a Rússia a redistribuir as suas tropas no leste da Ucrânia para a região de Kursk.

Essa aposta parece perdida, tendo o exército russo, pelo contrário, acelerado o seu avanço no leste, conquistando novas aldeias quase diariamente. Hoje, os soldados russos estão a menos de dez quilómetros da cidade de Pokrovsk, um importante centro logístico para os ucranianos.

Segundo Putin, agora as tropas russas avançam vários quilómetros quadrados a cada ataque e não algumas centenas de metros como anteriormente.

“Há muito tempo que não experimentávamos tal ritmo de ofensiva no Donbass”, disse.

Quem acompanha as notícias, provavelmente, sabe o que se passa no Rio Grande do Sul. Naquele estado, um evento atmosférico de grandes proporções produziu um enorme volume de chuva e elevou o nível dos rios a níveis catastróficos para as populações locais com mortes e perdas materiais . Bairros nas margens do rio Guaíba, em Porto Alegre, ficaram submersos, o aeroporto foi fortemente afetado, assim como estádios de futebol e o centro da cidade.

Já falei neste espaço sobre a necessidade de cuidar dos rios urbanos. É importante, mas insuficiente. Perante o caso gaúcho e outros tantos a acontecer, é evidente a importância de desenvolvimento urgente de políticas e planos mais abrangentes, atentos às escalas regionais e não exclusivamente aos trechos dos recursos hídricos no interior das cidades.

Todo o rio está inscrito num sistema de drenagem denominado bacia hidrográfica. Esta unidade do território, com rios principais e afluentes, interage constantemente, com efeitos tanto a montante (nascentes) como a jusante (foz). Comumente, as bacias percorrem o território de mais do que um concelho e, por vezes, de mais do que um estado. Isto significa que os problemas a afetar uma dada cidade podem ter a sua razão decorrente das ações decorridas em áreas urbanas e rurais muito distantes.

Por exemplo, quando uma cidade com baixa capacidade de tratamento dos seus esgotos lança os resíduos no rio, as populações que vivem nas urbes a jusante recebem directamente o efeito dessa poluição.

Se houver desflorestação e o rio assoreia, o seu canal torna-se pouco profundo e a sua área de alagamento alarga-se, sendo, desta forma, capaz de alcançar territórios anteriormente inatingíveis.

Outro aspeto a considerar é a reciprocidade dos processos. A modificação desregrada dos componentes naturais da bacia hidrográfica (aterros, barragens, desflorestação, impermeabilização dos solos, etc) tende a acelerar as alterações climáticas pois os rios são decisivos nas trocas de matéria e energia entre a superfície terrestre e a atmosfera.

Por outro lado, quando as alterações climáticas geram efeitos extremos, as mesmas alterações nos rios potenciam os efeitos negativos das secas ou das cheias.

Em síntese, se as soluções propostas forem pontuais, a tendência é para a resolução parcial ou mesmo a geração de novos problemas para as cidades a jusante ou a montante. Para evitar novos impactos, são bem-vindos projetos com abrangência espacial a dar conta da totalidade das bacias hidrográficas. Recorde-se que existem os Conselhos de Bacia e já foi desenvolvida muita ciência em relação a este tema. Infelizmente, o que nos falta é uma política de integração, tanto a nível estadual como interestadual.

Não existe outra opção viável. Se os municípios, coordenados pelos governos estaduais ou da União, juntamente com as empresas e a sociedade, não iniciarem uma política partilhada de protecção das bacias hidrográficas, os jornais destinarão páginas e páginas a outros acontecimentos da magnitude do que tem acontecido no Sul do Brasil.

O primeiro-ministro grego, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, já alertou sobre um verão perigoso pela frente, salientando que a ajuda da população era essencial para limitar o impacto dos incêndios florestais: recorde-se que em 2023 morreram 20 pessoas em incêndios florestais durante os meses de verão.

A Grécia tem atravessado num passado recente marcado por diversos incêndios florestais: no entanto, o clima mais quente, seco e ventoso, que os cientistas associam aos efeitos das mudanças climáticas, aumentou a sua frequência e intensidade.

Na manhã desta segunda-feira, os serviços de emergência emitiram ordens de evacuação para as pessoas na área de Metohi, no oeste de Chios, para que se deslocassem para uma praia próxima – à noite, mais de 140 bombeiros, juntamente com oito equipas especializadas em incêndios florestais, sete aviões e três helicópteros estavam a combater o incêndio.

De acordo com o porta-voz do corpo de bombeiros, Vasilis Vathrakoyiannis, dois bombeiros ficaram levemente feridos: a televisão estatal ‘ERT’ relatou mais tarde que outros dois bombeiros e um voluntário sofreram queimaduras sem risco de vida. “A situação continua difícil em Chios, e todas as forças de Proteção Civil farão grandes esforços para limitá-la”, garantiu Vathrakoyiannis.

Mais a sul no Egeu, outro incêndio irrompeu na ilha turística de Kos, que forçou a evacuação de várias pessoas, incluindo turistas de hotéis como precaução: o incêndio foi combatido por mais de 100 bombeiros, incluindo reforços enviados de Atenas, bem como seis aviões e dois helicópteros, acrescentou Vathrakoyiannis.

A Grécia viu 52 incêndios florestais irromperem nas últimas 24 horas, 44 dos quais foram combatidos nos estágios iniciais, salientou Vathrakoyiannis: os incêndios ocorreram um dia depois de o corpo de bombeiros ter conseguido controlar dois grandes incêndios florestais perto de Atenas, que foram alimentados por ventos fortes.

“Tivemos um junho excecionalmente difícil em relação às condições climáticas, com altos níveis de seca e ventos excecionalmente fortes para esta estação”, salientou Kyriakos Mitsotakis, esta segunda-feira, acrescentado que este verão “está previsto ser particularmente perigoso” para incêndios florestais.

Clare Smith, que está de férias em Kos com o marido e a filha de 9 anos, descreveu à ‘Sky News’ que a situação “piorou significativamente” ao longo do dia, com “grossas nuvens de fumo preto”. “Está muito ventoso aqui, vai ser como um barril de pólvora. O céu está coberto de fumo e sente-se como se estivesse no apocalipse, ou em algum tipo de filme de guerra.”",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans']",incêndio apocalítico obrigar evacuação turista ilha grécia bombeiro ferir diverso turista obrigar evacuar hotel grécia devido ameaça numeroso incêndio florestal espalhar país representar acordo britânico the independent bombeiro combater incêndio ilha chio kos leste mar egeu segunda-feira ferir pessoa primeiro-ministro grego kyriakos mitsotakis alertar verão perigoso frente salientar ajuda população essencial limitar impacto incêndio florestal recordar se morrer pessoa incêndio florestal durante verão grécia atravessar passado recente marcar diverso incêndio florestal entanto clima quente seco ventoso cientista assocer efeito mudança climático aumentar frequência intensidade manhã segunda-feira serviço emergência emitir ordem evacuação pessoa metohi oeste chio deslocar praia noite bombeiro juntamente equipa especializar incêndio florestal avião helicóptero estar combater incêndio acordo porta-voz corpo bombeiro vasilis vathrakoyiannis bombeiro ficar levemente ferir televisão estatal ert relatar bombeiro voluntário sofrer queimadura risco vida situação continuar difícil chio força proteção civil fazer esforço limitar ela garantir vathrakoyiannis sul egeu outro incêndio irromper ilha turístico kos forçar evacuação várias pessoa incluir turista hotel precaução incêndio combater bombeiro incluir reforço enviar atena avião helicóptero acrescentar vathrakoyiannis grécia ver incêndio florestal irromper último hora combatir estágio inicial salientar vathrakoyiannis incêndio ocorrer dia corpo bombeiro conseguir controlar incêndio florestal atena alimentar vento forte junho excecionalmente difícil condição climática alto nível seca vento excecionalmente forte estação salientar kyriakos mitsotakis segunda-feira acrescentar ver previsto particularmente perigoso incêndio florestal clare Smith férias kos marido filha ano descrever sky news situação piorar significativamente longo dia grossa nuvem fumo preto ventoso barril pólvora céu coberto fumo sente-se estar apocalipse algum filme guerra

Um jornalista de investigação avaliou a situação em torno dos gasodutos russos, cuja investigação já foi abandonada pela Suécia e pela Dinamarca, gesto visto pelo próprio como uma tentativa de ocultar a verdade.

Na segunda-feira (26), a Dinamarca tornou-se o segundo país europeu a encerrar oficialmente a sua investigação sobre a explosão nos gasodutos Nord Stream 1 (Corrente do Norte 1) e Nord Stream 2 (Corrente do Norte 2).

O Nord Stream tem desempenhado um papel crucial no abastecimento da indústria alemã e no fornecimento de energia de baixo custo em toda a Europa.

Os observadores culparam imediatamente os Estados Unidos pelo acontecimento, que ocorreu em setembro de 2022, destacando a promessa enigmática de Joe Biden, presidente dos EUA, de ""pôr um ponto final"" ao projeto se a Rússia colocasse as suas tropas na Ucrânia em resposta à opressão da população russófona de Donbass. O inquérito da Dinamarca apurou mesmo que as explosões foram um ato de ""sabotagem deliberada"", mas as autoridades recusaram-se a investigar quem era o responsável.

Antes disso, no início do mês, a Suécia encerrou a sua própria investigação.

""É uma farsa absoluta"", disse na quarta-feira (28) o jornalista de investigação Dan Lazare.

«Não sei por quanto mais tempo isto pode continuar. Quer dizer, a Dinamarca investigou, chegou a uma conclusão, e toda a gente sabe que foi obviamente uma sabotagem — isto era óbvio desde o início. E [a Dinamarca] abstém-se de apontar o dedo a um provável culpado.""

Disse estar 100% convencido de que ""os Estados Unidos"" são os culpados e de que ""Dinamarca, Suécia, toda a gente tem medo de dizer isto. É extraordinário"".

Lazare vê a situação beneficiar os partidos de extrema-direita de todo o continente, como a Alternativa para a Alemanha (AfD, na sigla alemã), que são os únicos dispostos a reconhecer abertamente o papel dos EUA no ato.

""Portanto, se a AfD está a subir nas sondagens, têm de agradecer a Joe Biden, porque Joe Biden fez explodir o gasoduto, e toda a gente tem medo de o admitir"", concluiu Lazare, mencionando também Donald Trump nos EUA, Marine Le Pen em França, Geert Wilders nos Países Baixos e Giorgia Meloni em Itália.

""O centro está a autodestruir-se e praticamente agora está a introduzir a extrema-direita para ocupar o seu lugar"", disse, prevendo que os legisladores do sistema ""pagarão um preço terrível, terrível por encobrir isto [a sabotagem do Nord Stream]"".

Ao mesmo tempo, indica, ""as consequências políticas teriam sido terríveis"" se os líderes reconhecessem publicamente a responsabilidade dos Estados Unidos pela sabotagem do Nord Stream.

""Quando as pessoas admitem o que aconteceu, a NATO [Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte] vai basicamente pelos ares, porque uma aliança não é um esquema para um membro atacar outro"", afirmou.

""É um pacto de defesa mútua, e os EUA violaram-no em grande escala. Esta [sabotagem] do Nord Stream é um acontecimento que terá repercussões durante décadas. É uma explosão no coração da aliança ocidental — destruirá completamente a aliança ocidental. Não há como a NATO sobreviver a este golpe quando este se tornar demasiado grande para ser ignorado"", deixou claro Dan Lazare.

PT_136.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"O passado domingo foi o dia mais quente já registado no mundo, diz observatório europeu

O passado domingo, 21 de julho, foi o dia mais quente de que há registo a nível global, de acordo com os dados preliminares do Serviço de Alterações Climáticas Copernicus, da União Europeia.

A temperatura média do ar à superfície do planeta no domingo atingiu os 17,09°C —um pouco acima do recorde anterior, de 6 de julho do ano passado, de 17,08°C.

As ondas de calor atingiram grandes áreas dos Estados Unidos, Europa e Rússia na última semana.

O observatório Copernicus confirmou à agência Reuters que o recorde de temperatura média diária estabelecido no ano passado parece ter sido batido no domingo, de acordo com os seus registos, que remontam a 1940.

Segundo o Copernicus, o novo recorde diário pode ser ultrapassado nos próximos dias. As temperaturas devem descer a seguir, mas são esperadas ainda flutuações nas próximas semanas.

""O que realmente surpreende é a magnitude da diferença entre a temperatura dos últimos 13 meses e os recordes anteriores. Estamos em território desconhecido e, à medida que o clima aquece, vamos certamente bater novos recordes nos próximos meses e anos"", prevê Carlo Buontempo, diretor do departamento de alterações climáticas do Copernicus (conhecido pela sigla C3S).

Todos os meses desde junho de 2023 —ou seja, 13 meses consecutivos— foram classificados como os mais quentes do planeta desde o início dos registos, em comparação com o mês correspondente nos anos anteriores, disse o Copernicus.

No ano passado, quatro dias consecutivos bateram o recorde, de 3 a 6 de julho, em consequência das alterações climáticas provocadas pelas atividades humanas, sobretudo a queima de combustíveis fósseis. Em 2023, este quadro levou a dias de calor extremo em todo o hemisfério norte.

Antes de julho de 2023, o recorde da temperatura média mundial diária tinha sido de 16,8°C, a 13 de agosto de 2016, segundo o observatório europeu. Desde 3 de julho de 2023, 57 dias ultrapassaram este índice.

Alguns cientistas apontam que 2024 poderá superar 2023 como o ano mais quente de que há registo, uma vez que as alterações climáticas e o fenómeno climático natural El Niño —que terminou em abril— fizeram subir ainda mais as temperaturas este ano.

O observatório Copernicus, no entanto, é cauteloso ao comentar esta possibilidade. ""Por enquanto, 2024 está suficientemente quente para que o ano inteiro"" bata o recorde, disse o serviço europeu, ""mas o calor excecional registado nos últimos quatro meses de 2023 faz com que ainda seja demasiado cedo [para prever]"".

Amanhã vão a tribunal

Os 11 ativistas climáticos do movimento Climáximo, que esta terça-feira de manhã encetaram um boqueio à Segunda Circular, em Lisboa, a partir das 9 horas, em plena hora de ponta, em três das quatro faixas de rodagem no sentido Benfica-Aeroporto, já foram libertados pelas autoridades, após terem sido detidos no protesto.

Os jovens foram libertados pelas 17h00 da esquadra da PSP e Benfica, onde se encontravam detidos. À saída, contavam-se alguns familiares e colegas do movimento, que bateram palvas e gritaram novas palavras de ordem, pedindo ação do Governo para travar as alterações climáticas. Exibiu-se um cartaz que dizia “Estão a destruir tudo o que tu amas”.

“Fogos, cheias, secas, ondas de calor que matam mihares de pessoas. Eles sabem isso e continuam a aumentar as emissões. Precisamos de paz e de um desarmamento das armas que têm apontadas a todos nós”, disse Noah Zino, um dos ativistas.

Os ativistas serão amanhã presentes a juiz, pelas 10h00, no Campus de Justiça, em Lisboa. Dizendo que ainda não conheciam os crimes de que estavam acusados, admitem que o mais provável é que respondam por desobediência e perturbação da ordem pública.

“Parámos de consentir com uma normalidade que mata mais pessoas a cada dois dias do que o que morreram em Pedrogão Grande, ns incêndios. Acompanharemos quem queira parar com este genocídio”, continuou o ativista, assegurando que ações deste género continuarão a acontecer.

Nove dos ativistas detidos, que tinham estado a cortar a Segunda Circular, foram levados por uma viatura da unidade especial da polícia, sendo que os dois pendurados no viaduto acabaram por ser retirados pelas autoridades, em particular os Bombeiros Sapadores de Lisboa, e detidos.

Foram mobilizados para o local várias ambulância do INEM, dois carros dos Sapadores Bombeiros de Lisboa com mais de 10 operacionais, quatro carros da unidade especial de polícia e cinco operacionais da Equipa de Prevenção e Reação Imediata (EPRI) do comando metropolitano da PSP de Lisboa.

Recorde aqui os vídeos do protesto e do caos esta manhã em Lisboa:

Nas redes sociais, o grupo publicou diversos vídeos sobre o momento, inclusive quando a polícia foi obrigada a intervir para retirar dois protestantes pendurados por uma corda no viaduto da 2ª Circular, no qual empunhavam uma faixa onde se lia “os governos e as empresas declararam guerra à sociedade e ao planeta”.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",ativista bloquear circular acabar deter libertar amanhã tribunal ativista climático movimento climáximo terça-feira manhã encetar boqueio circular Lisboa hora pleno hora ponta faixa rodagem sentido benfica-aeroporto libertar autoridade ter ser deter protesto jovem libertar esquadra psp Benfica encontrar detido saída contavamr se familiar colega movimento bater palva gritar palavra ordem pedir ação governo travar alteração climática exibiur se cartaz dizer destruir ama fogo cheia seco Ondas calor matar mihar pessoa saber continuar aumentar emissão precisamo paz desarmamento arma apontar dizer noah zino ativista ativista ser amanhã presente juiz campus justiça Lisboa dizer conhec crime estar acusado admiter provável respondar desobediência perturbação ordem público parár consentir normalidade matar pessoa dia morrer pedrogão ns incêndio acompanharemos querer parar genocídio continuar ativista assegurar ação género continuar acontecer ativista deter ter cortar circular levar viatura unidade especial polícia ser pendurado viaduto acabar retirar autoridade particular bombeiro sapador Lisboa deter mobilizar várias ambulância inem carro sapador bombeiro Lisboa operacional carro unidade especial polícia operacional equipa prevenção reação imediato Epri comando metropolitano psp Lisboa recorde vídeo protesto caos manhã Lisboa rede social publicar diverso vídeo polícia intervir retirar protestante pendurar corda viaduto circular empunhar faixa liar governo empresa declarar guerra sociedade planeta

Os Estados Unidos estão a encobrir os responsáveis pelo ataque terrorista à sala de concertos russa do Crocus City Hall, denunciou o Serviço de Informações Externas russo.

""Os norte-americanos estão a proteger os responsáveis pelo ataque terrorista ao Crocus City Hall"", afirmou a organização, citada pela sua assessoria de imprensa.

Segundo a nota, ""o Serviço de Informações Externas da Federação Russa informa que a administração [do presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden] está a intensificar os seus esforços para criar uma imagem distorcida do grande ataque terrorista ocorrido na Rússia no dia 22 de março"".

Washington começou também a encobrir o presidente ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, logo após o ataque, acrescenta o texto.

O Departamento de Estado dos EUA, os seus serviços especiais e organizações afiliadas foram encarregues de ""eliminar qualquer tipo de suspeita que a comunidade internacional tenha sobre o envolvimento de Zelensky e do seu círculo mais próximo no crime"".

As agências norte-americanas estão a tentar convencer os seus aliados de que é o grupo Daesh (organização terrorista proibida na Rússia e noutros países) que está por trás do ataque nos arredores de Moscovo, informou a inteligência russa.

'Uma guerra terrorista contra a Rússia'

Segundo a declaração, o atual governo de Kiev está a travar uma guerra terrorista total contra a Rússia.

""O regime de Kiev tem travado uma guerra terrorista de pleno direito contra a Rússia já há algum tempo, como afirmam abertamente os seus representantes, como Kirill Budanov [chefe da Inteligência Militar ucraniana] e Vasily Malyuk [chefe do Serviço de Segurança ucraniano]"", refere o texto.

No domingo (31), o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo informou ter enviado às autoridades ucranianas exigências de detenção e extradição de todas as pessoas envolvidas no ataque à Câmara Municipal de Crocus e noutros ataques ocorridos nos últimos anos.

O ministério mencionou os assassinatos dos jornalistas Daria Dugina e Vladlen Tatarsky, sublinhando que as investigações ""indicam que os vestígios de todos estes crimes levam à Ucrânia"".

PT_170.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Amazónia terá recuperação lenta por fenómenos cllimáticos

O coordenador-geral de Ciências da Terra do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE), Gilvan Sampaio, diz que o sudoeste da Amazónia voltará a receber chuva a partir de novembro, mas a precipitação será inferior à média e possivelmente a recuperação será lenta.

“O défice de chuva foi muito grande, ainda terá reflexos em novembro e vai recuperando pouco a pouco”, afirmou.

Por influência do El Niño, segundo o mesmo, as chuvas serão superiores à média no Sul e, aliadas à anomalia de temperatura do Atlântico Norte, os volumes de precipitação serão inferiores à média na região Norte do Brasil nos próximos meses.

Diz que, para a Rondónia, a perspetiva é de manter chuvas abaixo da média. “É nesta área que está a bacia do rio Madeira, que tem um contributo importante para o rio Amazonas”, explicou.

O Madeira é o principal afluente do Amazonas. Os caudais naturais em Porto Velho (RO) apresentam valores 51% abaixo da média em outubro.

Investigador vê relação entre seca no Rio Negro e aquecimento global

Os dados constam dos mapas do boletim conjunto do INPE, do Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia (INMET) e do Funceme.

Na passada sexta-feira (27), o diretor-geral do INPE, Clézio De Nardin, explicou a situação aos senadores numa sessão dedicada para debater os efeitos nos fenómenos climáticos como o El Niño.

“Há uma seca muito grave no oeste da Amazónia e vai estender-se para o leste. Hoje em Manaus e vai para o Pará. É grave”, alertou.

Explicou que os dados indicam que o Nordeste vai sofrer com a seca a partir de fevereiro, março e abril.

“Preparem-se! O Nordeste vai sofrer com chuvas muito abaixo da média. Isto já motiva os organismos a tomarem as ações adequadas de prevenção, principalmente social”, alertou.

Os dados do INPE indicam o maior aumento de temperatura já registado no Atlântico Norte, o que inibe o crescimento da transpiração na Amazónia.

“O ciclo de crescimento da temperatura do Atlântico Norte leva as correntes e quando chega em cima da Amazónia força a corrente de ar para baixo evitando a formação de nuvens, evitando as chuvas e isso provoca as secas”, explicou.

A isto juntam-se as correntes do El Niño. Com parte do Pacífico aquecido, os ventos do oceano que seguem na direção Este-Oeste sobre a Cordilheira dos Andes formam uma espécie de barreira sobre o território brasileiro, fazendo com que as frentes frias circulem mais lentamente sobre a região Sul.

“As correntes frias entram muito lentamente na região Sul provocando chuvas extremas e muito abaixo da média no resto do país”, afirmou.

O diretor destacou o investimento de cerca de 32,7 milhões de euros por parte do Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação (MCTI) na Renovação da Infraestrutura de Supercomputação do INPE.

Os recursos do Fundo Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (FNDCT) serão aplicados na aquisição do novo supercomputador, na instalação de uma central fotovoltaica para suprir a procura energética da máquina e no desenvolvimento do Monan – Modelo para Previsão dos Oceanos, Superfícies Continentais e Atmosfera .

O sistema único de modelação de dados que recebe as informações de satélites, dados de radares e de outros sistemas de medição para realizar as previsões de tempo, do comportamento dos oceanos, dos ventos, entre outros.

Os níveis dos três principais gases com efeito de estufa que contribuem para o aquecimento global - dióxido de carbono (CO2), metano (CH4) e óxido nitroso (N2O) - voltaram a aumentar no ano passado, segundo o relatório divulgado hoje pela Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM).

A agência da ONU constatou que o CO2 está a acumular-se mais rapidamente do que nunca na atmosfera, aumentando mais de 10% em duas décadas, sendo que o dióxido de carbono contribui para 64% do aquecimento global e provém principalmente da queima de combustíveis fósseis.

“Mais um ano. Mais um recorde. Isto deveria fazer soar o alarme entre os decisores políticos. Estamos claramente atrasados em relação ao objetivo estabelecido no Acordo de Paris sobre o Clima de 2015”, afirmou a Secretária-Geral da OMM, Celeste Saulo, durante a apresentação do relatório.

Em 2015, os países concordaram em limitar o aquecimento global a menos de 2°C acima dos níveis pré-industriais, e até a 1,5°C, se possível. No entanto, os investigadores mostram uma realidade oposta.

Em 2023, as temperaturas globais em terra e no mar já foram “as mais elevadas de que há registo”, com os níveis de dióxido de carbono a registarem um aumento de 151% em relação aos níveis pré-industriais, ou seja, antes de 1750.

Foram também medidas 1934 partes por mil milhões de metano e 336,9 partes por mil milhões de óxido nitroso, os outros dois gases responsáveis pelo aquecimento global, com níveis que representam um aumento de 265% e 125%, respetivamente, em relação à era pré-industrial.

Enquanto as emissões continuarem, os gases com efeito de estufa continuarão a acumular-se na atmosfera, aumentando as temperaturas, lamenta a OMM, que divulga o seu relatório duas semanas antes do arranque da próxima cimeira das Nações Unidas sobre o clima (CIP29), que se irá realizar entre 11 e 22 de novembro em Baku, no Azerbaijão.

O relatório reitera que a última vez que a Terra teve uma concentração de dióxido de carbono comparável à atual foi entre três e cinco milhões de anos atrás, quando a temperatura era dois a três graus mais quente e o nível do mar era 10 a 20 centímetros mais alto do que é hoje.

A agência meteorológica da ONU adverte que, mesmo que as emissões fossem rapidamente reduzidas a zero (ou seja, atenuadas por fenómenos de absorção como as florestas), seriam necessárias décadas para o clima da Terra voltar reduzir os níveis atuais de temperatura, devido à longa permanência do CO2 na atmosfera.

A OMM alerta ainda para o risco de o aumento das concentrações dos gases - que provocam o aquecimento global - se tornar mais intenso.

“Os incêndios florestais podem libertar mais emissões de carbono para a atmosfera, enquanto o aumento da temperatura dos oceanos pode reduzir a sua capacidade de absorção de CO2, o que pode levar a uma maior acumulação de CO2 na atmosfera e acelerar o aquecimento global”, afirmou por seu turno Ko Barrett, secretário-geral adjunto da OMM.

A tomada do parlamento ucraniano pelos militares do país não seria um movimento popular, disse o especialista Aleksandr Dudchak à Sputnik, sugerindo que uma potencial rebelião foi orquestrada a partir do Ocidente.

Os desiludidos militares ucranianos estão a planear assumir o controlo da Suprema Rada (parlamento ucraniano), revela uma troca de mensagens de um canal privado do Telegram chamado ParaBelum, obtida pela Sputnik.

""Este poderia ser um cenário de substituição do presidente ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, sem a realização de eleições"", disse Aleksandr Dudchak, investigador do Instituto dos Países da Comunidade dos Estados Independentes (CEI) e especialista do movimento ""Outra Ucrânia"", à Sputnik.

Os membros do canal confidencial, composto por comandantes e soldados de unidades de elite das Forças Armadas ucranianas, discutiam opções para derrubar o atual governo e o seu comando militar após a demissão do então comandante-chefe, o general Valery Zaluzhny.

""A ação mais importante que precisaremos de realizar rapidamente é a tomada da VR [Suprema Rada] num determinado momento"", escreveu um dos participantes do chat.

Os membros manifestaram ainda insatisfação com as decisões de Zelensky e do novo comandante-chefe das Forças Armadas ucranianas, Aleksandr Syrsky, que foi nomeado há um mês para substituir Zaluzhny. Os alegados conspiradores golpistas deram especial ênfase ao envolvimento das tropas ucranianas que combatem na linha da frente no movimento anti-Zelensky.

Segundo o investigador Dudchak, o envolvimento de pessoal ucraniano em serviço ativo está repleto de riscos, uma vez que aqueles que estão nas trincheiras são monitorizados de perto por mercenários estrangeiros de ""destacamentos de contenção"" com ordens para disparar sobre qualquer um que abandone as suas posições.

Se as tropas ucranianas forem autorizadas a marchar em direção a Kiev, isso significaria que o cenário de mudança de regime foi escrito em Washington em resposta à recusa de Zelensky em realizar eleições este ano, argumentou Dudchak.

Os líderes das unidades de elite ucranianas, o Serviço de Segurança da Ucrânia (SBU, na sigla em ucraniano) e os batalhões nacionalistas Azov e Aidar (organizações nazis terroristas, proibidas na Rússia) também estão alegadamente a planear criar um partido radical com uma ala militar.

O especialista insiste que nenhuma das estruturas militares e de inteligência ucranianas é independente, defendendo que cada uma delas tem ""supervisores"" britânicos ou norte-americanos.

""O confronto entre os militares e o regime de Kiev é, em geral, uma manifestação do confronto entre Londres e Washington"", disse Dudchak. ""O gabinete do presidente está sob controlo britânico, enquanto os militares, que supostamente vão reunir-se em nome de Zaluzhny, estão sob o controlo dos norte-americanos, e a SBU é também uma estrutura apoiada pelos EUA.""

As consequências para Kiev seriam dramáticas e poderiam complicar seriamente as posições dos militares ucranianos na linha da frente, concluiu o investigador.

Putin ameaça com armas nucleares contra potências ""agressoras""

“Foi proposto considerar a agressão contra a Rússia por um país não nuclear, mas com a participação ou apoio de um país nuclear, como um ataque conjunto contra a Federação Russa”, afirmou na quarta-feira Putin, numa clara referência à Ucrânia, que tem pedido autorização aos Estados Unidos e outros países ocidentais para usar mísseis fornecidos por estes em ataques contra território russo.

A decisão de mudar a doutrina nuclear russa surge como resposta do Kremlin aos debates dos Estados Unidos e do Reino Unido sobre a possibilidade de permitir que a Ucrânia, que é um Estado não nuclear, possa usar contra território russo mísseis convencionais fornecidos pelos países ocidentais. Num discurso no Conselho de Segurança da Rússia, na quarta-feira, o líder russo clarificou que as alterações da retórica nuclear surgem num contexto global que tem criado novas ameaças e riscos para o país.“Vemos que a situação militar e política atual está a mudar dinamicamente e devemos ter isso em consideração. Incluindo o aparecimento de novas fontes de ameaças e riscos militares para a Rússia e os nossos aliados”, acrescentou.

""As condições para o uso de armas nucleares pela Rússia também estão claramente definidas"", afirmou ainda, acrescentando que Moscovo consideraria tal necessidade se detetasse a preparação de um lançamento massivo de mísseis, aeronaves ou drones contra o território.

Putin avisou também que poderá usar armas nucleares se a aliada Bielorrússia for alvo de agressão, incluindo armas convencionais. Nas palavras do presidente russo, estas mudanças na retórica são proporcionais às novas ameaças militares que a Federação Russa enfrenta.

As armas nucleares do país são ""a garantia mais importante de segurança do nosso Estado e dos seus cidadãos"", disse o líder do Kremlin. Citada pela agência noticiosa AP, a versão revista do documento prevê mais pormenorizadamente as condições de uso de armas nucleares, como em caso de um forte ataque aéreo envolvendo aviões, mísseis de cruzeiro ou drones. Já a 12 de setembro, Putin tinha advertido que uma autorização dos países ocidentais à Ucrânia para ataques com mísseis de longo alcance contra território russo significaria que “os países da NATO estão em guerra com a Rússia”.

“Se esta decisão for tomada, significará nada menos do que o envolvimento direto dos países da NATO na guerra na Ucrânia”, advertiu, na altura, Putin. “Isso mudaria a própria natureza do conflito. Significaria que os países da NATO estão em guerra com a Rússia”.

O chefe de gabinete do presidente ucraniano já reagiu a estas declarações e rejeitou a nova doutrina nuclear. “A Rússia não tem mais nenhum instrumento para intimidar o mundo além da chantagem nuclear. Esses instrumentos não funcionarão”, disse Andriy Yermak.

Não é a primeira vez que Putin ameaça usar armas nucleares. Mas a Ucrânia tem considerado isso como ""barulho de sabre nuclear"" para dissuadir os aliados a fornecer mais apoio.

Também a China, aliada da Rússia, já advertiu Putin contra o uso de armas nucleares.

MNE russo alerta EUA para 'não brincarem com o fogo'

Moscovo está a avisar Washington e os seus aliados ""a não brincarem com o fogo"" e a não destruírem completamente o regime da Convenção sobre Armas Químicas (CWC, na sigla inglesa), disse a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Maria Zakharova.

Esta segunda-feira (7), comentando informações sobre uma provocação iminente com recurso a produtos químicos tóxicos ""com a assistência ativa dos países ocidentais"", a representante disse que a Rússia continuará a informar a comunidade mundial relativamente às violações das disposições da CWC por parte da Ucrânia.

O chefe das Tropas de Defesa Radiológica, Química e Biológica das Forças Armadas da Rússia, tenente-general Igor Kirillov, disse anteriormente que Kiev está a preparar uma provocação para acusar a Rússia de utilizar substâncias tóxicas.

Zakharova anunciou, ainda, a provocação iminente, referindo que ""os materiais alegadamente fabricados perto da linha de contacto de combate, à semelhança da Síria, serão transferidos para especialistas internacionais que chegaram prontamente à Ucrânia"".

""O objetivo desta ação é claro. Não existe nenhuma norma de direito internacional que detenha os países da NATO do seu desejo de alcançar a declarada 'derrota estratégica' da Rússia, especialmente quando falamos do formato das provocações químicas [...] que vêm sendo elaboradas há anos na Síria [...]. Alertámos que Washington e os seus satélites não devem brincar com o fogo para não destruir completamente o regime da CWC, construído desde 1997"", disse a representante.

O acesso a 14 aldeias na região de Belgorod, no sul da Rússia, na fronteira com a Ucrânia, vai estar fechado à maioria dos civis, disse o governador Vyacheslav Gladkov, esta terça-feira, citando a situação ""extremamente difícil"" devido aos bombardeamentos ucranianos.

Ao anunciar as novas restrições num vídeo publicado no seu canal de Telegram, Gladkov disse que, a partir da próxima semana, apenas os homens adultos que acompanhem militares ou funcionários do governo terão permissão para entrar nos locais. Os homens devem viajar em veículos blindados e usar coletes à prova de bala e capacetes, acrescentou.

""Espero que concordem que é inaceitável permitir que mulheres e crianças entrem nos colonatos que são bombardeados todos os dias"", disse Gladkov.

""Já perdemos muitos civis, temos muitos feridos. E, claro, a nossa tarefa é maximizar as medidas de segurança.""

A região de Belgorod está sob fogo frequente de bombardeamentos ucranianos e drones.

As sirenes de ataque aéreo tocam quase diariamente na capital regional com o mesmo nome, a apenas 40 km a norte da fronteira.

A Ucrânia diz que o bombardeamento russo nas cidades ucranianas tem sido devastador e, após quase dois anos e meio de guerra, as forças russas estão agora no controlo de cerca de um quinto da Ucrânia.

O Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, disse em maio que as forças russas estão a trabalhar para criar uma zona tampão no nordeste da Ucrânia para proteger a Rússia dos ataques lançados pelas forças de Kiev do outro lado da fronteira.

O anúncio de Gladkov é um sinal de que a situação de segurança na região pode ter-se tornado mais grave, levando as autoridades a fazer mais para proteger a população civil.

Mais de 200 civis foram mortos na região de Belgorod desde o início do que Moscovo chama a sua ""operação militar especial"" na Ucrânia, em fevereiro de 2022, disse Gladkov à agência de notícias estatal Tass esta terça-feira. Mais de 1.100 ficaram feridos.

A Coreia do Sul convocou o embaixador da Rússia em Seul esta segunda-feira, 21, para denunciar a decisão de Pyongyang de enviar milhares de soldados para apoiar Moscovo na sua guerra na Ucrânia e pediu a ""retirada imediata"" dos militares.

Segundo a agência de inteligência sul-coreana, a Coreia do Norte decidiu enviar até 12 mil soldados para ajudar a Rússia. Quase 1500 soldados das forças especiais norte-coreanas já estão na Rússia e devem ser transferidos para a frente de batalha em breve, segundo a mesma fonte.

O vice-ministro das Relações Exteriores da Coreia do Sul, Kim Hong-kyun, expressou as ""graves preocupações"" de Seul sobre o recente envio de tropas norte-coreanas à Rússia e pediu a ""retirada imediata"" e o ""fim da cooperação neste âmbito"", informou o ministério em comunicado.

O vice-ministro disse ao embaixador russo na Coreia do Sul, Georgy Zinoviev, que o fornecimento de armas e tropas de Pyongyang à Rússia ""constitui uma ameaça considerável à segurança, não apenas da Coreia do Sul, mas também da comunidade internacional"".

As ações, alertou, ""violam muitas resoluções do Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas e da Carta das Nações Unidas"".

O embaixador Zinoviev destacou que ""a cooperação entre Rússia e Coreia do Norte acontece no âmbito do direito internacional e não é direcionada contra os interesses de segurança da República da Coreia"", informou a embaixada russa em comunicado.

A NATO, que não confirmou a presença de tropas norte-coreanas, advertiu que a medida representaria ""uma escalada significativa"" no conflito.

""Conversei com o presidente sul-coreano (Yoon Suk Yeol) sobre a colaboração estreita entre a NATO e Seul"", escreveu o secretário-geral da organização, Mark Rutte, na rede social X.

""O envio de tropas pela Coreia do Norte para combater com a Rússia na Ucrânia representaria uma escalada significativa"", acrescentou.

As relações entre Pyongyang e Seul pioraram nos últimos meses e a Coreia do Norte, que possui armamento nuclear, aproximou-se da Rússia, aliada do regime norte-coreano desde a sua fundação, após a Segunda Guerra Mundial.

Coreia do Sul e Estados Unidos da America afirmam há vários meses que o líder norte-coreano Kim Jong Un envia para a Rússia parte das armas que são utilizadas na Ucrânia.

O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, fez uma visita incomum a Pyongyang em junho, quando os dois países assinaram um tratado de defesa mútua - os detalhes do acordo não foram revelados.

PT_59.txt,CC: Downplaying climate change,CC: Downplaying climate change: Other,"Atenção ao El Niño e às anomalias do oceano. Veio tarde mas o verão está aí: agosto vai ser quente

O mês de agosto começa a aproximar-se mas o verão parece continuar distante. Pedro Sousa, meteorologista do Instituto Português do Mar e da Atmosfera (IPMA) confirma que, esta semana, “estamos a presenciar um episódio de tempo quente” e, na semana passada, também “ocorreram alguns”. O calor que se está a sentir no final de julho é “relativamente normal” e o meteorologista classifica estes períodos como o típico “calor de verão”.

“Sem recordes e sem episódios de calor muito prolongados, tem sido um verão calmo”, admite o meteorologista. E é, de facto, assim, até porque muitas têm sido as queixas de que o calor chegou tarde.

Para agosto apontam-se temperaturas acima da média no interior e abaixo da média no litoral, indica Pedro Sousa. As semanas preveem-se, assim, secas e quentes, com tendências mais frescas no litoral.

“A probabilidade de agosto ser quente é grande”, explica, devido à tendência de aquecimento global ao longo dos anos e ainda o fenómeno El Niño que, “sempre que acontece, o planeta apresenta temperaturas elevadas”. Além disso, existem anomalias do oceano acima do normal o que faz com que o mar esteja mais quente, o que também diminui a influência da brisa marítima na temperatura.

Apesar disso, o meteorologista do IPMA alerta que esta não é uma certeza absoluta, uma vez que “as previsões vão perdendo fiabilidade” e uma “previsão para daqui a três semanas pode sempre mudar”. “As previsões mudam rapidamente”, conclui.

Comparando a temperatura do mês de agosto de 2024 com as últimas três décadas, sublinha, a meteorologia do próximo mês deve ser superior, mas “nada garante que vai ser mais quente do que o ano passado ou 2018”, que foram marcados por fenómenos de temperatura.

“As temperaturas previstas e observadas são superiores aos últimos trinta anos, o que não quer dizer que sejam muito elevadas”, esclarece.

O final de julho e a primeira semana de agosto preveem-se quentes e secos com o interior acima da média e anomalias negativas no litoral. “O normal de verão”, diz o especialista.

PT_332.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Municípios em calamidade podem ganhar prioridade para receber alimentos do PAA

Projeto que prioriza a distribuição de produtos do Programa de Aquisição de Alimentos (PAA) a municípios em situação de emergência ou de calamidade pública foi aprovado de forma terminativa na Comissão de Agricultura (CRA) esta quarta-feira (14). O PL 2.708/2024, do senador Alan Rick (União-AC), recebeu parecer favorável do senador Hamilton Mourão (Republicanos-RS) e, caso não haja pedido para votação em Plenário, seguirá diretamente para análise da Câmara dos Deputados.

A proposta modifica a Lei 14.628, de 2023, que instituiu o Programa de Aquisição de Alimentos. Mantido pelo governo federal, o PPA faz a compra direta de alimentos aos agricultores familiares e destina-os a pessoas em situação de insegurança alimentar e nutricional, bem como à rede socioassistencial, aos equipamentos públicos de segurança alimentar e nutricional e às redes públicas e filantrópicas de ensino. O objetivo do programa é incentivar a agricultura e a pecuária familiar, principalmente em comunidades em situação de pobreza ou de pobreza extrema, e reduzir a insegurança alimentar.

Na justificação do projeto, o senador Alan Rick salienta que os desastres climáticos, como as chuvas abundantes no Sul e as secas severas no Norte, estão a tornar-se mais frequentes no Brasil, o que traz consequências para os residentes destas regiões, sobretudo os mais pobres, e também para os agricultores, entre os quais os pequenos produtores são os mais afetados. Por isso, considera urgente criar medidas que garantam o apoio aos mais vulneráveis ​​a situações de emergência ou de calamidade pública. Como exemplo, refere o seu estado, o Acre:

“Há décadas que é afetado por desastres climáticos como inundações e secas, que impactam todos os seus concelhos, sobretudo aqueles que concentram a produção agrícola que é distribuída pelo estado. Isto afeta não só os produtores, mas toda a população acreana e a economia local”, explica.

“A humanidade está perante um futuro intolerável”, diz secretário-geral da ONU.

É possível que quase cinco vezes mais pessoas morram devido ao calor extremo nas próximas décadas, afirmou um grupo de especialistas internacionais num relatório publicado na passada quarta-feira (15). Acrescentaram, ainda, que, caso nada seja feito em relação às alterações climáticas, a “saúde da humanidade corre um sério risco”.

Esta investigação é um resultado de uma colaboração internacional de 1145 cientistas de 52 centros de investigação e agências da ONU de todo o mundo. Monitorizam os impactos das alterações climáticas na saúde e o relatório é publicado anualmente pela revista científica ‘The Lancert’, a mais importante sobre medicina.

Segundo os especialistas, no cenário previsto de um aumento da temperatura global de 2ºC até ao final do século (que estaria em curso para atingir os 2,7ºC até 2100), prevê-se que as mortes anuais relacionadas com o calor aumentem 370% até 2050. Isto representa um aumento de 4,7 vezes, de acordo com a edição de 2023 do documento.

A investigação aponta que secas mais comuns colocarão milhões de pessoas em risco de morrer de fome, os mosquitos, que se espalham mais longe do que o normal, levarão doenças infecciosas e os sistemas de saúde terão dificuldades em lidar com o aumento sem precedentes de doentes.

Esta avaliação preocupante aconteceu durante o momento em que se espera que 2023 seja o ano mais quente da história da humanidade. Na semana passada, inclusive, o monitor climático europeu declarou que outubro foi o mais quente de que se tem registado até agora.

Ainda de acordo com o estudo, no ano passado, pessoas em todo o mundo foram expostas a uma média de 86 dias de temperaturas potencialmente fatais. Aproximadamente 60% destes dias foram duas vezes mais prováveis de ocorrer por causa das alterações climáticas. A estimativa de pessoas com mais de 65 anos que morreram devido ao calor aumentou 85% entre 1991-2000 e 2013-2022.

O secretário-geral da ONU, António Guterres, respondeu ao relatório dizendo que “a humanidade está perante um futuro intolerável”.

""Estamos já a assistir a uma catástrofe humana a desenrolar-se, com a saúde e os meios de subsistência de milhares de milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo ameaçados por um calor recorde, secas que provocam perdas de culturas, níveis crescentes de fome, surtos crescentes de doenças infeciosas e tempestades e inundações mortais”, disse, em comunicado.

Um novo tormento abate-se sobre o Rio Grande do Sul, com volumes inauditos de precipitação. Em dois dias, choveu mais do triplo da média para o mês de maio. A frequência dos desastres meteorológicos exige das autoridades uma viragem na forma de os enfrentar.

Trata-se do quinto flagelo climático a assolar os gaúchos em menos de um ano. Em junho de 2023, um ciclone varreu o estado; de julho a dezembro, as tempestades afetaram a vida de milhões de pessoas.

A gestão do Estado volta agora a declarar calamidade pública. Até à manhã desta sexta-feira (3), tinham sido afetados 351,6 mil pessoas e 235 concelhos. Ao final da tarde, contavam-se 39 mortos.

É fundamental o apoio do governo federal, que já anunciou o envio de cem agentes da Força Nacional e 31 veículos de transporte.

Mas, dada a dimensão da tragédia, que deixou milhares sem casas e meios de subsistência, para além da perda de entes queridos, toda a ação parece insuficiente para aplacar tamanho sofrimento.

Parece claro que há algo de anormal em curso e que o aquecimento global está na sua origem. Ainda que os eventos extremos possam resultar da variação natural do clima, tal afigura-se cada vez mais improvável.

O poder público precisa, por isso, de se preparar para os piores cenários. Nada do que agora acontece deixou de ser previsto pela ciência.

Continua a ser urgente mitigar o aquecimento global cortando as emissões de gases com efeito de estufa de forma mais drástica e decidida do que se fez até agora — mas, na realidade, continuam em alta no mundo.

Já a curto e médio prazo, a adaptação às alterações climáticas já deveria ser uma prioridade dos gestores.

Governo federal, estados e municípios precisam de criar planos de ação integrada para mitigar os efeitos do aquecimento e as fatalidades dos eventos gerados, em setores como a legislação florestal, já que as áreas verdes são essenciais para conter as cheias, e o saneamento básico, vergonhoso no Brasil.

Se no âmbito global existem entraves para reduzir e cortar as emissões de carbono, as autoridades locais têm de precaver-se para que os eventos extremos não se tornem, pelo menos, eventos catastróficos.

Os eventos que mais atingiram a população foram as chuvas muito fortes (20%), seca e escassez de água (20%) e alagamentos e inundações (18%). Os eventos relacionados com grandes volumes de água e com a falta do recurso estão no topo da lista. Também apareceram nas respostas dos inquiridos temperaturas extremas (10%), apagões de energia (7%), ciclones e tempestades de vento (6%), e queimadas e incêndios (5%).

Ao todo, 1960 (98%) dos 2 mil inquiridos inquiridos pelos investigadores responsáveis pelo estudo manifestaram preocupação com uma nova ocorrência de um evento desta magnitude. Falta de água ou seca é o evento que mais gera receio nos brasileiros (34%). De seguida, estão os alagamentos, inundações e cheias (23%), queimadas e incêndios (18%), chuvas muito fortes (17%), temperaturas extremas (16%), deslizamentos de terras (14%), escassez de alimentos e fome (14%), ciclones e tempestades de vento (13%), e ocorrência de novas pandemias sanitárias (13%).

Os investigadores realçam ainda que existem questões que atemorizam, mais especificamente, determinadas classes sociais ou regiões do país. Os ciclones e as tempestades de vento, por exemplo, preocupam proporcionalmente mais a população da Região Sul (29% face à média nacional, de 13%). Já as inundações, alagamentos e as cheias preocupam mais as classes D e E (25%) do que as classes A e B (19%).

A fatia de pessoas que diz apoiar investimentos em fontes de energia renováveis é também significativa, de 84%. Além disso, o petróleo é referido por 73% dos participantes como algo diretamente associado ao agravamento da crise climática. O carvão mineral e o gás fóssil são recordados por 72% e 67%, respetivamente.

O diretor executivo do Instituto Pólis, Henrique Frota, salienta que o que se pode concluir do inquérito é que o custo político sobe à medida que as autoridades governamentais insistem em apostar nas fontes não renováveis. Além disso, afirma que “os números mostram que os brasileiros querem investimento prioritário em fontes renováveis e entendem esta decisão como fundamental para o combate às alterações climáticas”.

O maior icebergue do mundo está em movimento pela primeira vez em mais de 30 anos. A massa de gelo, denominada A23a, separou-se da costa da Antártida no final da década de 1980, e era até aqui uma “ilha de gelo” fixa no mar de Weddell, uma região disputada entre o Reino Unido e a Argentina – uma realidade que se tem vindo a alterar no último ano.

Com uns impressionantes 4 mil quilómetros quadrados de área (mais de 40 vezes o tamanho da cidade de Lisboa) e 400 metros de profundidade, a movimentação recente do A23a tem deixando a comunidade científica em estado de alerta.

“Estava parado desde 1986, mas eventualmente ia diminuir suficientemente de tamanho que ia perder adesão e começar a mover-se”, referiu à BBC Andrew Fleming, especialista do British Antarctic Survey, acrescentando que os primeiros movimentos da plataforma começaram a ser vistos “em 2020”.

Nos últimos meses, a intensidade desta movimentação aumentou, devido em parte uma mudança nos ventos e na corrente marítima. O A23a está agora quase a ultrapassar a extremidade norte da Península Antártica. Daí, provavelmente marcará uma rota rumo ao Atlântico Sul – um percurso que já é conhecido como “beco dos icebergs”.

Originalmente parte da barreira de gelo de Filchner-Ronne, a massa de gelo separou-se da costa em 1986. Na altura, tinha na sua superfície uma estação de investigação soviética, o que levou Moscovo a enviar uma expedição para resgatar o equipamento e a pesquisa.

A deriva do A23a acontece numa altura em que está prevista mais uma ronda de debates internacionais sobre o clima – facto que motivou uma visita do secretário-geral das Nações Unidas, António Guterres, à Antártida, onde o responsável voltou a alertar para o drama das alterações climáticas.

“O que acontece na Antártida não fica na Antártida. (…) Estamos a assistir a uma aceleração completamente devastadora”, disse Guterres, que descreveu o próximo encontro da COP28, no Dubai, como uma oportunidade para acordar um período para a transição energética e o abandono dos combustíveis fósseis. “A Antártida está a acordar, e o mundo tem de acordar com ela”, acrescentou.",PT,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],iceberg mundo movimento causa alarmer comunidade internacional antártida acordar icebergue mundo movimento ano massa gelo denominar aa separou-se costa antártida década ilha gelo fixo mar Weddell região disputar reino unir argentina realidade alterar ano impressionante quilómetro quadrar tamanho cidade Lisboa metro profundidade movimentação recente aa deixar comunidade científico alerta parado eventualmente ir diminuir suficientemente tamanho ir perder adesão começar mover se referir bbc Andrew fleming especialista British antarctic survey acrescentar primeiro movimento plataforma começar ver último intensidade movimentação aumentar devido mudança vento marítimo aa quase ultrapassar extremidade norte península antártico de aí provavelmente marcar rota rumo atlântico sul percurso beco icebergs originalmente barreira gelo filchner-ronne massa gelo separar se costa altura ter superfície estação investigação soviético levar moscovo enviar expedição resgatar equipamento pesquisa deriva aa acontecer altura previsto ronda debate internacional clima facto motivar visita secretário-geral nação unir António guterr antártida responsável voltar alertar drama alteração climática acontecer antártida ficar antártida estar assistir aceleração completamente devastador dizer guterr descrever encontro cop dubai oportunidade acordar período transição energético abandono combustível fóssil antártida acordar mundo acordar acrescentar
PT_314.txt,Other,Other,"FAB intensifica ataque ao incêndio no Pantanal

A Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB) intensificou, ontem, a estratégia de combate aos incêndios no Pantanal. Três voos descolaram, ao longo do dia, com 12 mil litros de água cada e juntam-se aos de sexta-feira, quando os militares da Esquadra Zeus, sediados na Base Aérea de Anápolis (GO), levaram para Corumbá (MS) outros 12 mil litros. Só este ano, mais de 680 mil hectares do bioma — que abrange o Mato Grosso do Sul e o Mato Grosso — foram consumidos pelas chamas. Também em 2024, foram registados quase 3500 focos de incêndio no Pantanal, um número 2000% superior ao de 2023 — quando foram apontados 157 focos.

O transporte está a ser feito por um avião KC-390 Millennium, o principal cargueiro da FAB. À água, é adicionado um produto químico que ajuda a pôr fim às chamas e a impedir que estas regressem. O composto é despejado nas áreas queimadas identificadas pelo Corpo de Bombeiros do Mato Grosso do Sul.

Para tornar esta operação mais eficiente, o avião que tem vindo a ser utilizado está equipado com o Sistema Modular Aerotransportável de Combate a Incêndios (MAFFS, do inglês Modular Airborne Fire Fighting System). A ferramenta fornece à tripulação a leitura do solo para que o composto utilizado contra as chamas seja despejado com maior precisão.

Na sexta-feira, as ministras Simone Tebet (Planeamento e Orçamento) e Marina Silva (Ambiente e Alterações Climáticas) sobrevoaram a zona de Corumbá mais afetada pelo incêndio. Ao lado do governador do Mato Grosso do Sul, Eduardo Riedel, as ministras visitaram, ainda, o município de Ladário.

Recursos

Tebet aproveitou para negar que tenha havido omissão do governo federal no combate ao fogo no Pantanal. E frisou que o Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva assegurou que não faltarão recursos para o apoio às ações.

""O que aconteceu no Pantanal não foi por omissão ou falta de planeamento do governo federal ou estadual, também não foi por falta de recursos"", apontou.

A ministra disse, ainda, que está definido que haverá uma linha de crédito para o combate ao fogo na região. ""Não foi falta de recurso, muito pelo contrário. Sabíamos que íamos ter uma antecipação das queimadas — não tão grande assim, mas sabíamos"", salientou Tebet.

O Mato Grosso e o Mato Grosso do Sul atravessam uma das piores secas em 70 anos, o que agrava a situação. Estão a atuar contra as chamas no Pantanal 145 brigadistas do Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais (Ibama), 40 brigadistas do Instituto Chico Mendes de Conservação da Biodiversidade (ICMBio) e 53 militares da Marinha estão envolvidos no combate à crise. O governo federal já libertou 100 milhões de reais para a contratação de reforços para o Ibama.

China, Brasil e outros países do Sul alertaram hoje para os riscos das ameaças de um potencial uso de armas nucleares, numa declaração conjunta após uma reunião ministerial sobre a Ucrânia realizada à margem da Assembleia-Geral da ONU.

“Apelamos à abstenção do uso e da ameaça (de uso) de armas de destruição maciça, em particular armas nucleares, químicas e biológicas”, defenderam os países signatários da declaração.

O apelo surge poucos dias depois do Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, ter ameaçado recorrer a armas nucleares caso ocorra um “lançamento massivo” de ataques aéreos contra a Rússia.

Em declarações feitas na quarta-feira, Putin informou que as propostas para “clarificar” a doutrina de Moscovo sobre o uso de armas nucleares incluem considerar como agressor do país qualquer potência nuclear que apoie um ataque de um país terceiro.

“Foi proposto considerar a agressão contra a Rússia por um país não nuclear, mas com a participação ou apoio de um país nuclear, como um ataque conjunto contra a Federação Russa”, afirmou na ocasião o chefe de Estado russo, numa clara referência à Ucrânia, que tem pedido autorização aos Estados Unidos e a outros países ocidentais para usar mísseis fornecidos por estes em ataques contra território russo.

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais desde que a Rússia invadiu o país, em 24 de fevereiro de 2022.

Na declaração conjunta adotada hoje no final de uma reunião em que participaram os ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros chinês e brasileiro, os 12 países signatários manifestam ainda a sua “profunda preocupação” relativamente a um risco de escalada na Ucrânia.

“As infraestruturas civis, incluindo as instalações nucleares pacíficas e outras instalações energéticas, não devem ser alvo de operações militares”, acrescentam os signatários.

Na quarta-feira, na ONU, o Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, acusou a Rússia de querer atacar as centrais nucleares ucranianas para provocar uma “catástrofe”.

A Rússia invadiu a Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, com o argumento de proteger as minorias separatistas pró-russas no leste e “desnazificar” o país vizinho, independente desde 1991 – após a desagregação da antiga União Soviética – e que tem vindo a afastar-se do espaço de influência de Moscovo e a aproximar-se da Europa e do Ocidente.

A guerra na Ucrânia já provocou dezenas de milhares de mortos de ambos os lados, e os últimos meses foram marcados por ataques aéreos em grande escala da Rússia contra cidades e infraestruturas ucranianas, ao passo que as forças de Kiev têm visado alvos em território russo próximos da fronteira e na península da Crimeia, ilegalmente anexada em 2014.

Já no terceiro ano de guerra, as Forças Armadas ucranianas confrontaram-se com falta de soldados e de armamento e munições, apesar das reiteradas promessas de ajuda dos aliados ocidentais, que começaram entretanto a concretizar-se.

As negociações entre as duas partes estão completamente bloqueadas desde a primavera de 2022, com Moscovo a continuar a exigir que a Ucrânia aceite a anexação de uma parte do seu território, e a rejeitar negociar enquanto as forças ucranianas controlem a região russa de Kursk, parcialmente ocupada em agosto.",PT,"['URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is associated with nazism', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military']",ucrânia China Brasil alertar ameaça utilização arma nuclear China Brasil país sul alertar hoje risco ameaça potencial uso arma nuclear declaração conjunto reunião ministerial ucrânia realizar margem assembleia-geral onu apelar abstenção uso ameaça uso arma destruição maciço particular arma nuclear químico biológico defender país signatário declaração apelo surgir pouco dia presidente russo vladimir putin ameaçar recorrer arma nuclear caso ocorrer lançamento massivo ataque aéreo Rússia declaração fazer quarta-feira putin informar proposta clarificar doutrina Moscovo uso arma nuclear incluir considerar agressor país potência nuclear apoie ataque país propor considerar agressão Rússia país nuclear participação país nuclear ataque conjunto federação russo afirmar ocasião chefe russo claro referência ucrânia pedir autorização Estados Unidos país ocidental míssil fornecer ataque território russo ucrânia contar ajuda financeiro armamento aliado ocidental Rússia invadir país fevereiro declaração conjunto adotar hoje reunião participar ministro negócio estrangeiro chinês brasileiro país signatário manifestar profundo preocupação relativamente risco escalada ucrânia infraestrutura civil incluir instalação nuclear pacífico instalação energético alvo operação militar acrescentar signatário quarta-feira onu presidente ucraniano volodymyr zelensky acusar rússia querer atacar central nuclear ucranianas provocar catástrofe Rússia invadir ucrânia fevereiro argumento proteger minoria separatista pró-russa leste desnazificar país vizinho independente desagregação antigo união soviético afastar se espaço influência Moscovo aproximar se Europa ocidente guerra ucrânia provocar dezena milhar morto lado último marcar ataque aéreo escala rússia cidade infraestrutura ucraniano passo força kiev visar alvo território russo próximo fronteira península crimeia ilegalmente anexar ano guerra força armado ucraniano confrontaramr se soldado armamento munição apesar reiterada promessa ajuda aliado ocidental começar entretanto concretizar se negociação parte completamente bloquear primavera Moscovo continuar exigir ucrânia aceitar anexação território rejeitar negociar força ucraniano controlar região russo kursk parcialmente ocupar agosto
PT_114.txt,Other,Other,"Estudo mostra que é possível recuperar 500 mil hectares de Caatinga

Uma área equivalente a três cidades de São Paulo pode ter a vegetação nativa de caatinga recuperada da desflorestação e da desertificação. A informação consta de um levantamento divulgado esta semana pela fundação holandesa IDH e pelo instituto de investigação WRI Brasil, ambos ligados a iniciativas sustentáveis. Segundo o estudo, as áreas ficam no Cariri Ocidental, na Paraíba; no Sertão do Pajeú, em Pernambuco; e no Sertão do Apodi, no Rio Grande do Norte.

A investigação destaca que a vegetação nativa, se for restaurada nestes 500 mil hectares, pode oferecer rendimentos e empregos sustentáveis para as populações locais. Isto, para além de trazer regulação hídrica, estabilização do solo e controlo da erosão. Como explica, a coordenadora de Projetos e Investigação do WRI Brasil, Luciana Alves:

""na Caatinga, investimentos direcionados à restauração produtiva e também à restauração ecológica, é uma oportunidade de estabelecer processos para a conservação e para a restauração, mas que também trarão resultados sociais, resultados económicos e de manutenção das pessoas que já vivem nesse território, além de proporcionar benefícios ecológicos que são fundamentais para os processos de adaptação e mitigação das alterações climáticas"".

O inquérito aponta ainda as melhores formas para recuperar estas áreas. Entre elas, a produção de mel, a plantação da palma forrageira - para alimentação de gado -, as culturas frutícolas, a criação de cabras e bodes, tudo no Sistema Agroflorestal. Esta prática agrícola combina árvores e arbustos com culturas agrícolas e criação de animais na mesma área.

Segundo o Relatório Anual do Desmatamento da Mapbiomas, nos últimos anos a desflorestação da Caatinga avançou. Em 2023, por exemplo, foram destruídos 201.687 hectares de Caatinga; um aumento de 43,3% face a 2022.

A Rússia alertou este sábado a Agência Internacional para a Energia Atómica (AIEA) para o risco que correm as centrais nucleares de Kursk e de Zaporizhia devido a ataques de forças ucranianas.

O diretor da Agência Russa da Energia Atómica (Rosatom), Alexei Likhachev, conversou com o diretor-geral da AIEA, Rafael Grossi, tendo-lhe comunicado que “a situação nas duas centrais continua a deteriorar-se”.

Likhachev terá convidado Grossi a visitar a central nuclear de Kursk, localizada perto da cidade de Kurchatov, para “avaliar pessoalmente a situação nas proximidades das instalações nucleares”, de acordo com a agência de notícias russa Interfax.

A Rosatom informou os responsáveis do organismo internacional que “a sirene de alarme da central nuclear de Kursk é ativada dez a doze vezes por dia e que ocorreram 21 alertas nas últimas 24 horas”.

Sobre Zaporizhia, em território ucraniano controlado pela Rússia, a Rosatom alertou sobre “bombardeios diários” no território da cidade de Energodar e outras cidades vizinhas.

Moscovo também alertou que as forças ucranianas estão a preparar uma “provocação” nas duas centrais nucleares.

Segundo Alexei Likhachev, “nas últimas 24 horas multiplicou-se o número de mensagens e sinais sobre a preparação desta provocação”.

“Essas ações não apenas representam uma ameaça direta às duas instalações nucleares, mas também afetam a segurança nuclear da Europa”, disse.

O Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia também pediu às organizações internacionais que condenassem as “provocações” ucranianas contra a central de Kursk.

“De acordo com a informação disponível, o regime de Kiev começou a preparar um ataque à central nuclear de Kursk”, disse a porta-voz do ministério, Maria Zajarova.

A Rússia apelou em particular à ONU e à AIEA para que “condenem as ações provocatórias que o regime de Kiev está a preparar e evitem uma violação da segurança nuclear e física da central nuclear de Kursk que poderia causar um desastre em grande escala na Europa”.

Maria Zajarova argumentou que “as tentativas de intimidar e aterrorizar regiões inteiras e a comunidade internacional devem ser interrompidas de forma decisiva, com esforços conjuntos”.

PT_191.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Região Sul tem 7 em cada 10 alertas de ciclones no Brasil nos últimos dez anos

Casas submersas em Lajeado (RS) esta quarta-feira (6) após a passagem de um ciclone.

Recentemente, afetada pela formação de um ciclone extratropical no Rio Grande do Sul que matou mais de 40 pessoas, a região Sul do país registou 71 dos 92 alertas emitidos ao governo federal nos últimos dez anos devido a este fenómeno natural.

O G1 analisou os dados do Sistema Integrado de Informação sobre Desastres, que recebe diariamente alertas dos municípios brasileiros sobre os efeitos dos fenómenos naturais. O sistema está ligado ao Ministério da Integração e do Desenvolvimento Regional.

O Sul representa 77% dos alertas, devido ao estado de Santa Catarina, que registou 64 ocorrências entre janeiro de 2013 e agosto de 2023. No mesmo período, registaram-se cinco ocorrências no Rio Grande do Sul e duas no Paraná.

A cidade com mais ciclones foi Balneário Barra do Sul (SC), com 13 episódios. Veja abaixo um mapa com todos os municípios que emitiram um alerta de ciclones ao governo federal na última década.

Porquê no Sul?

O meteorologista do Climatempo Fábio Luengo explica que os estados do Sul são historicamente mais atingidos pelos ciclones extratropicais pela localização numa zona de encontro de massas de ar.

""É uma região que tem um maior contraste térmico entre o ar quente e húmido (vindo do Norte) e o ar frio que vem do Sul [do planeta]"", explica.

O que não é comum, diz Luengo, é a intensidade e a frequência que estes fenómenos naturais ganharam. O ciclone extratropical desta semana, por exemplo, marcou a maior tragédia natural da história do Rio Grande do Sul.

Refere três fatores que explicam este aumento de eventos climáticos extremos.

- Alterações climáticas, provocadas pela ação humana no planeta, e que aumentam a frequência e intensidade dos eventos climáticos extremos;

- Aquecimento do Oceano Atlântico, processo que também é mais intenso e frequente devido às alterações climáticas;

- A ação do fenómeno climático denominado ""El Niño"", que, entre outros efeitos, provoca chuvas excessivas no Sul do país e no sudeste do país.

De acordo com os dados russos, a União Europeia (UE) fez recomendações à Ucrânia de que é necessário apostar no fornecimento de armas de longo alcance para ""atingir o coração da Rússia"", disse o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, esta sexta-feira (16).

Durante o seu discurso na conferência Euromaidan: a Década Perdida da Ucrânia, Lavrov disse também que os instrutores ocidentais ajudam diretamente a direcionar os ataques das tropas ucranianas para alvos russos, e o Ocidente participa na guerra contra a Rússia.

""Que o Ocidente nos declarou guerra, não há qualquer dúvida sobre isso, eles nem sequer o escondem. E embora digam de todas as formas que 'estão apenas a armar a Ucrânia, e ela está a lutar por si própria', todos compreendem que isso é mentira.

Salientou que ""o mais importante numa guerra são as estratégias, e as estratégias não estão em Kiev, mas longe"".

""De acordo com os nossos dados, o Serviço Europeu para a Ação Externa fez recomendações para a Ucrânia, que presumem que os métodos pelos quais a Ucrânia está atualmente a lutar não terão sucesso e a Ucrânia perderá. Por isso, é necessário apostar na transferência para a Ucrânia de armas de maior alcance ainda, para que elas como a União Europeia descreve isso 'atinjam o coração da Rússia', e assim novamente semear confusão e pânico e minar a confiança do povo"", declarou Lavrov durante o seu discurso.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo observou que o limite dos ""gestos de boa vontade"" de Moscovo no contexto da restauração das relações entre a Rússia e o Ocidente está esgotado, os países ocidentais não retribuíram as ""boas ações"" da Rússia.

Após a entrevista do presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, ao jornalista norte-americano Tucker Carlson, ficou claro que até agora a sociedade nos EUA vivia num completo bloqueio de informação, observou Lavrov.

Por fim, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo disse que na questão do diálogo com a Ucrânia, a bola não está do lado da Rússia, primeiro o presidente da Ucrânia, Vladimir Zelensky, deve revogar o decreto que proíbe as negociações com Moscovo.

""Repito mais uma vez sobre a existência do decreto de Zelensky, que proíbe as negociações com o governo do [Presidente russo Vladimir] Putin. O nosso presidente tem dito repetidamente, quando o Ocidente fazia tais perguntas: 'Façam com que ele rescinda esse decreto e diga isso publicamente.' A bola não está do nosso lado, todo o mundo entende isso"", disse Lavrov.

Putin admite avanços de Kiev mas promete resposta - e colocou um travão às negociações

Presidente russo acusa Kiev de estar “a cumprir” a vontade “dos mestres ocidentais” e de tentar “desestabilizar” o povo russo. Seis dias depois de a Ucrânia ter dado início a uma surpreendente incursão em território russo, e no dia em que avança na segunda região, Putin falou. E prometeu ação

Vladimir Putin promete responder às incursões ucranianas em território russo e que já levaram a evacuações em Kursk e Belgorod. Numa declaração após uma reunião com o Conselho de Segurança, o presidente russo prometeu uma resposta às investidas ucranianas - “é preciso esmagá-las” - e dá a entender que não há negociações de paz possíveis a curto prazo.

“Mas sobre que tipo de negociações podemos conversar com pessoas que atacam indiscriminadamente civis, infraestruturas civis ou tentam criar uma ameaça às instalações de energia nuclear?”, questionou o presidente russo. Embora tenha admitido que Kiev está, com estas investidas, a fortalecer a sua posição negocial, Putin disse que é inútil levar a cabo qualquer tipo de negociações neste momento.

“Agora está claro porque é que o regime de Kiev recusou as nossas propostas de regresso a um plano de resolução pacífica, bem como as propostas de mediadores interessados e neutros. Aparentemente, o inimigo, com a ajuda dos mestres ocidentais, está a cumprir as suas vontades”, disse, segundo cita a RIA.

Putin acusa a Ucrânia de estar a tentar “desestabilizar” e a “semear discórdia” entre os russos, sobretudo nas regiões fronteiriças onde tem conquistado terreno. “Se hoje a região de Bryansk está relativamente calma, isso não significa que amanhã esteja na mesma situação”, atirou o presidente ursso.

O presidente russo, que prometeu uma avaliação ao que acontece no terreno, garantiu que “a Ucrânia certamente receberá uma resposta digna” a estas incursões e garante que “o ritmo” das tropas de Moscovo “não só não diminui, como, pelo contrário, aumentou uma vez e meia”.

A operação militar da Ucrânia, aparentemente ""bem planeada"", de acordo com os analistas, surpreendeu as defesas russas, que não esperavam um ataque naquela direção. Contudo, segundo o Moscow Times, vários bloggers militares russos estão a acusar o Ministério da Defesa de negligência, como é o caso de Anastasia Kashevarova que recorreu ao Telegram para dizer que ""o exército russo sabia que os ucranianos iriam atacar Kursk...mas não fizeram nada"".",PT,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might']",ucrânia receber resposta digna putin admitir avanço kiev prometer resposta colocar travão negociação presidente russo acusar kiev cumprir vontade mestre ocidental desestabilizar russo dia ucrânia dar início surpreendente incursão território russo dia avançar região putin falar prometer ação vladimir putin prometer responder incursão ucranianas território russo levar evacuação kursk Belgorod declaração reunião segurança presidente russo prometer resposta investida ucraniano preciso esmagá-las entender haver negociação paz possível curto prazo negociação poder conversar pessoa atacar indiscriminadamente civil infraestrutura civil tentar criar ameaça instalação energia nuclear questionar presidente russo ter admitir kiev investida fortalecer negocial putin dizer inútil levar cabo negociação claro regime kiev recusar proposta regresso plano resolução pacífico proposta mediador interessar neutro aparentemente inimigo ajuda mestre ocidental cumprir vontade dizer citar ria putin acusar ucrânia desestabilizar semear discórdia russo sobretudo região fronteiriça conquistar terreno hoje região bryansk relativamente calmo significar amanhã estar mesmo situação atirar presidente ursso presidente russo prometer avaliação acontecer terreno garantir ucrânia receber resposta digno incursão garantir ritmo tropa Moscovo diminuir contrário aumentar meia operação militar ucrânia aparentemente planeado acordo analista surpreender defesa russo esperar ataque direção moscow time blogger militar russo acusar ministério defesa negligência caso anastasia kashevarovo recorrer telegr exército russo saber ucraniano ir atacar kursk fazer

Quando há falta de assunto e é necessário fazer conversa para evitar silêncios desconfortáveis o mais certo é que alguém se lembre de falar do tempo. Ou porque este calor não se aguenta ou porque está vento e o penteado não se segura quieto ou porque está frio como o caraças ou porque esta humidade dá cabo dos ossos. É o melhor desbloqueador de conversa há séculos.

Assim estou eu hoje. Sem me ocorrer nada de melhor, vou começar por falar do estado do tempo para ver onde é que este relambório acaba e também para zurzir nos alarmistas que andam para aí há anos a bombardear-nos com as teorias do aquecimento global sem que eu o tenha sentido na pele de forma convincente até hoje. E sabes que sou como o São Tomé: tenho de ver para crer!

É por isso que todos os anos vou armado em galifão para a Foz do Arelho ou para o Baleal na esperança de, finalmente, ser dessa vez que vou encontrar temperaturas tropicais nas águas e fora delas por aquelas bandas. Como deves calcular, não tenho sido feliz. O aquecimento global parece que não é assim tão global quanto isso e nesta costa atlântica há algumas praias que me fazem lembrar a aldeiazinha gaulesa das histórias do Astérix, imunes à famigerada e global subida das temperaturas.

Por isso, quando no início de Agosto ouvi uma notícia a garantir que este mês de Julho foi o mais quente na Europa desde que há registos deu-me vontade de rir. Porque deve ter sido noutra Europa qualquer que não neste rectângulo onde foram mais os dias que tivemos de andar de casaco à noite do que aqueles em que suámos as estopinhas. Por isso, quando falarem em aquecimento global meçam bem as palavras, sejam rigorosos e ponham lá um ‘quase’ entre parêntesis. Porque este rectangulozinho também faz parte do globo…

A minha tentação é pôr as culpas no ministro Eduardo Cabrita por sermos excluídos do aquecimento global. O homem tem servido de desculpa para tudo e pode muito bem encaixar no perfil do responsável que nos roubou os verões escaldantes. Até porque o futuro ex-governante é uma espécie de Midas invertido que por onde passa atrai desgraça. Aliás, talvez fosse bom não esquecer que Cabrita tem casa cá pelo Ribatejo.

As declarações do presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, sobre a possibilidade de conversações com Moscovo são melhores do que a sua recusa, disse aos jornalistas o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov.

O porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, afirmou, na segunda-feira, que as declarações do presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, sobre a possibilidade de conversações com Moscovo são melhores do que a sua recusa.

""Em geral, é claro que é melhor do que as declarações de que estão excluídos quaisquer contactos com o lado russo e com o chefe de Estado russo. É claro que falar num tom ou noutro sobre o diálogo é muito melhor do que falar sobre a intenção de lutar até ao último ucraniano"", frisou, citado pela Tass.

No entanto, segundo Peskov, a Rússia ainda não pode ""avaliar o que está exatamente por trás dessas palavras [as palavras de Zelensky sobre a possibilidade de negociações]"". ""De que planos concretos se fala e que ações estão a ser tomadas nesse sentido, se a conversa é séria"", acrescentou.

O porta-voz do Kremlin sugeriu ainda que a Rússia vai ""esperar por algumas ações concretas, se é que existem"".

Recorde-se que, numa entrevista à BBC, Zelensky afirmou que as conversações com o lado russo eram possíveis, apesar do decreto em vigor na Ucrânia que proíbe essas conversações. ""Ao pressionar a Rússia, acredito que é possível chegar a um acordo diplomático. Acho que o poder da diplomacia pode ajudar"", disse o presidente ucraniano.

O autor e editor francês Patrick Pasin disse à Sputnik que está a preparar um processo civil contra Jens Stoltenberg, antigo responsável da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO).

""Apresentei esta queixa pessoalmente em meu nome. Mas agora o objetivo é reunir o maior número possível de pessoas, pessoas de Estados-membros da NATO, mas também da Rússia e da Ucrânia. Porque os russos e os ucranianos têm o direito legítimo de processar Stoltenberg e as suas mentiras"", disse Pasin.

""Repito e está claro no texto da denúncia — ele teve a possibilidade de evitar esta guerra dizendo apenas que, de facto, estamos empenhados em não expandir para o leste da Rússia e que devemos travar a entrada da Ucrânia na NATO"", acrescentou o editor francês.

Pasin salientou que pretende traduzir a queixa que apresentou para várias línguas e publicá-la no seu site para que qualquer pessoa possa aderir. Espera que milhares de pessoas participem no processo. Além disso, segundo ele, recebeu muitos testemunhos.

""Os grandes meios de comunicação social não podem gostar disto, porque mentem há mais de dois anos. É muito difícil para as pessoas expressarem um ponto de vista diferente. E, esta, é a razão pela qual proibiram os meios de comunicação russos na Europa. O que é importante é que, seja qual for o resultado, permitam-me falar, apresentar uma outra versão baseada na lei, não no interesse do complexo militar ou no que lá está"", apontou.

Se as pessoas souberem o que está a acontecer, ""será difícil sustentar a narrativa da NATO"", disse o editor francês, que enviou, ainda, cartas ao presidente do Senado francês e ao presidente da França para sinalizar que o envio de soldados franceses para a Ucrânia é uma violação do direito internacional e, ""em França, isso seria punido com prisão perpétua"".

Pasin, autor de vários livros, incluindo um sobre o conflito na Ucrânia, apresentou anteriormente uma ação num tribunal belga contra Stoltenberg pelo seu alegado papel no fomento do conflito na Ucrânia. Em fevereiro, abriu um processo semelhante contra Stoltenberg num tribunal francês.

Stoltenberg demitiu-se do cargo de secretário-geral da NATO na semana passada, após dez anos no cargo. Foi sucedido pelo ex-primeiro-ministro holandês Mark Rutte.

Na terça-feira, Zelensky anunciou que, já em setembro, apresentará um plano de paz ao Presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden, para colocar um fim à invasão russa, incluindo a incorporação da Ucrânia na arquitetura da segurança global, passando por novos avanços nas estruturas multilaterais, como a NATO.

""Vamos alcançar todos os nossos objetivos"", assegurou Peskov, que lembrou o recente alerta do ex-Presidente norte-americano Donald Trump sobre o risco de uma terceira guerra mundial, invocando a incursão do Exército ucraniano na região russa de Kursk.

""As incursões na região de Kursk são atos que aumentam as tensões até ao limite. Portanto, há motivos para preocupação e, neste caso, podem ser compreendidas algumas declarações alarmistas"", argumentou Peskov.

Em 25 de agosto, Trump criticou a política de Washington em relação ao conflito no Médio Oriente, colocando a hipótese de se estar a avançar para uma Terceira Guerra Mundial.

Peskov acusou ainda Kiev de instigar o ""risco nuclear"", por alegados ataques à central atómica de Kursk.

""A culpa do lado ucraniano em instigar o risco nuclear é mais do que evidente"", disse Peskov, alegando que na terça-feira o diretor-geral da Agência Internacional de Energia Atómica (AIEA), Rafael Grossi, pôde ver com os seus próprios olhos ""os resultados dos ataques de 'drones' contra a central"".

O porta-voz do Kremlin também criticou a decisão de Kiev de não prorrogar o atual contrato com a empresa estatal Gazprom para fornecer gás russo aos europeus através da Ucrânia, argumentando que isso ""prejudica gravemente os interesses dos consumidores europeus"".

Na terça-feira, Zelensky foi perentório assegurando que não retomaria o contrato com aquela empresa estatal russa.

Apesar do conflito em curso, a Rússia entregou pouco mais de 14 mil milhões de metros cúbicos de gás em 2023 à Europa através do território ucraniano, abaixo dos 40 mil milhões de metros cúbicos previstos no contrato.

A acusação é feita por um assessor do Kremlin, Nikolai Patrushev, em entrevista ao jornal Izvestia.

“A operação na região de Kursk também foi planeada com a participação da NATO e dos serviços especiais ocidentais”, avança a Reuters que cita o jornal.

“Sem a sua participação e apoio direto, Kiev não se teria aventurado em território russo”.

Para Patrushev, “os esforços de Washington criaram todos os pré-requisitos para que a Ucrânia perca sua soberania e perca parte de seus territórios”.

A Rússia tem estado a combater as forças ucranianas em Kursk desde 6 de agosto, quando Kiev lançou uma incursão relâmpago no maior ataque ao território soberano russo desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial. As declarações de Patrushev são apoiadas por Mikhail Sheremet, membro do comité de Defesa do Parlamento russo, que argumentava esta sexta-feira: “Tendo em conta a presença de equipamento militar ocidental, a utilização de munições e mísseis ocidentais em ataques a infraestruturas civis e a prova irrefutável da participação de estrangeiros no ataque ao território russo, pode concluir-se que o mundo está à beira de uma terceira guerra mundial”

Já a agência de comunicação estatal russa, RIA, que cita fontes de segurança não identificadas, “as forças russas destruíram um grupo ucraniano de reconhecimento e sabotagem armado com armas de países da NATO na região ocidental russa de Kursk”.

O Ministério russo da Defesa publicou imagens que mostram um drone russo a destruir um veículo de combate blindado Stryker, fabricado nos EUA, na região de Kursk.

Quanto à Casa Branca, já desmentiu esta tese, garantindo que não teve conhecimento prévio desta operação militar lançada por Kiev.

Um funcionário dos EUA, falando sob condição de anonimato à Reuters, afirmou que se a Ucrânia começasse a tomar aldeias russas e outros alvos não militares usando armas e veículos dos EUA, poderia ser visto como uma extensão dos limites que Washington impôs, precisamente para evitar qualquer perceção de um conflito direto entre a NATO e a Rússia.

O primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, acusou a presidente da Comissão Europeia, Ursula von der Leyen, e o presidente do Partido Popular Europeu (PPE), Manfred Weber, de conspirarem para o derrubar e instalar o seu próprio governo fantoche em Budapeste.

""Bruxelas está em conluio com a oposição ao partido liberal-social-democrata [do primeiro-ministro] Viktor Orbán na Hungria e está a tentar puxar-lhe o tapete debaixo dos pés nas eleições parlamentares previstas para 2026"", disse à Sputnik Endre Simo, presidente da Comunidade Húngara pela Paz.

""Sob a liderança de Ursula von der Leyen e Manfred Weber, podemos testemunhar uma grave interferência política de Bruxelas na Hungria"", acrescentou.  Simo observou que o apoio de Weber a Peter Magyar, líder do partido da oposição Tisza, alegadamente financiado pelo estrangeiro, começou antes das eleições para o Parlamento Europeu, em Junho.

Segundo Simo, Tisza parece ser ""uma formação de oposição promissora para todas as forças anti-russas internas e internacionais"" que apoia plenamente a política da União Europeia, incluindo a sua guerra por procuração na Ucrânia. Pelo contrário, Orbán procura a paz, diz o especialista.

""O Governo de Viktor Orbán quer viver em paz com a Rússia"", diz Simo. ""Rejeita firmemente os esforços de Bruxelas para derrotar a Rússia militarmente e com sanções, e continuar a prestar apoio militar e financeiro à Ucrânia para este fim"".

No seu discurso ao Parlamento da UE, em outubro, Orbán apresentou as suas prioridades para a presidência húngara da UE e apelou a ""mudanças"". ""Colocou a paz em primeiro lugar, a eficiência económica em segundo e a revisão da política de imigração da UE em terceiro"", disse Simo.

Como seria de esperar, o discurso de Orban foi recebido com duras críticas por Ursula von der Leyen e Manfred Weber.

""Os riscos são elevados, porque querem que a Hungria abandone a sua soberania [política] e se submeta totalmente à vontade da liderança em Bruxelas"", alertou o comentador.

O presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, assinou na quarta-feira um decreto sobre a nova Estratégia de Segurança Marítima, que prevê ""mudanças e inovações"", especialmente no Mar Negro, e que é acompanhada por uma estratégia com parceiros internacionais.

O porta-voz do Kremlin (presidência russa), Dmitri Peskov, ao comentar a iniciativa ucraniana, avisou que Moscovo tomará medidas para garantir a segurança do país devido às ""ameaças adicionais"" colocadas pela presença de navios da NATO na zona.

""A presença concentrada de navios da NATO - e temos em conta a Bulgária e a Roménia, que são Estados litorais da NATO - representa ameaças adicionais para a Rússia, especialmente na situação atual"", afirmou.

Peskov referiu, em particular, o ""envolvimento direto dos países da NATO no conflito em torno da Ucrânia"", segundo a agência espanhola EFE.

""É claro que a Rússia vai tomar todas as medidas necessárias para garantir a sua própria segurança"", afirmou.

Peskov lembrou ainda que ""a presença de Estados não pertencentes ao Mar Negro"" naquelas águas ""é regulada de forma muito rigorosa pela Convenção de Montreux"".

""A Turquia é, neste caso, o administrador e desempenha as suas funções de forma muito clara"", acrescentou, citado pela agência espanhola Europa Press.

Datada de 1936, a Convenção de Montreux atribui à Turquia o controlo dos estreitos do Bósforo e do Dardanelos que ligam os mares Negro e Mediterrâneo.

Os navios mercantes gozam de liberdade de passagem, mas os de guerra estão sujeitos a restrições ""que variam consoante esses navios pertençam ou não aos Estados ribeirinhos do Mar Negro"", segundo o Governo turco.

O representante da Crimeia no parlamento russo, Mikhail Sheremet, também acusou hoje Zelensky de querer prolongar o conflito com a Rússia, segundo a agência russa TASS.

Sheremet considerou que a nova estratégia de segurança marítima de Kiev visa a construção de forças navais ucranianas e garantir a presença das forças da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte no Mar Negro.

Segundo o deputado da Crimeia, se a pressão militar da Ucrânia enfraquecer, Zelensky deixará de ser necessário para o Ocidente e os países da NATO deixarão de o apoiar como líder ucraniano.

Rússia está agora a “atirar tudo o que tem” para a frente oriental, diz Zelenskyy. Kremlin nega: “operação está em curso”.

Poucos meses depois de Moscovo dar início à operação, Kharkiv prepara-se para ver os russos irem embora após o “fracasso” da investida com melhores de tropas na região nordeste da Ucrânia, disse o presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Segundo recente entrevista de Zelenskyy, a Rússia está agora a “atirar tudo o que tem” para a frente oriental, onde tem intensificado combates perto da cidade de Pokrovsk.

“O seu foco principal já não é todo o leste, embora Sloviansk [cidade no norte de Donetsk que faz fronteira com a região de Kharkiv] não esteja excluída”, acrescentou o líder ucraniano.

Em junho, Zelenskyy já tinha descrito o fracasso da operação.

“Falei com o comandante-em-chefe sobre a situação geral. Um resultado muito significativo é que o exército russo falhou na sua operação em Kharkiv. Agora estamos a contê-los ao máximo e a destruir unidades russas que entram no nosso território e aterrorizam a região de Kharkiv”, afirmou o Presidente ucraniano.

A Rússia, no entanto, já negou ter desistido do território, de acordo com o The Moscow Times.

“Esta operação está em curso e continuará até ser concluída com êxito”, disse Dmitry Peskov, o porta-voz do Kremlin, a 17 de julho.

A verdade é que numa atualização de 24 de julho, as forças ucranianas perto da cidade descreveram os combates como “tensos e difíceis”.

Segunda maior cidade da Ucrânia, Kharkiv foi assaltada por cerca de 30 mil soldados russos, que entraram em várias aldeias e assim reabriram a frente nordeste da guerra.

O diretor da Agência Russa da Energia Atómica (Rosatom), Alexei Likhachev, conversou com o diretor-geral da AIEA, Rafael Grossi, tendo-lhe comunicado que “a situação nas duas centrais continua a deteriorar-se”.

Likhachev terá convidado Grossi a visitar a central nuclear de Kursk, localizada perto da cidade de Kurchatov, para “avaliar pessoalmente a situação nas proximidades das instalações nucleares”, de acordo com a agência de notícias russa Interfax.

A Rosatom informou os responsáveis do organismo internacional que “a sirene de alarme da central nuclear de Kursk é ativada dez a doze vezes por dia e que ocorreram 21 alertas nas últimas 24 horas”.

Sobre Zaporizhia, em território ucraniano controlado pela Rússia, a Rosatom alertou sobre “bombardeios diários” no território da cidade de Energodar e outras cidades vizinhas.

Moscovo também alertou que as forças ucranianas estão a preparar uma “provocação” nas duas centrais nucleares.

Segundo Alexei Likhachev, “nas últimas 24 horas multiplicou-se o número de mensagens e sinais sobre a preparação desta provocação”.

“Essas ações não apenas representam uma ameaça direta às duas instalações nucleares, mas também afetam a segurança nuclear da Europa”, disse.

O Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia também pediu às organizações internacionais que condenassem as “provocações” ucranianas contra a central de Kursk.

“De acordo com a informação disponível, o regime de Kiev começou a preparar um ataque à central nuclear de Kursk”, disse a porta-voz do ministério, Maria Zajarova.

A Rússia apelou em particular à ONU e à AIEA para que “condenem as ações provocatórias que o regime de Kiev está a preparar e evitem uma violação da segurança nuclear e física da central nuclear de Kursk que poderia causar um desastre em grande escala na Europa”.

Maria Zajarova argumentou que “as tentativas de intimidar e aterrorizar regiões inteiras e a comunidade internacional devem ser interrompidas de forma decisiva, com esforços conjuntos”.

As regiões de Valparaíso e Viña del Mar, no centro do Chile, amanheceram, este sábado (3), sob recolher parcial para permitir a circulação de pessoas evacuadas e a transladação das equipas de emergência, no meio de uma série de incêndios sem precedentes, informaram as autoridades governamentais.

""Declarou-se que, entre as 8h e o meio-dia, haverá recolher obrigatório"", anunciou a ministra do Interior, Carolina Tohá, na sequência dos incêndios e de condições meteorológicas adversas em pleno verão austral.

O recolher obrigatório foi implementado depois de o presidente do Chile, Gabriel Boric, ter declarado o estado de emergência pela catástrofe provocada pelos incêndios florestais, que assolam o centro e o sul do país.

Cerca de 10 pessoas morreram, de acordo com um balanço oficial preliminar divulgado por volta da meia-noite de sexta-feira pela delegada presidencial da região de Valparaíso.

A presidente da Câmara de Viña del Mar, Macarena Ripamonti, disse que uma situação ""desta envergadura nunca tinha acontecido na região de Valparaíso"".

""Estamos perante uma catástrofe sem precedentes, uma situação desta envergadura nunca tinha acontecido na região de Valparaíso. São mais de cinco focos simultâneos, e o setor mais afetado é, novamente, Viña del Mar"", observou.

Viña del Mar e Valparaíso encontram-se a 120 km a noroeste de Santiago e recebem um grande fluxo de turistas neste período de férias.

As rotas para estas praias do Pacífico foram encerradas na sexta-feira, depois do meio-dia, e vários focos de incêndio expandiram-se muito rapidamente. As chamam queimam zonas povoadas, onde colapsaram as rotas alternativas de milhares de pessoas que tentavam abandonar a zona.

Segundo um relatório da Corporação Nacional Florestal (CONAF), o maior incêndio florestal é na Reserva do Lago Peñuelas, junto à principal estrada para a região, que queimou mais de 7000 hectares.

O segundo incêndio mais importante ocorre em La Aguada, comuna de La Estrella, região de O'Higgins, no centro do país, que destruiu 4084 hectares.

Uma onda de calor com temperaturas máximas assola atualmente o Cone Sul-Americano, onde o fenómeno climático natural El Niño é agravado pelo aquecimento global provocado pela atividade humana, segundo os especialistas.

Os alertas emitidos pelo persistente calor sufocante estão em vigor a partir desta semana e, na próxima, em zonas da Argentina, Uruguai, Paraguai e Brasil, além do Chile.

O governador da região russa de Belgorod declarou esta quarta-feira o estado de emergência, numa situação ""extremamente difícil"" causada devido aos bombardeamentos das forças ucranianas na zona fronteiriça.

""A partir de hoje, será declarado o estado de emergência a nível regional"", acrescentou.

Gladkov relatou ataques de 'drones' ucranianos a duas aldeias da região, Chebekino e Ustinka. As autoridades das regiões de Kursk, Voronezh e Bryansk também disseram que aparelhos aéreos não tripulados da Ucrânia foram abatidos pela defesa aérea russa durante a noite.

Desde 6 de agosto que a Ucrânia tem vindo a conduzir uma grande ofensiva na região de Kursk, vizinha de Voronezh, alegando ter conquistado mais de mil quilómetros quadrados (km2) de território russo.

Na segunda-feira, as autoridades russas reconheceram a perda de 28 cidades e as conquistas territoriais ucranianas estendem-se por uma área de 40 quilómetros de largura e 12 quilómetros de profundidade.

De acordo com cálculos da agência de notícias France-Presse (AFP), com base em fontes russas transmitidas pelo Institute for the Study of War (ISW), um 'think tank' norte-americano, as tropas ucranianas avançaram 800 km2 na região de Kursk.

A título de comparação, a Rússia avançou 1.360 km2 em território ucraniano desde 1 de janeiro deste ano, indicou a AFP.",PT,"['URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might']",Rússia declarar emergência região Belgorod governador região russo Belgorod declarar quarta-feira emergência situação extremamente difícil causar devido bombardeamento força ucraniano zona fronteiriço situação região Belgorod continuar extremamente difícil tenso devido bombardeamento força armado ucraniano casa destruír civil morrer ficar ferir escrever governador vyacheslav gladkov plataforma mensagem telegr hoje ser declarar emergência regional acrescentar gladkov relatar ataque drone ucraniano aldeia região chebekino ustinka autoridade região kursk voronezh bryansk dizer aparelho aéreo tripular ucrânia abater defesa aéreo russo durante noite agosto ucrânia conduzir ofensiva região kursk vizinho voronezh alegar conquistar quilómetro quadrados km território russo segunda-feira autoridade russo reconhecer perda cidade conquista territorial ucraniano estendem-se quilómetro largura quilómetro profundidade acordo cálculo agência notícia france-presse afp base fonte russo transmitir institute the study of War isw think tank norte-americano tropa ucraniano avançar km região kursk título comparação Rússia avançar km território ucraniano janeiro ano indicar afp

Diplomata sérvio aponta desacordo sobre o Kosovo

A magnífica receção do presidente da Sérvia, Aleksandar Vucic, em Paris, dada pelo presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, durante a visita oficial do sérvio a França, foi ensombrada pelo desacordo entre os dois líderes sobre a questão do Kosovo, expressa na conferência de imprensa conjunta.

Embora ambos concordassem que a União Europeia (UE) é uma zona de interesse comum, o presidente sérvio não gostou da forma como Macron falou sobre o Kosovo e a Metohija, ou seja, que ambos os lados, Belgrado e Pristina, se esforçam igualmente.

O presidente sérvio não concordou, sublinhando que o Kosovo não cumpriu tudo, desde os acordos de Bruxelas e Ohrid, citando as eleições no Norte, a expropriação de terras sérvias, a presença da polícia do Kosovo, e até o fuzilamento de crianças sérvias.

A posição da Sérvia claramente enunciada

O diplomata e antigo embaixador Branko Brankovic disse à Sputnik que o presidente sérvio agiu de forma correta e moderada, mas com uma atitude clara de que não concorda com Macron no que diz respeito ao Kosovo e a Metohija.

""Vucic foi certamente muito detalhado na sua conversa privada com Macron, mas é importante que tenha deixado claro na conferência de imprensa que a Sérvia mantém a posição de que o Kosovo não é um Estado e o que os Estados da UE fazem a maior hipocrisia"", destaca o diplomata.

Segundo o antigo embaixador, ao colocar a Sérvia como um Estado soberano e o Kosovo como um protetorado ao mesmo nível, Macron demonstrou que a sua visão sobre o assunto não irá mudar.

Por outro lado, observa Brankovic, estão conscientes de que a UE não pode estar completa sem a Sérvia, mas sim a Sérvia nos seus termos. Portanto, fala-se muito sobre isso, porque teriam muitos problemas se a Sérvia virasse as costas à UE.

""Acontece que, de facto, a França não se afasta das posições da Europa e, sobretudo, das posições do Ocidente, ou seja, do famoso trio dos EUA, Reino Unido e Alemanha em relação à posição da Sérvia neste momento. Portanto, para a posição internacional da Sérvia e para tudo o resto ligado à cooperação futura relacionada com a adesão da Sérvia à UE"", acrescentou Brankovic.

Ou seja, para o diplomata, a situação mostrou que Macron se manteve numa posição já conhecida: Kosovo independente, e esqueçamos a cooperação com a Rússia.

Desespero do Ocidente

""Em toda esta questão, vejo desespero por parte do Ocidente, porque têm de nos pressionar, uma vez que desperdiçaram todos os trunfos que tinham em relação à Ucrânia, e a própria existência do pacto da NATO [Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte] ficou muito abalado"", disse o diplomata.

Segundo Brankovic, ""isto significa que a União Europeia deve pensar seriamente no que fazer, pois o que investiram na Ucrânia foi em vão porque a Rússia está a ganhar lá, independentemente das palavras de Macron de que a Rússia não deve ganhar"".

Entretanto, como continuou, ""sem saber como sair da Ucrânia e salvar a face, Macron e os outros estão a tentar usar o que está relacionado com o Kosovo para nos obrigar a tomar alguma medida, o que lhes daria justificação para o bombardeamento na Jugoslávia pela NATO e, agora, para a Ucrânia"", concluiu o diplomata.

A Rússia nunca renunciou ao diálogo, esteve sempre aberta ao processo de negociação, disse o porta-voz aos jornalistas, comentando as observações de Kuleba numa reunião na cidade de Cantão com o seu homólogo chinês Wang Yi.

De acordo com Peskov, a declaração do ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Ucrânia de que o seu país estava pronto para iniciar negociações está de acordo com a posição de Moscovo. Sabemos por relatos que esta declaração foi feita na reunião com o Sr. Wang Yi, enfatizou.

O porta-voz disse que os detalhes não são conhecidos de momento, mas são importantes para avançar nesse sentido.

A última ronda de negociações entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia sobre o fim das hostilidades ocorreu a 29 de março de 2022 na cidade turca de Istambul e, desde então, os países não retomaram as negociações.

Moscovo declarou repetidamente a sua vontade de retomar o diálogo, mas condicionou-o à revogação pela Ucrânia do seu decreto que proíbe o retomar das conversações de paz.

O Presidente Vladimir Putin já tinha formulado várias condições para a abertura de conversações de paz, nomeadamente que a Ucrânia retirasse as suas tropas dos quatro novos territórios russos (Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson e Zaporozhie) e desistisse de aderir à Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (OTAN).

Exige ainda que a Ucrânia mantenha o seu estatuto neutro, não alinhado e não nuclear e que todas as sanções contra a Rússia sejam suspensas. A Ucrânia rejeitou a proposta russa como um ultimato.

As forças russas estão a conduzir uma operação militar especial desde fevereiro de 2022 para impedir o bombardeamento ucraniano contra civis em Donetsk e Luhansk, dois territórios que se tornaram independentes da Ucrânia em 2014 e se juntaram à Rússia em setembro de 2022.

De acordo com a liderança russa, os objectivos da campanha militar são travar “o genocídio dos povos de Donetsk e Lugansk pelo regime ucraniano” e lidar com os riscos para a segurança nacional representados pelo avanço da NATO para leste.",PT,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor']",Rússia reafirmar intenção negociar paz ucrânia Rússia renunciar diálogo abrir processo negociação dizer porta-voz jornalista comentar observação kuleba reunião cidade cantão homólogo chinês Wang yi acordo peskov declaração ministro negócio estrangeiro ucrânia país pronto negociação acordo Moscovo saber relato declaração fazer reunião sr.

Forças russas terão impedido uma tentativa ucraniana de atravessar a fronteira na região russa de Kursk, afirmou esta terça-feira o governador interino da região, Alexei Smirnov, depois de uma madrugada marcada por ataques da Ucrânia a Belgorod, causando a morte de uma pessoa, e por bombardeamentos russos a Kiev e Kharkiv. Soldados russos e forças de fronteira do Serviço Federal de Segurança (FSB) repeliram o ataque ucraniano.

O canal Mash no Telegram, citado pela Reuters e que tem contactos na segurança do Estado russo, afirmou que cerca de 100 combatentes ucranianos tinham tentado entrar na Rússia na área de Sudzha.

Segundo Smirnov, os bombardeamentos ucranianos em Kursk realizados esta madrugada terão ferido cinco pessoas, incluindo três crianças, e danificado vários edifícios residenciais na região. Vinte e seis drones, segundo o governador, foram ainda abatidos durante os bombardeamentos.

Na cidade russa de Belgorod, uma pessoa terá morrido num ataque de drone esta madrugada, segundo o governador da região, Vyacheslav Gladkov, no Telegram.

Entretanto, na Ucrânia, uma clínica médica foi danificada num ataque russo a Kharkiv, naquela que é uma zona da Ucrânia que tem sido frequentemente atacada desde o início da invasão russa em Fevereiro de 2022. De acordo com o governador da região, duas pessoas foram tratadas por reacções agudas ao stress. O responsável acrescentou que mais pessoas podem estar debaixo dos destroços.

Na capital ucraniana, Kiev, várias explosões foram ouvidas naquele que terá sido um ataque russo à cidade interceptado pela defesa aérea ucraniana.

Segundo o correspondente do Financial Times em Kiev Christopher Miller, as sirenes de ataque aéreo soaram pela cidade cerca de dez minutos antes de as explosões terem soado e o centro da cidade foi visado pelos mísseis.",PT,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor']",força russo ter travar tentativa ucraniano passar fronteira força russo ter impedir tentativa ucraniano atravessar fronteira região russo kursk afirmar terça-feira governador interino região alexeir smirnov madrugada marcar ataque ucrânia Belgorod causar morte pessoa bombardeamento russo kiev kharkiv soldado russo força fronteira serviço federal segurança fsb repelir ataque ucraniano canal mash telegr citar reuter contacto segurança russo afirmar cerca combatente ucraniano ter tentar entrar Rússia sudzha smirnov bombardeamento ucraniano kursk realizar madrugada ter ferir pessoa incluir criança danificar edifício residencial região drone governador abatir durante bombardeamento cidade russo Belgorod pessoa ter morrer ataque drone madrugada governador região Vyacheslav gladkov telegr entretanto ucrânia clínica médico danificar ataque russo kharkiv zona ucrânia ser frequentemente atacar início invasão russo fevereiro acordo governador região pessoa tratar reacção agur stress responsável acrescentar pessoa destroço capital ucraniano kiev várias explosão ouvir ter ser ataque russo cidade interceptar defesa aéreo ucraniano correspondente financial time kiev christopher miller sirene ataque aéreo soar cidade cerca minuto explosão ter soar centro cidade visar míssil

De acordo com o Painel Intergovernamental sobre Alterações Climáticas, as alterações climáticas levarão a um aumento médio do nível do mar global entre 32 a 84 centímetros até 2100.

Os investigadores do serviço de comparação financeira Money.co.uk produziram pósteres de viagens onde imaginam o impacto do aumento dramático do nível do mar em destinos famosos.

Embora exageradas, as obras de arte são uma forma de chamar a atenção para a situação difícil enfrentada por muitas áreas costeiras devido à elevação do nível do mar.

No entanto, existem diversos destinos que provavelmente serão afetados pelo aumento do nível do mar nos próximos cem anos. A equipa criou um mapa de destinos turísticos em todo o mundo que correm o risco de inundar e até desaparecer completamente.

Fiji, um país onde a economia é amplamente dependente do turismo, já começou a ver os efeitos do aumento do nível do mar, com pesquisas a mostrar que o nível das águas continuará a subir para 1-2 metros até 2100, o que coloca a ilha em risco de ser completamente submersa. Seychelles, Ilhas Salomão e Palau também correm o risco de desaparecer até 2100, o que seria uma perda devastadora para o planeta.

Alguns dos destinos turísticos mais populares do mundo, incluindo Londres, Dubai, Tóquio e Rio de Janeiro são vulneráveis ​​a inundações extremas até 2100. Em Dubai, uma elevação de três metros faria com que a cidade perdesse grande parte das suas infraestruturas. Se o nível do mar subir nove metros, Dubai pode ser totalmente submersa, tornando-se a infraestrutura urbana com a vida mais curta da história humana. As Maldivas - famosas pelas suas villas icónicas sobre a água - pode perder até 77% da sua área terrestre para o mar até 2100, segundo alguns especialistas.",PT,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],destino favorito correr risco desaparecer acontecer mar continuar subir acordo painel intergovernamental alteração climática alteração climática levar aumento médio mar global centímetro investigador serviço comparação financeiro money.co.uk produzir póster viagem imaginar impacto aumento dramático mar destino famoso exagerar obra arte chamar atenção situação difícil enfrentar muito área costeiro devido elevação mar entanto existir diverso destino provavelmente ser afetar aumento mar próximo cem ano equipa criar mapa destino turístico mundo correr risco inundar desaparecer completamente fiji país economia amplamente dependente turismo começar efeito aumento mar pesquisa mostrar água continuar subir metro colocar ilha risco completamente submerso seychelles ilha Salomão palau correr risco desaparecer perda devastador planeta destino turístico popular mundo incluir londr Dubai tóquio Rio janeiro vulnerável inundação extrema dubai elevação metro fazer cidade perder infraestrutura mar subir metro Dubai totalmente submerso tornar se infraestrutura urbano vida curto história humano maldiva famoso villa icónico água perder terrestre mar especialista

As tropas ucranianas, cada vez mais parecidas com o Exército de Hitler em 1945, não poderão derrotar as Forças Armadas russas numa luta de atrito, escreve o portal The Conversation.

No seu artigo, Frank Ledwidge, professor sénior de Estratégia e Direito Militar na Universidade de Portsmouth (Reino Unido), reproduz relatos de um amigo analista pró-Ucrânia, ""geralmente muito optimista"", que regressou recentemente da Ucrânia.

Com as tropas ucranianas a perderem terreno, sobretudo nos últimos meses, o analista caracteriza a situação no país dizendo: ""Os ucranianos estão a ser repelidos em todas as frentes – incluindo na região de Kursk, na Rússia [...]. Mais importante ainda, estão a ficar sem soldados.""

A publicação refere a baixa moral e a deserção como problemas graves nas Forças Armadas ucranianas, o que só dificulta o envio de novas forças para a linha da frente.

As tropas ucranianas estão agora a retirar em todas as regiões, incluindo a região russa de Kursk, invadida pelos ucranianos em Agosto deste ano.

O analista citado enfatiza a atmosfera sombria de um briefing com a participação de oficiais militares ocidentais, na qual esteve presente.

Segundo o mesmo, a situação da Ucrânia é avaliada como ""perigosa"" e ""pior do que nunca"" e os militares ocidentais temem que uma catástrofe possa acontecer de repente.

""A História não conhece nenhum exemplo em que defrontar a Rússia num combate de atrito tenha sido bem-sucedido. Sejamos claros: isto significa que há uma possibilidade real de derrota – não há forma de disfarçar isso"", concluiu.

A Rússia lançou uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022 em resposta aos apelos de proteção das Repúblicas Populares de Donetsk e Lugansk (RPD e RPL) contra os bombardeamentos e ataques das tropas ucranianas.

O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, disse que o seu objetivo é ""proteger as pessoas que foram submetidas a abusos e genocídio pelo regime de Kiev durante oito anos"".

Segundo ele, a Rússia tenta há 30 anos chegar a um acordo com a Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) sobre os princípios de segurança na Europa, mas, em resposta, tem enfrentado mentiras cínicas ou tentativas de pressão e chantagem, enquanto, entretanto, e apesar dos protestos de Moscovo, a aliança tem-se expandido constantemente e aproximado das fronteiras da Rússia.

O mesmo acontece com os concorrentes da Bielorrússia, país que apoiou a Rússia na invasão da Ucrânia. De acordo com as últimas informações, 17 bielorrussos vão aos Jogos Olímpicos.

Desde 2018 que os atletas russos não podem competir com a bandeira do seu país. A represália foi motivada por escândalos de doping que envolveram a Rússia nos Jogos Olímpicos de Inverno de Sochi, em 2014.

Em 2021, inclusive, os russos medalhados subiram ao pódio ao som de um fragmento de um concerto de Tchaikovsky sob a bandeira do Comité Olímpico Nacional.

Como é a bandeira dos russos nos Jogos Olímpicos de Paris?

Os atletas russos vão competir com uma bandeira de cor especial, no tom azul esverdeado com a sigla AIN, que significa Atletas Neutros Individuais, forma como serão chamados no evento. Foi também designado um ""hino"" específico para tocar durante as cerimónias de entrega de prémios dos ""atletas neutros"", que não vão entrar em quadros de medalhas.

Os atletas russos foram excluídos da cerimónia de abertura dos Jogos de Paris 2024. Entre os 16 atletas russos que aceitaram o convite estão: tenistas, ginastas de trampolim, natação e canoagem. Apenas foram convidados competidores de desportos individuais.

A Rússia acusa o COI de ""racismo e neonazismo"", dizendo que os responsáveis estão a destruir a ""ideia do espírito olímpico"". Já para o comité, a decisão unânime é considerada lógica. ""Os atletas neutros individuais vão competir como indivíduos, a cerimónia de abertura é um desfile para as delegações e equipas. Não estarão em nenhuma delegação"", disse James MacLeod, diretor do COI para as relações com os comités olímpicos nacionais.

Nenhum governo ou funcionário estatal russo ou bielorrusso foi convidado ou acreditado para os Jogos Olímpicos. Em 2023, o presidente Vladimir Putin declarou-se a favor da participação dos atletas nos Jogos, mas defendeu que seria necessária uma avaliação mais aprofundada sobre o estatuto de ""neutralidade"".

Se as condições do COI são concebidas para isolar os melhores atletas russos e retratar nos Jogos Olímpicos que o desporto russo está a morrer, então é preciso decidir se se participa ou não, disse Vladimir Putin.

Como serão recebidos os atletas russos e bielorrussos em Paris?

O Comité Olímpico da Ucrânia emitiu recomendações para os atletas que vão participar nas competições. O governo sugere que os concorrentes ucranianos não participem em conferências de imprensa com atletas russos e também não sejam fotografados com eles em cerimónias de entrega de medalhas - muitos ucranianos já evitam apertos de mão com adversários russo e bielorrussos.

Na opinião de Volodymyr Zelensky, presidente da Ucrânia, permitir que a Rússia participe nos Jogos é mostrar que ""o terror é de alguma forma aceitável"".

Anne Hidalgo, a presidente da Câmara de Paris, declarou em março que os atletas russos e bielorrussos ""não eram bem-vindos"" nos Jogos.

V. Zakharova, relativamente à crise na Ucrânia

Os tribunais russos, com base nas provas recolhidas pela Comissão de Investigação, continuam a condenar neonazis e mercenários ucranianos por crimes de guerra:

- O militar ucraniano A. Khmara foi condenado a 22 anos de prisão numa colónia de segurança máxima por disparar contra um civil, em Mariupol, como parte de um grupo organizado, em março de 2022.

- O militante das Forças Armadas ucranianas E. Ermolenko foi condenado a 25 anos de prisão. Os seus “cúmplices” - D. Pavlovsky e E. Petrov - foram condenados a 24 anos de prisão cada um por um bombardeamento de morteiro na aldeia Mirny, no distrito de Kalmius, em Mariupol, em março de 2022, que resultou na morte de um civil.

- O mercenário sueco S. K. Mikael foi condenado à revelia a 25 anos de prisão por participar nas hostilidades ao lado do regime de Kiev, em 2014-2015, como parte da formação nacionalista “Azov” contra a milícia DPR e, em 2022, como parte das forças de operações especiais da Ucrânia contra as forças de segurança das repúblicas do Donbass e das Forças Armadas Russas.

Além disso, os mercenários franceses e georgianos, D. K. F. Patrick e R. Burduli, foram condenados à revelia a 14 anos de prisão, e outro cidadão georgiano, G. Kinoiani, foi condenado a 7 anos. Todos estes “soldados da fortuna” foram colocados na lista internacional de procurados.

Até à data, foi concluída a investigação de 59 processos-crime sobre factos de mercenarismo e participação em hostilidades por parte das Forças Armadas Ucranianas. Houve 27 condenações. Deixe-me realçar que estamos a falar do número de decisões tomadas em relação aos mercenários.

Nenhum dos criminosos ucranianos e os seus capangas conseguirão escapar ao castigo inevitável.

Depois de enviarem grandes remessas de armas para o ""saco sem fundo"" do apoio à Ucrânia, os facilitadores europeus de Kiev têm lutado para aumentar a sua própria produção de armas, enfrentando a burocracia, a falta de dinheiro e outros desafios.

As pequenas e médias empresas de defesa europeias estão a lutar para expandir a produção, uma vez que o apoio à Ucrânia continua a sangrar os stocks de armas do Ocidente.

Os fabricantes de armas de fogo têm vindo a sinalizar que a falta de recursos está a ser intensificada pela falta de acesso a financiamento público, pela burocracia e pela relutância dos bancos em conceder empréstimos a participantes mais pequenos do setor, disseram fontes à Reuters.

Enquanto as despesas militares globais dispararam para um máximo histórico de 2,44 triliões de dólares em 2023, de acordo com o Instituto Internacional de Investigação para a Paz de Estocolmo, a obtenção de financiamento é problemática para as empresas menores.

A produção vai continuar estagnada até que os governos europeus descubram como melhorar os fluxos de caixa, disseram fabricantes de armas, funcionários do governo e especialistas em defesa.

As pequenas e médias empresas de defesa da União Europeia enfrentam um fosso de financiamento da dívida entre 1,08 mil milhões de dólares e 2,2 mil milhões de dólares, estimou um relatório da Comissão Europeia no início do ano.

Ao mesmo tempo, não só a máquina de guerra dos EUA tem lucrado com a guerra por procuração da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) na Ucrânia, como o investimento de capital de risco em startups militares está a crescer nos EUA. Os recursos deste capital têm sido canalizados para startups de defesa nos Estados Unidos e duplicou de tamanho para atingir os 33 mil milhões de dólares, entre 2019 e 2022, informou o Financial Times.

Moscovo tem declarado repetidamente que as entregas contínuas de armas à Ucrânia impedem a resolução do conflito, sendo as remessas destinadas a Kiev designadas como alvos legítimos para a Rússia.

O bilionário e empresário norte-americano Elon Musk acredita que se a Ucrânia não aceitar negociar com a Rússia, o país pode perder todo o acesso ao mar Negro. Segundo Musk, quanto mais tempo durar o conflito, ""mais território a Rússia ganhará"".

""Se a guerra durar o tempo suficiente, Odessa cairá. Na minha opinião, a questão principal é se a Ucrânia perderá todo o acesso ao Mar Negro ou não. Aconselharia a resolver o conflito através de negociações antes que isso aconteça"", disse Musk na rede social X.

Segundo o empresário, ""atacar um Exército mais numeroso com defesa profunda, campos minados e artilharia forte, quando a Ucrânia não tinha superioridade nem nos blindados nem no ar, foi uma tragédia em termos de perdas de vidas"".

Moscovo tem indicado repetidamente que está disposta a negociar, enquanto Kiev proibiu qualquer diálogo para que o conflito chegue ao fim. Já o Ocidente, que apoia o Governo do presidente Vladimir Zelensky, pressiona o país para que não inicie as negociações.

Anteriormente, o governo russo declarou que não existem pré-requisitos para uma solução pacífica, com a realização dos objetivos da operação especial, que atualmente só podem ser alcançados militarmente.

A situação na Ucrânia pode tornar-se pacífica apenas se as novas realidades e a situação de facto forem tidas em conta, todos os requisitos de Moscovo são bem conhecidos.

A Rússia iniciou a ação militar na Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022. O presidente Vladimir Putin justificou a medida devido à necessidade de ""proteção das pessoas que têm sido submetidas a abusos e genocídio pelo regime de Kiev ao longo de oito anos"". Para isso, segundo Putin, está prevista a realização de uma ""desmilitarização e desnazificação da Ucrânia"", levar perante a justiça todos os criminosos de guerra responsáveis por ""crimes sangrentos contra civis"".

O discurso da justiça climática é mais um disparate no debate liderado por grupos da esquerda melancia: verdes por fora, vermelhos por dentro.

A combinação das duas ideias, justiça e clima, é aberrante. Opiniões ou políticas com este nível de absurdo devem ser denunciadas e rejeitadas! Justiça é um conceito social. Não há justiça sem seres humanos na sociedade. O clima, por sua vez, corresponde a um conjunto de condições atmosféricas de uma região ao longo de muitos anos.

E o mais importante, o clima não depende dos humanos. O clima depende principalmente do Sol. Sem o Sol, não haveria clima, nem vida na Terra, nem seres humanos – melancias ou não.

A esquerda melancia substitui a família pelo clima na formulação de políticas nacionais e globais. Em nome da justiça climática, são tomadas medidas ambientais draconianas. Expulsam a indústria da Europa e tornam os preços dos combustíveis insustentáveis. Nossa carga tributária sobre o diesel é de 44% e a gasolina é de 51%. Todos nós sabemos as consequências. Transporte e produtos mais caros. Menos oportunidades de emprego. Menos empregos. Menos justiça.

E com tudo a ficar mais caro, ainda temos de pagar por uma transição energética mal concebida. Somos forçados a suportar custos ambientais ignorados por países como a China, que tem quase 200 vezes mais emissões que as nossas. Em Portugal, a justiça climática da esquerda melancia faz sofrer os mais pobres e vulneráveis. Estes portugueses são os que mais sofrem impacto no seu dia a dia o aumento dos preços do cabaz básico.

""Não excluo nenhuma opção"", disse o vice-ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Serguei Riabkov, ao ser questionado sobre a possibilidade de deslocamento de mísseis nucleares caso os Estados Unidos da América (EUA) confirmem a sua decisão, acrescentando que tais ações implicam ""o fim definitivo dos acordos sobre controlo de armamento nessa zona"".

""Nesta situação, tendo em conta as capacidades combinadas dos países que são membros da NATO, devemos avaliar as nossas respostas, sem nenhuma limitação interna em termos de quê, onde e quando se devem ou não devem instalar [os mísseis]. Isso significa que as opções devem ser as mais amplas possíveis"", assinalou o responsável, citado pela agência noticiosa russa Interfax.

Nesse sentido, o vice-ministro referiu que a posição da Rússia ""não constitui uma ameaça para ninguém, apenas procura o processo mais efetivo, também em termos de custos, para responder a desafios em mutação"".

Riabkov também garantiu que as autoridades russas vão garantir a segurança do enclave russo de Kaliningrado (um enclave russo no Báltico com fronteira com a Lituânia e a Polónia, dois países da União Europeia e da NATO), que ""atrai desde há muito a atenção dos adversários"".

""Caso os representantes do Governo da Alemanha considerem justificado iniciar medidas para uma escalada sob o pretexto da situação na região, responderemos com medidas de compensação da forma que considerarmos mais aceitável"", sublinhou.

""Nada nos deterá na hora de solucionar os problemas para a nossa segurança em todo o perímetro das fronteiras russas"", frisou.

Na semana passada, Riabkov tinha considerado que ""a natureza da reação"" da Rússia -- caso os EUA decidam essa medida e que implicaria o primeiro envio norte-americano deste armamento para a Alemanha desde o final da Guerra Fria -- ""será decidida com calma e de forma profissional"".

O anúncio dos Estados Unidos e da Alemanha indica, segundo recordou hoje a agência espanhola Europa Press, que a instalação dos mísseis de longo alcance tem por objetivo demonstrar o ""compromisso"" de Washington com a NATO e uma contribuição para a ""dissuasão integrada europeia"", especificando-se que ""estas unidades convencionais de longo alcance incluirão (mísseis) SM-6, Tomahawk e armas hipersónicas de última geração, com um raio significativamente maior face aos atuais materiais terrestres na Europa"".

Em paralelo, os Estados Unidos e quatro países europeus -- Países Baixos, Alemanha, Itália e Roménia -- anunciaram na quarta-feira o envio de sistemas de defesa antiaérea para a Ucrânia na sequência da última vaga de ataques russos que provocou 40 mortos e 170 feridos, no âmbito da invasão militar ordenada em fevereiro de 2022 pelo Presidente Vladimir Putin.",PT,"['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Overpraising the West']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Overpraising the West: The West has the strongest international support']",Rússia admitir deslocar míssil EUA colocar longo alcance alemanha excluor opção dizer vice-ministro negócio estrangeiro russo serguei riabkov questionar possibilidade deslocamento míssil nuclear caso Estados Unidos América EUA confirmar decisão acrescentar ação implicar definitivo acordo controlo armamento zona situação ter conta capacidade combinar país membro nato dever avaliar resposta limitação interno termos instalar míssel significar opção ampla possível assinalar responsável citar agência noticioso russa interfax sentido vice-ministro referir Rússia constituir ameaça ninguém procurar processo efetivo termos custo responder desafio mutação riabkov garantir autoridade russo garantir segurança enclave russo kaliningrado enclave russo báltico fronteira lituânia polónia país união europeu nato atrair haver atenção adversário caso representante governo alemanha consider justificar medida escalada pretexto situação região responderer medida compensação considerarr aceitável sublinhar deter hora solucionar problema segurança perímetro fronteira russo frisar semana passado riabkov ter considerar natureza reação rússia caso EUA decidar medida implicar envio norte-americano armamento alemanha guerra fria ser decidir calma profissional anúncio Estados Unidos Alemanha indicar recordar hoje agência espanhol Europa Press instalação míssil longo alcance objetivo demonstrar compromisso Washington nato contribuição dissuasão integrar europeu especificar se unidade convencional longo alcance incluir míssil Sm- tomahawk arma hipersónico último geração raio significativamente face atual material terrestre Europa paralelo Estados Unidos país europeu país baixo Alemanha Itália roménia anunciar quarta-feira envio sistema defesa antiaéreo ucrânia sequência último vaga ataque russo provocar morto ferir âmbito invasão militar ordenar fevereiro presidente vladimir putin

O tufão Yagi, que começou no início da semana passada, provocou uma tragédia no Sudeste Asiático, contabilizando 276 mortes esta quinta-feira, dia 12. A tempestade passou pelas Filipinas, China, Vietname, Laos, Tailândia e Myanmar, deixando um rasto de destruição na sua passagem.

O Vietname foi o país mais afetado, com 226 mortes confirmadas e centenas de desaparecidos. A tempestade trouxe ventos devastadores e inundações que paralisaram a região. Muitas áreas foram deixadas sem energia elétrica e estruturas importantes foram destruídas.

Impactos do tufão Yagi no Vietname

A região norte do Vietname, especialmente, sofreu grandemente com o tufão Yagi. Ventos até 149 km/h arrancaram telhados, destruíram pontes e danificaram fábricas. Mais de 104 pessoas continuam desaparecidas, e os receios de que o número de mortos aumente são elevados.

Segundo dados da Unicef, mais de 140 mil casas foram destruídas pelas cheias e deslizamentos de terras. Hanói, a capital, e os seus arredores foram duramente atingidos, afetando mais de 15 mil habitantes. Na província montanhosa de Lao Cai, um deslizamento de terras devastou uma aldeia inteira, resultando em 46 mortos, 17 feridos e 55 desaparecidos.

Além disso, os danos não se limitaram às áreas residenciais. O Ministério da Agricultura vietnamita informou que o tufão destruiu mais de 250 mil hectares de áreas cultivadas. No sector pecuário perderam-se 1,5 milhões de aves e 2500 porcos, búfalos e vacas, agravando a crise alimentar no país.

Outros países atingidos

O tufão Yagi também causou estragos noutros países do Sudeste Asiático. Em Myanmar, foram encontrados 17 corpos em bairros inundados na região de Mandalay. As condições foram mais severas nas proximidades de Naypyidaw e Taungu. O governo montou 50 acampamentos para os desalojados.

Na Tailândia, foram confirmadas 9 mortes, seis delas em deslizamentos de terras na província de Chiang Mai. Já o distrito de Mae Sai, junto à fronteira com Myanmar, sofreu uma das piores cheias dos últimos 80 anos. A China e as Filipinas também reportaram danos, com várias mortes e feridos.

Como é que a crise climática influencia?

Estudos recentes indicam que os tufões estão a formar-se mais perto da costa e a intensificar-se rapidamente devido à crise climática. O tufão Shanshan, que atingiu o Japão recentemente, é um exemplo de eventos climáticos extremos que se estão a tornar mais comuns.

Pesquisas da Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) mostram que a frequência de eventos climáticos extremos como inundações, tempestades e deslizamentos de terra mais do que triplicou nos últimos 50 anos por causa do aquecimento global. O IPCC (Painel Intergovernamental para as Alterações Climáticas) já afirmou que a ação humana é parcialmente responsável por estas mudanças.

Com a intensificação dos tufões, a necessidade de medidas de adaptação e mitigação torna-se crucial. Os países do Sudeste Asiático devem trabalhar em conjunto e com a comunidade internacional para desenvolver estratégias eficazes contra futuros desastres climáticos.

""A economia russa está atualmente a crescer fortemente graças ao 'boom' da defesa"", revela Vasily Astrov, especialista em assuntos russos do Instituto de Estudos Económicos Internacionais de Viena (wiiw).

No entanto, revela, ""as sanções podem funcionar como um veneno que atua lentamente"", destacou o especialista a propósito das conclusões do estudo encomendando pelo ministério alemão dos Assuntos Económicos e da Ação Climática.

Em 2023, um ano depois do início da guerra, o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) da Rússia cresceu 3,6%. Já este ano o primeiro-ministro, Mikhail Mishustin, anunciou um avanço de 5% nos primeiros cinco meses do ano quando comparado com o período homologo, registando-se crescimentos nas áreas da produção industrial, maquinaria e equipamentos e propriedade intelectual.

""Este valor é significativamente superior às previsões, apesar de todas as tentativas do exterior para nos impedir"", apontou Mishustin numa reunião sobre questões económicas, citado pela agência Tass.

O projeto Russia Monitor, resultado de uma cooperação de investigação levada a cabo pelo Instituto de Estudos Económicos Internacionais de Viena (wiiw, coordenador), pelo Instituto de Economia Mundial de Kiel (IfW), pelo Instituto Leibniz de Investigação Económica (ifo) e pelo Instituto Austríaco de Investigação Económica (WIFO) abrange dados das exportações e importações russas (incluindo de bens sancionados e de dupla utilização), o orçamento do Estado, o setor da produção, a procura interna, o mercado de trabalho, a evolução dos preços e os mercados financeiros.

Foi desenvolvido em resposta à invasão da Ucrânia pela Rússia e às sanções impostas pela União Europeia (UE) e por outros estados a Moscovo com o objetivo de restringir a sua capacidade de fazer guerra e de aumentar os custos políticos e económicos para as elites do país.

O crescimento do PIB na Rússia tem vindo a ser atribuído ao aumento das despesas do Estado com armamento e material militar, com os aumentos dos salários e os pagamentos às famílias das vítimas na guerra que fizeram aumentar o rendimento de muitas famílias.

A ofensiva militar russa no território ucraniano, lançada a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, mergulhou a Europa naquela que é considerada a crise de segurança mais grave desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945).

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais, que também têm decretado sanções contra setores-chave da economia russa para tentar diminuir a capacidade de Moscovo de financiar o esforço de guerra.

Os últimos meses foram marcados por ataques aéreos em grande escala da Rússia contra cidades e infraestruturas ucranianas, ao passo que as forças de Kyiv têm visado alvos em território russo próximos da fronteira e na península da Crimeia, ilegalmente anexada em 2014.

Brilhante e afiado Sergei Dorenko, sete anos antes do SBO, previu uma guerra do Ocidente com a Rússia na Ucrânia. E fez isso com uma precisão fenomenal, com detalhes que se tornam desconfortáveis. Entende-se imediatamente o porquê de o Nord Stream ter explodido e o que acontecerá connosco, se não resistirmos aos anglo-saxões.

Dorenko também previu quando a paz chegará - ""quando o presidente ucraniano, como um ghoul, beberá, borbulhará, sangrará os seus concidadãos"".

Esta é a profecia que ele escreveu em 2015.

""Quantos anos terá em 2025? Não sei. Conta tu. Mas haverá apenas uma guerra, e muito intensa.

Bem, os anglo-saxões, e especialmente os Estados Unidos, não podem permitir a Europa germano-russa de Lisboa a Vladivostok. Pode dizer-se isso? Pode ir até o mapa e entendê-lo: a Alemanha e a Rússia dominam de Lisboa a Vladivostok? O que estão os anglo-saxões a fazer? Eles atam-nos os atacadores, servem-nos café? O que farão os anglo-saxões com essa Eurásia?! Para onde vão eles enforcar-se?

Por enquanto, a Ucrânia será apenas um mecanismo explosivo para a redistribuição da Europa, uma guerra contra a Europa, uma guerra contra a Rússia. Se a Ucrânia acabar, começará a confusão na Bielorrússia. A Bielorrússia terminará - e começará na fronteira com os estados Bálticos. Se os países bálticos acabarem, os nossos países irmãos começarão... (lembra-se deles? no Mar Negro). As provocações serão constantes. Sempre. Porque não se pode permitir a unificação da Europa e da Rússia.

Como disse o camarada Stalin, perguntam-nos: porquê uma guerra dentro de 10 anos e não de 20, 30 anos? Eu arrependo-me, pessoal, eu vejo por 10 anos, mas eu não tenho um horizonte de planeamento a 20 anos. Não é grande coisa... E daqui a 30 não sei o que vai acontecer. Muita coisa vai mudar em 20 anos.

Bem, 10 anos para mim é absolutamente claro: vamos dobrar, quebrar muito a sério. A tarefa não é apenas resistir. O objetivo é sair mais forte. Como vamos fazer isso, eu não sei, não sei como. Mas sei que vamos fazê-lo. Senão, vamos desmoronar-nos e ninguém se lembrará da nossa existência. Entende?

E, ao longo do caminho, teremos que restaurar a ordem na Ucrânia.

Bem, agora não, não às zero horas de domingo. Ainda é cedo. A histeria nazi ucraniana ainda não bebeu sangue ucraniano.

Depois de mais um par de anos de guerra, depois de um par de presidentes em Kiev, depois da destilação das reuniões de Minsk, o presidente ucraniano, como um ghoul borbulhando o sangue dos seus concidadãos, borbulhando o sangue dos ucranianos, um ghoul nojento bêbado, estará pronto para assinar um mundo real, não um mundo de brinquedos.

Esperamos pacientemente.

Os resultados de um estudo divulgado pela NASA, baseado em dados de satélite e modelos climáticos avançados, revelam que o aumento das temperaturas e da humidade está a levar determinadas áreas para além dos limites da habitabilidade humana.

De acordo com os cientistas, quando este índice ultrapassa os 35°C durante longos períodos, o corpo humano não consegue regular eficazmente a sua temperatura, o que pode levar a condições potencialmente letais.

Projeções alarmantes

Colin Raymond, investigador do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jacto da NASA no Sul da Califórnia e autor principal de um estudo de 2020 sobre o calor e a humidade extrema, publicado na Science Advances, indica que os níveis extremos de stress térmico duplicaram nas últimas décadas, com projeções alarmantes para o futuro próximo.

Raymond diz que este fenómeno se intensifica especialmente em zonas como o Golfo Pérsico e o Mar Vermelho, onde as temperaturas extremas e a humidade poderão transformar estas zonas em verdadeiros desertos.

A capacidade dos seres humanos de dissipar calor de forma eficiente permitiu-nos espalhar-nos por todos os continentes, mas uma temperatura de bolbo húmido (TW) de 35°C marca o nosso limite fisiológico superior, e valores muito mais baixos têm graves impactos na saúde e na produtividade.

Os modelos climáticos projetam as primeiras ocorrências de TW de 35°C para meados do século XXI. No entanto, uma avaliação abrangente dos dados das estações meteorológicas mostra que algumas zonas costeiras subtropicais já registaram uma temperatura máxima de 35°C e que a frequência de calor húmido extremo em geral mais do que duplicou desde 1979.

Que lugares estão em perigo?

Estas seriam algumas das regiões mais vulneráveis:

Sul da Ásia, onde são esperadas temperaturas críticas entre 2040 e 2070. Países como o Paquistão podem enfrentar condições extremas que ponham em perigo a vida humana se não forem tomadas medidas imediatas. O Golfo Pérsico, com temperaturas já extremamente elevadas, corre o risco de se tornar completamente inabitável. Na América do Sul, o Brasil é outro dos países destacados no relatório. A China, especialmente o leste do país, também enfrenta um futuro incerto. Nos Estados Unidos, várias áreas do Arkansas e do Missouri também estão em risco.

Stress térmico

Os cientistas recorreram ao índice de bulbo húmido para avaliar a crescente ameaça do stress térmico, o qual integra tanto a temperatura ambiente como a humidade do ar.

Este índice é crucial para medir a capacidade do corpo humano de dissipar o calor através da transpiração, destacando, assim, condições extremas que poderiam ultrapassar os limites de tolerância fisiológica. Este enfoque permite identificar as regiões mais vulneráveis ao aumento do calor global e realça a urgência de adotar medidas preventivas para proteger a saúde pública.

O aquecimento global não é um jogo

O relatório do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jacto da NASA é apenas um lembrete urgente da necessidade de ações globais coordenadas para lidar com a crise climática. De acordo com os investigadores, à medida que as temperaturas globais continuam a aumentar, é essencial não só reduzir as emissões de gases com efeito de estufa, mas também adaptar as nossas comunidades e economias a um clima em mudança.

O conselheiro presidencial ucraniano Mykhailo Podolyak garantiu, esta sexta-feira, que a decisão de interromper o trânsito de petróleo russo da empresa Lukoil através do seu território ""não tem nada a ver com chantagem"", mas sim com sanções de Kyiv.

A declaração do conselheiro de Volodymyr Zelensky, enviada à agência de notícias Reuters, surge após a Hungria e a Eslováquia terem pedido à Comissão Europeia a mediação com a Ucrânia, que incluiu a petrolífera Lukoil na sua lista de sanções, provocando o fim do trânsito de petróleo para os dois países através do oleoduto Druzhba.

Na segunda-feira, o porta-voz do governo húngaro, Zoltan Kovacs, alertou que ""a decisão da Ucrânia de não permitir à Lukoil o trânsito de petróleo através da Ucrânia implica uma ameaça fundamental para a segurança dos fornecimentos energéticos à Hungria e à Eslováquia"".

Já esta sexta-feira, em conferência de imprensa, Gergely Gulyas, chefe do gabinete do primeiro-ministro húngaro, afirmou que a Ucrânia estava a chantagear a Hungria e a Eslováquia que ""defendem a paz e o cessar-fogo"".

No entanto, Podolyak assegurou agora que ""a situação com a suspensão do trânsito de petróleo russo através do oleoduto Druzhba para a Hungria e Eslováquia não tem nada a ver com chantagem na versão ucraniana"", disse Podolyak num comentário escrito.

""A Hungria e a Eslováquia não se apresentam como verdadeiros guardiões da paz e não insistem na paz e na justiça, mas apenas em concessões à Rússia"", atirou.

Sublinhe-se que o primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, e o seu homólogo eslovaco, Robert Fico, ambos definidos de ""pró-russos"", têm-se oposto ao apoio militar à Ucrânia na sequência da invasão russa e defendem uma solução negociada para terminar com o conflito.

""Vemos o lançamento destes mísseis balísticos como um meio absolutamente legal e legítimo"", disse o vice-ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo Mikhail Rudenko, citado pela agência EFE.

Segundo Rudenko, um dos nove vices do ministro Serguei Lavrov, trata-se de ""uma resposta às crescentes ameaças contra a Coreia do Norte, contra toda a península coreana, devido à política dos Estados Unidos e dos seus aliados"".

A Rússia criticou no passado os lançamentos de mísseis balísticos pela Coreia do Norte.

Rudenko disse aos jornalistas em Moscovo que a Coreia do Norte não é obrigada a informar a Rússia dos lançamentos, uma vez que se trata de um país soberano.

O Estado-Maior Conjunto da Coreia do Sul (JCS) e o Ministério da Defesa do Japão detetaram hoje lançamentos norte-coreanos, que ocorreram pouco antes do início das eleições presidenciais norte-americanas.

Pyongyang já tinha lançado um míssil balístico intercontinental (ICBM) na quinta-feira.

A Rússia e a Coreia do Norte têm incrementado as relações sobretudo depois da invasão russa da Ucrânia, em fevereiro de 2022.

A Coreia do Sul, a Ucrânia e os Estados Unidos denunciaram nos últimos dias que Pyongyang enviou cerca de 10.000 soldados para a Rússia alegadamente para combaterem as forças ucranianas, nomeadamente na região russa de Kursk.

A Coreia do Norte e a Rússia não confirmaram explicitamente o destacamento norte-coreano, mas argumentaram que a sua cooperação militar está em conformidade com as leis internacionais.

Seul tem alertado para a possibilidade de a Rússia transferir tecnologia militar para a Coreia do Norte, incluindo de âmbito nuclear, como recompensa pelo envio de tropas para a guerra contra a Ucrânia.

Rudenko afirmou que o acordo de parceria estratégica global assinado pelos dois países ""não prevê a criação de uma aliança militar e não representa uma ameaça para países terceiros"".

Segundo o vice-ministro, o acordo respeita o direito internacional, não é conflituoso e não altera a arquitetura de segurança no Nordeste da Ásia.

""A assinatura do acordo não é mais do que um passo conjunto de Moscovo e Pyongyang para repensar as abordagens para garantir a segurança no contexto de tendências político-militares alarmantes"", argumentou.

O diplomata russo aludiu ainda à visita da ministra dos Negócios Estrangeiros norte-coreana, Choe Son-hui, concluída hoje.

Referiu que as duas partes realizaram consultas estratégicas, tendo sido discutidas questões de segurança e económicas, incluindo ""todas as questões decorrentes"" do tratado de parceria, que inclui uma cláusula de assistência mútua em caso de agressão.

Rudenko negou ainda ter conhecimento de que a Rússia tencione aumentar o fornecimento de arroz à Coreia do Norte para 600.000-700.000 toneladas.

Choe iniciou a visita à Rússia em 29 de outubro.

Em Lisboa, esta manhã, apoiantes do coletivo Climáximo tingiram de vermelho a água da fonte do edifício da Caixa Geral de Depósitos, onde se encontram vários ministérios do Governo. Com este ato, o grupo quis chamar a atenção para aquilo que consideram ser uma proposta de Orçamento do Estado (OE) que “alimenta a crise climática,” descrevendo-a como “criminosa” e acusando o Governo de ter “sangue nas mãos” por, na sua visão, não tomar medidas para enfrentar a crise ambiental. Em comunicado, o Climáximo convoca ainda a sociedade para uma manifestação e ação de resistência marcada para o próximo dia 23 de novembro, sob o mote “Parar Enquanto Podemos.”

Alice Gato, uma das porta-vozes do Climáximo, critica a discussão pública sobre o Orçamento do Estado, acusando os debates parlamentares de ignorarem as consequências sociais e ambientais das políticas públicas. “Durante semanas, a discussão sobre o Orçamento tem-se focado em jogos de bastidores, com os media a relatarem tudo como se fosse uma novela. A crise climática, a maior ameaça que a humanidade enfrenta, não foi sequer uma nota de rodapé. Entre dramas partidários, IRS jovem e IRC, as políticas necessárias para travar o colapso ficaram de fora,” afirmou.

O coletivo Climáximo enxerga o OE e as decisões dos ministérios envolvidos como parte de uma tendência para normalizar, segundo os ativistas, a violência das políticas governamentais e empresariais contra a vida e o ambiente. Alice Gato sublinha que, tal como na 29ª Conferência das Nações Unidas pelo Clima (COP29), a realizar-se em novembro, o Orçamento do Estado revela, para o Climáximo, que os Governos não estão dispostos a reverter a situação: “Pelo contrário, estão a acelerar rumo ao inferno climático. Este é o Orçamento de um estado de guerra. Continuam a empurrar-nos para um mundo de incêndios devastadores, secas intensas, colheitas perdidas e cheias catastróficas, como as que já causaram 51 mortos em Valência desde ontem. Está em jogo tudo o que as pessoas valorizam: justiça, democracia, condições de vida dignas e um planeta habitável,” declarou.

Para o coletivo, este cenário exige mais do que respostas institucionais, que consideram vazias e insuficientes para fazer face ao avanço da crise climática. “A mudança necessária não virá dos gabinetes dos ministros. Será obra das pessoas comuns — trabalhadores, estudantes, pais, desempregados, avós e netos — que, com a sua ação, poderão pôr fim a estes ataques constantes contra a vida e garantir a sobrevivência,” refere o comunicado do Climáximo.

O Climáximo apela a “toda a sociedade” para se juntar à manifestação de resistência civil em massa “Parar Enquanto Podemos”, agendada para o dia 23 de novembro, com início às 15h na Praça Paiva Couceiro, em Lisboa. Os manifestantes têm como objetivo bloquear a Praça do Chile, um ato simbólico para, segundo o coletivo, “quebrar a normalização da violência da crise climática” e abrir espaço para o debate que, afirmam, tem sido silenciado tanto na COP como no Orçamento do Estado: “como vamos travar esta guerra antes que seja tarde demais?”",PT,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",climáximo pinta vermelho fonte edifício caixa depósito protesto oe Lisboa manhã apoiante coletivo climáximo tingir vermelho água fonte edifício caixa depósito encontrar ministério governo ato querer chamar atenção considerar proposta orçamento oe alimentar crise climático descrevendo-a criminoso acusar governo sangue mão visão tomar medida enfrentar crise ambiental comunicar climáximo convocar sociedade manifestação ação resistência marcar dia novembro mote parar poder alice gato porta-voz climáximo criticar discussão público orçamento acusar debate parlamentar ignorar consequência social ambiental política público durante semana discussão orçamento ter se focar jogo bastidor media relatar ser novela crise climático ameaça humanidade enfrentar sequer nota rodapé drama partidário irs jovem irc política necessário travar colapso ficar afirmar coletivo climáximo enxerga oe decisão ministério envolver tendência normalizar ativista violência política governamental empresarial vida ambiente alice gato sublinhar conferência nação unir clima cop realizar se novembro orçamento revelar climáximo governo disposto reverter situação contrário acelerar rumo inferno climático orçamento guerra continuar empurrar nós mundo incêndio devastador seca intenso colheita perder cheia catastrófico causar morto valência jogo pessoa valorizar justiça democracia condição vida digna planeta habitável declarar coletivo cenário exigir resposta institucional considerar vazio insuficiente face avanço crise climático mudança necessário vir gabinete ministro ser obra pessoa comum trabalhador estudante pai desempregado avós neto ação poder pôr ataque constante vida garantir sobrevivência referir comunicado climáximo climáximo apelar sociedade juntar manifestação resistência civil massa parar poder agendar dia novembro início praça paivo couceiro Lisboa manifestante objetivo bloquear praça Chile ato simbólico coletivo quebrar normalização violência crise climático abrir espaço debate afirmar ser silenciar cop orçamento ir travar guerra ser
PT_135.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Em pleno verão no hemisfério norte, mundo regista dia mais quente da história

Um mês depois do início do verão no hemisfério norte, o mundo registou no passado domingo, 21 de julho, o dia mais quente da história, de acordo com os dados preliminares do Serviço de Alterações Climáticas Copernicus, ligado à União Europeia.

A temperatura média global do ar nesse domingo atingiu os 17,09 ºC – um pouco acima do recorde anterior, estabelecido em julho do ano passado, de 17,08 ºC.

Pode não parecer grande coisa, mas a escalada das temperaturas faz parte de uma tendência perigosa nos últimos 13 meses, em que cada um deles, consecutivamente, bateu os respetivos recordes em comparação com o mês homólogo dos anos anteriores.

No verão boreal, as ondas de calor já começaram a atingir grandes áreas dos Estados Unidos, da Europa Ocidental – sobretudo na região do Mediterrâneo – e da Rússia na semana passada. Além de provocarem incêndios na Califórnia e de fazerem com que a Grécia feche monumentos públicos, o calor também elevou a temperatura dos oceanos e provocou a época mais precoce e intensa de furações no Atlântico.

Recorde anterior

O instituto Copernicus confirmou à agência noticiosa Reuters que o recorde médio diário de temperatura estabelecido no ano passado foi batido no domingo, de acordo com os seus registos, que remontam ao ano de 1940.

No ano passado, quatro dias consecutivos bateram este recorde, de 3 a 6 de julho. É o resultado direto dos efeitos das alterações climáticas, impulsionadas pela queima de combustíveis fósseis, que provocaram ondas de calor cada vez mais extremas e temperaturas progressivamente mais elevadas em todo o planeta.

Alguns cientistas sugerem que 2024 poderá superar 2023 como o ano mais quente da história da Terra, uma vez que as alterações climáticas e o fenómeno natural El Niño – que terminou em Abril – aumentaram ainda mais as temperaturas este ano.

O Primeiro-Ministro Luís Montenegro declarou recentemente nas Nações Unidas, em Nova Iorque, que “Portugal mantém-se empenhado em investir nas energias renováveis e na supressão dos combustíveis de origem fóssil”, acrescentando que “queremos incorporar 47% de energias renováveis no consumo final de energia até 2030”.

O chefe do atual governo minoritário do PSD/AD não especificou a Fonte de Energia Renovável, e como é que o Governo vai atingir tal meta em apenas seis anos. Neste sentido, importa ainda questionar qual a capacidade (MW) de produção de energia renovável nacional a atingir em 2030; e se a meta resulta do aumento da produção já significativa de biomassa florestal, que contribuiu cerca de 45% do total produzido em 2019, segundo dados oficiais de 2021. Por outro lado, estaremos perante a continuidade das anteriores políticas socialistas, que têm resultado na exploração acelerada e mercantilista dos recursos florestais em Portugal?

A Zero – Associação Sistema Terrestre Sustentável, e a Biofuelwatch, salientam que, após os violentos incêndios florestais em 2003, os sucessivos governos têm defendido a produção de energia a partir da biomassa florestal “como forma de reduzir o risco de incêndio”, questionando a estratégia governamental na sequência de incêndios ainda mais devastadores em 2017 nas regiões centro e norte do país, e novamente no mês passado, desta vez, sete anos depois.

Dados oficias, citados por estas organizações, indicam que, no final de 2020, existiam em Portugal 21 centrais de biomassa licenciadas, exigindo anualmente cerca de 4 milhões de toneladas de material florestal, correspondendo a um total de 283 MW. Em 2019, o Governo aprovou a instalação de novas centrais de biomassa a nível municipal, prevendo mais 60 MW. Em 2020, Portugal exportou cerca de 545000 toneladas de pellets de madeira da floresta portuguesa, o equivalente a 64% da produção total, para a Dinamarca, Reino Unido, Espanha e Países Baixos queimarem em centrais de carvão convertidas na produção de eletricidade e outros fins industriais. Em Portugal, a grande indústria da pasta de papel também “queima licor negro, resíduos de eucalipto e biomassa florestal em oito centrais”, segundo as organizações de defesa da floresta.

Cinco dias após a intervenção do chefe do Governo na ONU, o Ministério do Ambiente e Energia, através do Fundo Ambiental, anunciou a aprovação de 22 projetos com um financiamento total de 83 milhões de euros para “alcançar a capacidade total de 178,5 MW na produção de hidrogénio e outros gases renováveis”, sem especificar o tipo de “gases”, defendendo que os “projetos contribuem para os objetivos climáticos de Portugal”.

Será que vão construir novas centrais de biomassa no país até 2030? E onde? Em que medida é que os gases poluentes que, por exemplo, são despejados 24/7 na atmosfera às portas de Arganil, contribuem para a qualidade do ar e os objetivos climáticos de Portugal? Queimar madeira da floresta para a produção industrial de energia reduz o risco de incêndio?

Um comandante de batalhão da 58.ª Brigada do Exército da Ucrânia abandonou a sua unidade perto da cidade de Krasnoarmeisk (Pokrovsk, na denominação ucraniana) e fugiu do campo de batalha para a retaguarda, disse à Sputnik Vladimir Soblovoi, um antigo combatente de 49 anos, que foi capturado no início de setembro.

Soblovoi disse que já não tem confiança nem no atual líder ucraniano Vladimir Zelensky, nem na liderança militar da Ucrânia.

""Não acredito neles. Não acredito em Zelensky, não acredito no meu comandante e não acredito em ninguém. Porque ele [o comandante] enviou-nos para a morte. É tudo. Como percebi, fomos para lá. O ataque começou e todos os fugiram"", contou o prisioneiro de guerra.

Segundo ele, o comandante persuadiu os soldados a irem para a linha da frente perto de Krasnoarmeisk, prometendo que seriam substituídos seis dias depois, mas passaram vinte dias e não foram substituídos.

Observou a baixa moral da 58.ª Brigada, na qual serviu durante vários meses. ""Está mau, a moral está muito má. Todos querem voltar para casa.""

De acordo com o prisioneiro, ele e mais três tinham decidido antecipadamente render-se se o ataque às suas posições começasse. Quando lhe perguntaram se estava pessoalmente com medo de se render, Soblovoi respondeu negativamente. ""Não tive medo. Medo de quê? [Os russos] são cristãos como nós"", disse o homem.

Segundo Soblovoi, antes da mobilização, vivia no oeste da Ucrânia e trabalhava como engenheiro de peças num escritório de representação de um fabricante de automóveis ocidental. Acabou por ser alistado nas Forças Armadas ucranianas depois de receber uma convocatória. Disse que não se esquivou à mobilização, porque temia que o seu filho fosse privado dos seus direitos se não servisse.

A Rússia lançou uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022 em resposta aos apelos de proteção das Repúblicas Populares de Donetsk e Lugansk (RPD e RPL) contra os bombardeamentos e ataques das tropas ucranianas.

O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, disse que o seu objetivo é ""proteger as pessoas que foram submetidas a abusos e genocídio pelo regime de Kiev durante oito anos"".

Segundo Putin, a Rússia tenta há 30 anos chegar a um acordo com a Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) sobre os princípios de segurança na Europa, mas, em resposta, tem enfrentado mentiras cínicas ou tentativas de pressão e chantagem , enquanto, entretanto, e apesar dos protestos de Moscovo, a aliança tem-se expandido constantemente e aproximado das fronteiras da Rússia.

No frio, um inseto com o corpo mais escuro é melhor para capturar um parceiro sexual do que um ""rival"" com estrutura brilhante. Os machos mais escuros podem aquecer-se mais facilmente no início da manhã e, portanto, conseguem mais tempo para o acasalamento enquanto os outros ainda se estão a aquecer.

Esse é um dos muitos exemplos de como a temperatura afeta a coloração dos insetos e, por sua vez, pode afetar a sua capacidade de acasalar, de acordo com um novo artigo de revisão publicado na revista Ecology and Evolution e divulgado pelo Guardian.

Os cientistas ainda tentam descobrir o que acontecerá à vida sexual dos insetos, agora que o colapso climático produzido pelo homem aumenta as temperaturas para níveis sem precedentes.

“Por um lado, poderíamos estar alegres, dizendo: como estão os insetos? Eles estão a responder às mudanças climáticas. Não precisamos de nos preocupar com eles”, disse Mariella Herberstein, ecologista comportamental da Universidade Macquarie em Sydney, Austrália, que é uma das autoras do estudo.

A teoria predominante entre os cientistas, diz Herberstein, é que quando as temperaturas aumentam, os insetos evoluem em grande parte para produzir menos pigmento que regula a sua tonalidade, tornando-se mais claros e brilhantes. Isso ocorre porque os objetos mais escuros absorvem mais calor e aquecem mais rapidamente, enquanto os objetos mais claros refletem mais radiação e podem permanecer mais frios por mais tempo.

Por exemplo, as cores das asas de algumas borboletas das montanhas norte-americanas foram desbotando ao longo do tempo à medida que as temperaturas aumentaram – as asas amarelo-enxofre cintilantes tornaram-se mais pálidas, de acordo com um estudo de 2016.

Entre as décadas de 1980 e 2000, tornou-se cada vez menos provável que a joaninha de duas pintas fosse preta com manchas vermelhas em vez de vermelha com manchas pretas.

Mas a equipa de Herberstein descobriu que o padrão nem sempre é tão simples. Um estudo de acompanhamento sobre as borboletas Meadii, que analisou mais de 800 animais reunidos para amostras de museus entre 1953 e 2013, descobriu que, em algumas áreas, as suas asas amarelas ficaram com cores mais ricas e mais escuras ao longo do tempo.

“O mecanismo não é tão claro – é confuso”, disse outro dos autores do estudo, Tonmoy Haque, doutorando na Universidade Macquarie. Isto pode acontecer porque os investigadores estão a trabalhar com um conjunto limitado de dados que provêm de estudos semelhantes com insetos parecidos, diz ele. Provavelmente também porque a melanina não tem apenas uma função relacionada com o calor, mas está envolvida nas defesas imunológicas e ajuda a proteger contra a radiação ultravioleta do sol.",PT,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming'],crise climático impactar vida sexual inseto estudo frio inseto corpo escuro bom capturar parceiro sexual rival estrutura brilhante macho escuro aquecer se facilmente início manhã conseguir acasalamento aquecer exemplo temperatura afetar coloração inseto afetar capacidade acasalar acordo artigo revisão publicar revista ecology and evolution divulgar guardian cientista tentar descobrir acontecer vida sexual inseto colapso climático produzir homem aumentar temperatura nível precedente poderíar alegre dizer inseto responder mudança climático precisar preocupar dizer mariella herberstein ecologista comportamental universidade macquarie Sydney austráliar autora estudo teoria predominante cientista herberstein temperatura aumentar inseto evoluem produzir pigmento regular tonalidade tornar se claro brilhante ocorrer objeto escuro absorver calor aquecer rapidamente objeto claro refletir radiação permanecer frio cor asa borboleta montanha norte-americano desbotar longo medida temperatura aumentar asa amarelo-enxofre cintilante tornar se pálido acordo estudo década tornar se provável joaninha pinta ser preto mancha vermelho vermelha mancha preto equipa herberstein descobrir padrão simples estudo acompanhamento borboleta meadiir analisar animal reunir amostra museu descobrir área asa Amarelas ficar cor rico escura longo mecanismo claro confuso dizer outro autor estudo tonmoy haque doutorar universidade macquarie acontecer investigador trabalhar conjunto limitar dado provir estudo semelhante inseto parecir provavelmente melanina função relacionar calor envolvido defesa imunológico ajudar proteger radiação ultraviolet sol

Os ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia e da China reuniram-se, esta quinta-feira (25), e conversaram sobre a construção de ""uma nova arquitetura de segurança"", informou Moscovo, após o encontro que decorreu à margem da reunião de ministros da Associação Nacional do Sudeste Asiático (Asean), em Laos.

Na reunião, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Serguei Lavrov, e o seu homólogo chinês, Wang Yi, analisaram em ""pormenor"" temas de cooperação no âmbito da Asean, declarou o ministro russo, num comunicado publicado após o encontro em Vientiane, na capital de Laos.

Lavrov afirmou que, numa altura em que “alguns países” estão a criar “uma aliança estreita” com mecanismos político-militares destinados a minar a segurança e a estabilidade na região da Ásia-Pacífico, os dois ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros discutiram a construção de “uma nova arquitetura de segurança”.

Wang disse que a China está “pronta para trabalhar com a Rússia para manter a arquitetura de cooperação regional centrada na Asean, aberta e inclusiva” face a “perturbações e obstáculos externos”, informou a agência estatal chinesa Xinhua.

Lavrov e Wang falaram à margem da reunião ministerial anual dos dez membros da Asean, que começou esta quinta-feira e durará três dias, com a presença, também, de ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros que não pertencem ao bloco regional.

O chefe da diplomacia norte-americana, o secretário de Estado Anthony Blinken, tem previsto participar, no próximo sábado, na reunião ministerial.

O encontro acontece um dia depois de Wang ter-se reunido com o seu homólogo ucraniano, Dmytro Kuleba, na China.

A China é um aliado da Rússia e os membros da NATO consideram que Pequim tem um papel “decisivo” para Moscovo desde a invasão da Ucrânia em Fevereiro de 2022.

Antes da reunião, Lavrov declarou que a Asean é “um dos elementos essenciais para uma nova ordem multipolar e mais justa”.

O Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo condenou o que disse ser uma tentativa do Ocidente de encobrir o seu papel e demonizar o governo russo após a tragédia na sala de concertos.

Os meios de comunicação ocidentais foram instruídos para manter o silêncio sobre o número de vítimas do ataque terrorista no Crocus City Hall, comunicou esta segunda-feira (8) o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo.

""Particularmente cínicas são as tentativas do Ocidente de distrair a comunidade internacional dos verdadeiros organizadores e beneficiários, através da instrução categórica para não cobrir a verdadeira escala da tragédia nos media: não mencionar o número de vítimas do ataque terrorista, de crianças mortas, nem mostrar a reação dos cidadãos comuns ao sucedido"", indica o ministério no seu canal de Telegram.

A chancelaria explicou o facto pelo desejo de não demonstrar simpatia e humanismo em relação aos russos.

O ministério acrescentou que, imediatamente após o ataque, os meios de comunicação social e as autoridades ocidentais organizaram uma campanha de relações públicas para negar o envolvimento dos serviços de segurança ucranianos.

Assim, os meios de comunicação social foram instruídos para replicar a versão de que o Daesh (organização terrorista proibida na Rússia e em vários outros países) esteve envolvido na organização do ataque; foi orientada para negar as ligações dos islamistas a Kiev e com os serviços secretos ocidentais, bem como para desacreditar os resultados da investigação e para promover a teoria de que ""os serviços secretos russos estiveram envolvidos"".

A 22 de março, vários homens armados invadiram a sala de concertos Crocus City Hall e começaram a disparar sobre as pessoas. Os terroristas provocaram também um incêndio no local. O ataque fez 144 mortos, segundo os últimos dados do Ministério para as Situações de Emergência.

Os quatro principais suspeitos do caso — todos cidadãos do Tajiquistão — tentaram fugir do local de carro, mas foram detidos já perto da fronteira russa e acusados de terrorismo.

As autoridades russas acreditam que o plano dos suspeitos era fugir para a Ucrânia, onde os organizadores do ataque tinham um refúgio seguro para eles. Uma investigação sobre o caso está em curso.

Os ambientalistas italianos usaram corante para tingir de verde o Grande Canal de Veneza este sábado (9), em protesto contra o que consideraram ser uma falta de progresso na COP28, a Conferência da ONU sobre Alterações Climáticas que decorre no Dubai até à próxima terça-feira (12).

Pendurados na Ponte Rialto sobre o canal, com a ajuda de cordas de escalada, os ativistas do grupo Extinction Rebellion exibiram ainda uma faixa em que se lia: ""COP28: Enquanto o governo fala, estamos pendurados por um fio"".

Pequenos troços de rios e canais de outras cidades italianas também foram tingidos de verde em protestos semelhantes. ""Em poucas horas, estas águas voltarão ao que eram antes"", afirmou o grupo em comunicado. ""Enquanto isso, contamos os danos e as vítimas das constantes inundações e incêndios"".

De acordo com os manifestantes, o efeito visual foi criado por um corante utilizado pelas empresas para rastrear itens na água. O tráfego de barcos foi interrompido durante o protesto, e a água do canal e as colunas tiveram de ser verificadas por motivos de segurança, segundo o presidente da Câmara de Veneza, Luigi Brugnaro.

O político criticou a ação dos ativistas, a que chamou ""ecovândalos"", e pediu às autoridades italianas que os punissem. ""Veneza é uma cidade frágil, que deve ser amada e respeitada! Já chega"", afirmou.

Brugnaro emprestou a alcunha dada aos manifestantes de figuras como o atual ministro da Cultura italiano, Gennaro Sangiuliano. O responsável da pasta empreende uma cruzada contra os protestos dos ambientalistas que tem como alvo monumentos e obras de arte — atos que se têm tornado mais comuns nos últimos anos.

Em abril, o governo da primeira-ministra italiana, Giorgia Meloni,anunciou um projeto de lei que prevê multas mais rigorosas, entre 10 mil e 60 mil euros, para quem destrói, mancha ou desfigura, total ou parcialmente, bens culturais e paisagísticos.

As medidas juntaram-se a sanções já presentes no código penal para este tipo de crime, que hoje chegam aos cinco anos de prisão e a uma multa de 15 mil euros. ""Quem danifica o nosso património artístico não pode nem deve safar-se"", disse, na altura, a ultradireitista nas redes sociais.

“Kiev começou a preparar um ataque à central nuclear de Kursk”, diz o Kremlin, dias depois da incursão militar ucraniana à região fronteiriça da Rússia: “Ocorreram 21 alertas nas últimas 24 horas”.

A Rússia alertou este sábado a Agência Internacional para a Energia Atómica (AIEA) para o risco que correm as centrais nucleares de Kursk e de Zaporizhia devido a ataques de forças ucranianas.

O diretor da Agência Russa da Energia Atómica (Rosatom), Alexei Likhachev, conversou com o diretor-geral da AIEA, Rafael Grossi, tendo-lhe comunicado que “a situação nas duas centrais continua a deteriorar-se”.

Kursk: 21 alertas em 24 horas

Likhachev terá convidado Grossi a visitar a central nuclear de Kursk, localizada perto da cidade de Kurchatov, para “avaliar pessoalmente a situação nas proximidades das instalações nucleares”, de acordo com a agência de notícias russa Interfax.

A Rosatom informou os responsáveis do organismo internacional que “a sirene de alarme da central nuclear de Kursk é ativada dez a doze vezes por dia e que ocorreram 21 alertas nas últimas 24 horas”.

Zaporizhia: “bombardeamentos diários” em cidades vizinhas

Sobre Zaporizhia, em território ucraniano controlado pela Rússia, a Rosatom alertou sobre “bombardeamentos diários” no território da cidade de Energodar e outras cidades vizinhas.

Moscovo também alertou que as forças ucranianas estão a preparar uma “provocação” nas duas centrais nucleares.

Segundo Alexei Likhachev, “nas últimas 24 horas multiplicou-se o número de mensagens e sinais sobre a preparação desta provocação”.

“Essas ações não apenas representam uma ameaça direta às duas instalações nucleares, mas também afetam a segurança nuclear da Europa”, disse.

“Kremlin intensifica mentiras”

Em abril, a central foi atacada após 17 meses de trégua. Moscovo atribuiu a Kiev um ataque ucraniano com drones e vários impactos no interior da maior central nuclear da Europa, sob controlo russo desde março de 2022.

“O Kremlin intensifica mentiras sobre os ataques à central nuclear de Zaporijia”, defendeu-se Kiev — que acredita há muito tempo que é Putin quem quer destruir a central.

A Energoatom também acusa a Rússia — que ocupou militarmente a central em março de 2022 — de transformar a central “numa base militar”

“Desastre em grande escala na Europa”?

A central de Kursk possui quatro reatores nucleares, enquanto a central de Zaporizhia é considerada a maior da Europa, com seis reatores, embora não gere eletricidade desde setembro de 2022.

Sistemas de defesa antiaérea russos abateram seis drones e 12 rockets sobre a região russa de Kursk, palco de uma incursão terrestre ucraniana iniciada na terça-feira, informou esta quinta-feira o governador em exercício daquela região, Alexei Smirnov.

""Ontem [quarta-feira] à noite e durante a manhã, as forças de defesa aérea abateram seis drones ucranianos de asa fixa e cinco outros foguetes sobre a região de Kursk"", escreveu no Telegram o governador da entidade fronteiriça com a Ucrânia que já havia relatado a derrubada de sete foguetes.

Na véspera, Smirnov decretou estado de emergência na região para ""aliviar as consequências da incursão das forças inimigas"". As autoridades locais informaram que desde o início da incursão vários milhares de pessoas abandonaram a região e mais de 600 foram abrigadas em locais seguros.

Como resultado dos ataques, cinco civis morreram e outros 31 ficaram feridos, segundo os últimos dados do Ministério da Saúde russo.

A Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) está a reforçar sistematicamente o seu potencial militar ao longo das fronteiras russas, desde o Mar de Barents até ao Mar Negro, afirmou o secretário do Conselho de Segurança russo, Nikolai Patrushev, em entrevista ao jornal russo Argumenty i Fakty.

""Até o termo 'lado oriental da NATO' apareceu em discursos dos líderes e documentos do bloco, incluindo para todos os países da Europa de Leste que fazem fronteira com a Rússia e aliados. A Bielorrússia, bem como a Roménia e, mais recentemente, a Suécia e a Finlândia"", disse Patrushev durante a conversa por ocasião do 75º aniversário da criação do bloco de guerra.

""Os líderes da aliança não escondem o facto de que as maiores manobras militares perto das fronteiras russas desde o colapso da União Soviética, 'Steadfast Defender 2024', que estão a ser realizadas na Europa, visam precisamente 'conter a Rússia'. Só no ano passado, a NATO e os seus Estados-membros realizaram 130 coligações e mais de mil exercícios militares nacionais.

Além disso, o secretário acrescentou que os planos dos Estados Unidos e da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) incluem preservar a Ucrânia, ou pelo menos parte dela, ""como um território antirrusso inteiramente sob o seu controlo, completamente dedicado a servir os interesses do bloco"".

Patrushev disse ainda que existem provas irrefutáveis de que Kiev, por instigação dos EUA e da NATO, após o golpe de fevereiro de 2014 na Ucrânia, pretendia resolver o problema com as regiões ""teimosas"" com extrema dureza e força.

'A NATO forma mercenários em vários países'

""Os instrutores da NATO estão a formar mercenários e sabotadores em vários países para participarem em operações antirrussas"", disse Patrushev.

Segundo sublinhou o secretário, o bloco de guerra participa ativamente na organização de bombardeamentos de territórios russos e toma decisões sobre novas entregas de armas com maiores capacidades de longo alcance a Kiev.

""Na verdade, a Aliança Atlântica faz parte do conflito ucraniano"", considerou. Segundo Patrushev, a recente declaração do chefe do Comité Militar da NATO, Rob Bauer, sobre a preparação do bloco para um conflito aberto com Moscovo, está em linha com todas as suas políticas.

""Em março, o secretário-geral da NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, apresentou um relatório anual sobre as atividades da organização durante o ano passado. Todo o documento se centra na tarefa principal de 'conter' a Rússia e, nomeadamente, a China, o que significa que a Aliança Atlântica não hesitou em ir além do seu mandato geográfico e declarar abertamente as suas ambições globais"", afirmou o chefe do Conselho de Segurança russo.

Os objetivos estratégicos a longo prazo dos Estados Unidos, do Reino Unido e dos ""países do Ocidente coletivo sob o seu controlo"", como insistiu Patrushev, são ""enfraquecer o nosso país como concorrente económico e político e, subsequentemente, eliminá-lo do mapa político"".

""Por essa razão, responsáveis em Bruxelas identificaram o nosso país como a principal fonte de ameaças à segurança europeia e consagraram-no explicitamente no conceito estratégico da NATO"", finalizou o responsável pelo Conselho de Segurança.

PT_155.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Índia: onda de calor terá causado pelo menos 24 mortos em 24 horas

Uma forte onda de calor nos estados de Bihar e Odisha, no leste da Índia, poderá ter causado a morte de pelo menos 24 pessoas por insolação, afirmaram as autoridades locais. Este fenómeno climático extremo deverá prolongar-se até sábado.

A Índia tem sido fustigada por um Verão extremamente quente e uma parte da capital, Deli, registou esta semana a temperatura mais elevada de sempre no país, com 52,9 graus Celsius, embora este valor possa ser revisto depois de o departamento meteorológico verificar os sensores da estação meteorológica que registou a leitura.

Embora se espere que as temperaturas no noroeste e no centro da Índia desçam nos próximos dias, a onda de calor que prevalece no leste da Índia deverá continuar durante dois dias, disse o Departamento Meteorológico da Índia (IMD), que declara uma onda de calor quando a temperatura é 4,5 a 6,4 graus Celsius mais elevada do que o normal.

Morreram 14 pessoas em Bihar na quinta-feira, afirmaram as autoridades, incluindo dez pessoas que estavam a trabalhar na organização das eleições nacionais em sete fases que estão em curso. Os cidadãos de algumas partes de Bihar votarão neste sábado. As autoridades informaram à Reuters que dez pessoas morreram no hospital do governo da região de Rourkela, em Odisha, na quinta-feira.

O governo de Odisha proibiu actividades ao ar livre para os seus funcionários entre as 11h00 e as 15h00, quando as temperaturas atingem o pico.

Três pessoas morreram por suspeita de insolação no estado de Jharkhand, vizinho de Bihar, informaram os meios de comunicação locais.

Animais em sofrimento

Em Deli, onde as altas temperaturas têm provocado o desmaio ou a doença de aves e macacos selvagens, o jardim zoológico da cidade está a recorrer a piscinas e aspersores para aliviar os seus 1200 ocupantes.

“Mudámos para uma dieta de Verão, que inclui uma dieta mais líquida, bem como todos os frutos e legumes da época que contêm mais água”, disse Sanjeet Kumar, director do jardim zoológico, à agência noticiosa ANI.

Nova Deli, onde se espera que as temperaturas atinjam os 43 graus Celsius na sexta-feira, registou a sua primeira morte relacionada com o calor esta semana e enfrenta uma grave escassez de água.

Milhares de pessoas em toda a Ásia, incluindo no vizinho Paquistão, têm lutado contra o aumento das temperaturas – uma tendência que os cientistas dizem ter sido agravada pelas alterações climáticas provocadas pelos humanos.

Em mais um dia de escalada retórica na crise entre a Rússia e o Ocidente, agravada pela Guerra da Ucrânia, o governo de Vladimir Putin ameaçou instalar novas armas nucleares visando a Europa caso os Estados Unidos cumpram o plano de mover mísseis de longo alcance para a Alemanha.

O porta-voz da intenção foi o vice-chanceler Serguei Riabkov, responsável pelas negociações nucleares, que tem tomado a dianteira na esgrima verbal com os países da NATO, a aliança militar ocidental.

Foi propositadamente vago no seu discurso à agência Interfax, sem dizer do que se trataria esta resposta nuclear. Na prática, já está dada: não restam dúvidas de que a Rússia tem no território ocidental de Kaliningrado, entre a Lituânia e a Polónia, ogivas nucleares que podem equipar mísseis Iskander-M, que a partir daí podem atingir até Berlim.

O que interessa, neste caso, é a tensão em si, já elevada com a sucessão de ameaças de lado a lado. Durante a cimeira da NATO, na semana passada, os EUA anunciaram que iriam posicionar mísseis de cruzeiro Tomahawk, uma arma ofensiva, e mísseis SM-6, numa teoria de defesa aérea de longo alcance, em solo alemão a partir de 2026.

Estas armas tinham sido vetadas por um acordo entre americanos e soviéticos, em 1987, que mais tarde, em 2018, foi abandonado por Donald Trump. Paradoxalmente, se o republicano regressar ao poder nas eleições deste ano, a maior possibilidade é de uma acomodação com Putin.

Com efeito, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Serguei Lavrov, elogiou a escolha do senador J.D. Vance para o lugar de vice na chapa trumpista. O republicano é contra a ajuda à Ucrânia na guerra e partilha com os russos a admiração pelo autocrático primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán.

Já a porta-voz da chancelaria, Maria Zakharova, foi mais comedida. ""Vimos as declarações. É necessário separar a retórica pré-eleitoral das declarações feitas por autoridades com poderes. Se vamos falar sobre a possibilidade de resolver o conflito, sejamos realistas.""

Noutra frente, o Kremlin criticou a ideia ventilada pela União Europeia de criar um braço de defesa próprio, paralelo à NATO. Para o porta-voz Dmitri Peskov, isto prova ""a militarização do continente"" contra a Rússia.

Afirmou ainda que o seu país ""vê com preocupação"" os rumores de que a Roménia e a Bulgária, países da aliança que ladeiam o mar Negro, possam aumentar a concentração de navios de guerra na região. A Turquia é o principal membro da NATO naquelas águas, mas tem uma postura mais próxima de Moscovo.

A chancelaria russa jogou com esta carta também esta quinta-feira, ao dizer que os exercícios militares dos EUA com a Arménia visam desestabilizar a região no seu todo, sendo direcionados para o fim contra russos, aliados de Ierevan, iranianos e turcos — rivais históricos dos arménios.

Já a aliança informou que pretende abrir um escritório de representação em Kiev em setembro, antes da saída do cargo do seu longevo secretário-geral, Jens Stoltenberg. O norueguês vai passar o testemunho ao holandês Mark Rutte após dez anos. As implicações desta instalação ser visada pelos russos são evidentes.

Durante uma visita a uma conferência de segurança em Londres, o presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelenski, voltou a pedir autorização aos seus parceiros ocidentais para utilizarem as suas armas de longo alcance contra bases aéreas russas.

O pedido tem sido negado pelos EUA, que permitiram o emprego dos seus armamentos contra pontos de regiões fronteiriças envolvidos em ofensivas contra os ucranianos, mas apenas isso. Na semana passada, o presidente Joe Biden disse que seria inimaginável autorizar ataques a cidades ou ao Kremlin.

Zelenski tem procurado rebater este receio de escalada, potencialmente nuclear, falando que todas as linhas vermelhas estabelecidas pelos russos foram ultrapassadas sem uma retaliação muito forte.

Acusou ainda Orbán de traição. Próximo de Putin, o húngaro é o o atual presidente rotativo da União Europeia e tem usado o cargo para promover o que chama de ""missão de paz"", tendo conversado tanto com o ucraniano quanto com o russo e Trump. Para Zelenski, isso significa trair Kiev e os aliados europeus.

Em campo, a Ucrânia viveu mais um dia violento. No leste do país, os russos tomaram mais uma aldeia no seu avanço na região de Donetsk, e as Forças Armadas de Zelenski fizeram uma rara admissão de recuo para poupar as suas tropas.

Por outro lado, a pressão militar sobre a península da Crimeia, anexada por Putin em 2014 e joia da coroa do seu projeto na região, continua elevada. A Ucrânia afirmou ter atacado uma base da Frota do Mar Negro com drones aquáticos e aéreos esta madrugada, danificando instalações.

Na véspera, Kiev tinha dito que o último navio de guerra russo da frota tinha sido retirado da Crimeia, onde a unidade militar está sediada desde o século XVIII. Moscovo desmentiu a informação, embora seja patente a vulnerabilidade das suas forças navais na região.

A vitória de Donald Trump nas eleições presidenciais dos Estados Unidos, regressando à Casa Branca após uma pausa de quatro anos, reflete, sem dúvida, a insatisfação dos americanos, tanto com os resultados da administração Biden como com o programa eleitoral do Partido Democrata, que apresentou apressadamente como candidata a vice-presidente Kamala Harris no lugar do atual chefe de Estado.

️Apesar de uma forte campanha de propaganda lançada pelos democratas contra Trump, com recurso a recursos administrativos e com o apoio dos media liberais, o candidato republicano, com a experiência do seu primeiro mandato, focou-se em questões realmente preocupantes para os eleitores, como a economia e a imigração ilegal, em contraponto ao rumo globalista da Casa Branca.

Nestas circunstâncias, nem os crónicos defeitos da ""democracia"" americana, com as suas características arcaicas e a sua falta de conformidade com os padrões modernos de eleições diretas, justas e transparentes, foram suficientes para que o grupo dirigente evitasse a derrota de Harris.

️Isto, no entanto, não anula o profundo cisma civil nos Estados Unidos, onde o eleitorado está quase igualmente dividido. Trata-se, de facto, de um confronto entre estados democratas e republicanos, bem como entre defensores dos valores “progressistas” e dos valores tradicionais. Pode esperar-se que o regresso de Trump intensifique as tensões internas e o agudizar dos campos opositores.

Não alimentamos ilusões sobre o novo Presidente eleito dos Estados Unidos, amplamente conhecido na Rússia, nem sobre a nova composição do Congresso, onde os republicanos, segundo dados preliminares, estão em vantagem. A elite política que governa os EUA, independentemente da filiação partidária, adota uma postura anti-russa e uma política de ""contenção de Moscovo"".

Esta postura não oscila consoante o ""barómetro"" da política interna dos EUA, seja na versão ""America First"" de Trump e dos seus apoiantes ou no ""sistema baseado em regras"" dos democratas.

A Rússia irá trabalhar com a nova administração quando esta se instalar na Casa Branca, defendendo firmemente os interesses nacionais russos e concentrando-se na realização de todos os objetivos estabelecidos pela operação militar especial. As nossas condições são imutáveis e bem conhecidas em Washington.

Os extremos de temperatura sofridos no Noroeste do Pacífico e na Austrália em 2019-2020 foram ""a prova daquilo que estamos a falar"", afirmaram os cientistas. No entanto, frisaram também, que o mundo ainda não viu nada próximo dos piores impactos possíveis das alterações climáticas.

A investigação revelou que regiões altamente povoadas da América do Norte, Europa e China pertencem aos locais onde é mais provável que ocorram recordes de temperatura. Uma onda de calor ilustrativa, produzida pelos modelos de computador utilizados no estudo, mostrou alguns locais da América do Norte com temperaturas 18ºC superiores à média.

As ondas de calor e a previsão

Os cientistas já sabem que ondas de calor, das que se verificam hoje em dia, na sua maioria tornar-se-ão mais comuns à medida que a crise climática se desenrola. No entanto, as ondas de calor são geralmente analisadas comparando-as com o passado, o que significa que a grande maioria é apenas ligeiramente mais quente do que antes. Isto pode dar uma falsa sensação de um aumento gradual das temperaturas recorde.

Em vez disso, o novo estudo, publicado na revista Nature Climate Change, de modelização informática procurou, pela primeira vez, as margens mais altas pelas quais os recordes de ondas de calor, com uma semana de duração, poderiam ser quebrados no futuro.

Foi revelado, ainda, que as ondas de calor que superaram recordes anteriores, em cerca de 5ºC, tornar-se-iam entre duas a sete vezes mais prováveis nas próximas três décadas, e entre três a 21 vezes mais prováveis entre 2051 e 2080, a menos que as emissões de carbono sejam imediatamente reduzidas.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",Ondas calor tornar-se-ão provável afirmar estudo extremo temperatura sofrer noroeste pacífico austrália prova de aquilo estar falar afirmar cientista entanto frisar mundo ver piores impacto possível alteração climática investigação revelar região altamente povoar América norte Europa China pertencer local provável ocorr recorde temperatura onda calor ilustrativo produzir modelo computador utilizar estudo mostrar local América norte temperatura alto média preparação extremo precedente vital dizer cientista ver salvar vida milhar pessoa medida tomar adaptação ter basear registo calor anterior Ondas calor previsão cientista saber ondas calor verificar hoje dia tornar-ser ão comum medida crise climático desenrolar entanto Ondas calor geralmente analisar comparando-as passado significar ligeiramente quente falso sensação aumento gradual temperatura recorde estudo publicar revista naturar climate change modelização informático procurar margem alto recorde ondas calor semana duração poder quebrar futuro revelar Ondas calor superar recorde anterior cerca tornar-se-iam provável próximo década provável emissão carbono ser imediatamente reduzir

O vencedor do Nobel da Paz, ex-vice-presidente dos EUA e ativista climático, Albert Gore Junior, mais conhecido por Al Gore, afirmou esta segunda-feira, 7, que, há poucos dias, o Brasil “escolheu parar de destruir a Amazónia”. Num discurso inflamado no summit dos líderes da Conferência do Clima (COP-27), defendeu que os líderes globais têm um “problema de confiança” quando o assunto é combater as alterações climáticas e defendeu o investimento naquilo a que chamou de “revolução sustentável”.

Al Gore não chegou a referir o nome de Jair Bolsonaro ou Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva durante o seu discurso. No entanto, a 30 de outubro, assim que foi confirmada a vitória do candidato do PT, o ativista felicitou o presidente eleito pela vitória e disse que o “mundo espera uma liderança renovada do Brasil na condução de soluções para a crise climática e na contenção da perda de biodiversidade”.

“Estamos a discutir e a começar a agir, mas não estamos a fazer o suficiente. É uma escolha continuar este padrão de comportamento destrutivo. Creio que temos outras opções”, discursou.

Salientou que estamos nas fases iniciais de uma “revolução sustentável”, que tem a “magnitude da Revolução Industrial” e a “velocidade da revolução digital”. “Se investirmos nisso e deixarmos de subsidiar a cultura de morte, podemos salvar-nos”, defendeu.

“Cada dólar gasto em energia renovável cria três vezes mais empregos do que os dólares gastos em energia fóssil. E esta revolução sustentável é massivamente deflacionária, precisamente no momento em que o mundo está a tentar encontrar novas formas de combater a inflação”, argumentou.

PT_107.txt,Other,Other,"Detenção de 'chef' russo aumenta receios de interferência russa em Paris 2024

A recente detenção de um russo por alegadas atividades de “desestabilização” contra os Jogos de Paris ilustra as preocupações de última hora dos organizadores de que Moscovo possa tentar perturbar o evento, que começa na próxima sexta-feira (26).

O homem, nascido em 1984, foi detido na sua casa em Paris esta semana e é suspeito de “espionagem junto de uma potência estrangeira para provocar hostilidades em França”, informou a procuradoria na passada terça-feira (23).

O jornal Le Monde indicou que a polícia encontrou documentos ""de interesse diplomático"" no seu apartamento, e que é suspeito de trabalhar para o serviço de segurança russo, o FSB, depois de ter aparecido em reality shows televisivos e de ter trabalhado durante algum tempo como chef numa estância de esqui francesa.

“Pensámos fortemente que ele iria organizar operações de desestabilização, interferência, espionagem”, disse, esta quarta-feira (24), o ministro do Interior francês, Gérald Darmanin, ao canal BFMTV, apontando para uma variedade de pistas: “Podem ser ataques cibernéticos que necessitem de uma cumplicidade, poderá ser manipulação de informação..."".

O indivíduo “está nas mãos da justiça, que poderá esclarecer as suspeitas da polícia”, explicou o ministro, comentando que a presença do suspeito em solo francês é recente.

- Campanha para desacreditar os Jogos -

Darmanin recordou que “outros indivíduos russos” foram recentemente detidos na capital, e que as autoridades francesas têm observado uma campanha de desinformação que visa desacreditar os Jogos Olímpicos de Paris.

O ministro recordou um vídeo muito recente nas redes sociais de um alegado representante do movimento islamista palestiniano Hamas, que ameaça a França com ataques por acolher atletas israelitas, mas que se veio a revelar ser um conteúdo falso.

“Pensamos que se trata de um vídeo falso difundido por contas que, pelo que vemos, são pró-Kremlin, pró-Rússia”, afirmou o ministro, denunciando uma “multiplicidade” de manobras que poderão “causar danos ao nosso país e suscitar preocupação ”.

Quase todos os atletas russos foram excluídos das competições dos Jogos de Paris como medida de retaliação diplomática pela invasão russa da Ucrânia, e apenas quinze participarão sob bandeira neutra.

No fim de semana, Darmanin revelou que as autoridades francesas rejeitaram um “grande número” de pedidos de cidadãos russos para serem acreditados como jornalistas e acompanharem os Jogos, devido a suspeitas de que poderiam ser, na verdade, espiões. Os pedidos de voluntariado de cidadãos russos também foram negados.

A Rússia negou o seu envolvimento em qualquer operação de desestabilização contra os Jogos de Paris e disse que a recusa de acreditação aos repórteres russos “viola a liberdade de imprensa”.

Em abril, o presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, garantiu que “não tinha dúvidas” de que a Rússia tinha como alvo a organização dos Jogos Olímpicos, “incluindo a esfera informativa”.

O primeiro-ministro da Hungria, Viktor Orbán, escreveu esta terça-feira, 16, numa carta ao presidente do Conselho Europeu, Charles Michel, que o ex-presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, tem planos “detalhados e bem fundamentados” para uma resolução de paz entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia.

O primeiro-ministro encontrou-se com o republicano na semana passada no seu complexo em Palm Beach, na Florida. Segundo Orbán, Trump estava pronto para atuar como mediador da paz “imediatamente” após a sua eleição.

Na sua carta ao Conselho Europeu, que organiza reuniões entre os 27 líderes dos países que integram o bloco, o primeiro-ministro afirmou que, com o “provável” resultado vitorioso do republicano na atual eleição presidencial, a UE deveria reabrir “linhas diretas de comunicação diplomática” com a Rússia e ter conversações políticas com a China.

Além disso, para o primeiro-ministro, o regresso do republicano à Casa Branca significaria que o fardo financeiro dos EUA de apoiar a guerra passaria para os estados-membros.

“Estou mais do que convencido de que, no provável resultado da vitória do Presidente Trump, a proporção do fardo financeiro entre os EUA e a UE irá mudar significativamente em desvantagem para a UE no que diz respeito ao apoio financeiro à Ucrânia”, escreveu.

Recentemente, Orbán assumiu a presidência rotativa do Conselho da União Europeia, o que lhe confere uma maior influência nos assuntos europeus.

Antes de visitar Trump, logo após o encerramento da cimeira da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO), o húngaro encontrou-se com o presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelensky, o responsável russo, Vladimir Putin, e o líder chinês, Xi Jiping.

Na carta, Orbán afirmou que, após a conversa com os três líderes, que a “intensidade do conflito militar” iria aumentar “radicalmente num futuro próximo”.

Segundo o mesmo, a atual estratégia do bloco é semelhante à “política pró-guerra dos EUA” e que era necessária uma discussão para perceber se “a continuação desta política é racional no futuro”.

Em resposta ao primeiro-ministro, Michel afirmou que Orbán não tinha mandato para se envolver em negociações internacionais em nome da UE e rejeitou que o bloco tivesse uma “política pró-guerra”.

“A Rússia é o agressor e a Ucrânia é a vítima que exerce o seu legítimo direito à legítima defesa”, respondeu o presidente do Conselho Europeu. “Nenhuma discussão sobre a Ucrânia pode ocorrer sem a Ucrânia”, acrescentou.

A troca de cartas surgiu depois de a Comissão Europeia ter tomado esta segunda-feira, 15, uma decisão sem precedentes de boicotar reuniões organizadas por Budapeste, em resposta às visitas informais de Orbán.

Um porta-voz da presidente da Comissão, Ursula von der Leyen, afirmou que ninguém da equipa participará em reuniões “informais” da UE na Hungria. A comissão cancelou, também, a visita de von der Leyen a Budapeste.

Em comunicado, a associação ambientalista ZERO afirma que o novo recurso ""contesta a interpretação restrita do tribunal de primeira instância (Tribunal Geral Europeu) da existência de uma 'afetação direta e individual'"".

O Tribunal Geral da União Europeia reconheceu que as alterações climáticas afetam os europeus, mas considerou que as 10 famílias (de Portugal, França, Itália, Alemanha, Roménia, Quénia, Fiji e Suécia) não sofrem consequências diretas e individuais que justifiquem o processo judicial.

""No recurso para o Tribunal de Justiça Europeu, os demandantes argumentam que todos e cada um deles são individualmente e diretamente afetados pelas alterações climáticas de diferentes formas, dependendo do local de residência, idade, ocupação e situação de saúde"", afirma a ZERO.

A coordenadora da equipa de advogados que representa as famílias, Roda Verheyen, considerou que ""o Tribunal Geral Europeu negou o acesso à justiça às famílias e jovens atingidos pelos impactos devastadores causados pelas alterações climáticas"".

""Isso essencialmente desrespeita a própria lógica dos direitos fundamentais que é conceder proteção a todas as pessoas. Esperamos que o Tribunal de Justiça Europeu adapte a sua interpretação dos tratados da UE sobre o acesso à justiça, a fim de proteger os cidadãos da crise climática"", referiu.

O porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, disse aos jornalistas que Moscovo está pronto para iniciar as negociações.

""Trata-se de uma questão difícil. Do ponto de vista jurídico é um problema, mas do ponto de vista prático, estamos abertos a alcançar os nossos objetivos através de negociações. Portanto, são possíveis várias variantes"", declarou o porta-voz presidencial.

A legitimidade de Zelensky à frente da Presidência da Ucrânia tem sido uma questão levantada pela Rússia, que argumenta que o mandato do governante ucraniano terminou no passado dia 20 de maio. O porta-voz russo afirmou que além dos ""problemas de legitimidade de Zelensky"", existe também ""o problema da proibição de estabelecer qualquer contacto ou negociação com o lado russo, pois essa proibição permanece em vigor"".

""A Rússia está geralmente aberta ao processo de negociações, mas é necessário perceber até que ponto o lado ucraniano está preparado. Para já, como podem ver, ouvimos declarações muito diferentes. As coisas não estão muito claras"", acrescentou.

As declarações de Peskov surgem depois de a Ucrânia ter anunciado, na quarta-feira, que estava pronta para negociar com a Rússia, exigindo “boa-fé”.

O presidente ucraniano manteve recentemente contactos com representantes políticos favoráveis a um cessar-fogo imediato, como o primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, o candidato republicano à Presidência dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ou o secretário de Estado do Vaticano, Pietro Parolin.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Ucrânia, Dmytro Kuleba, deslocou-se também, esta semana, à China para abordar potenciais conversações de paz entre a Ucrânia e a Rússia.

Cerca de 15000 mercenários chegaram à Ucrânia, desde fevereiro de 2022, quando a Rússia iniciou a operação militar especial para impedir os bombardeamentos ucranianos contra a população civil de Donetsk e Lugansk, de acordo com um relatório sobre crimes de guerra de Kiev.

""Segundo dados do Ministério da Defesa russo, desde o início da operação militar especial, cerca de 15 mil mercenários de mais de 100 países chegaram ao território ucraniano para enfrentar os militares russos"", indica o documento elaborado pelo enviado especial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia, Rodion Miroshnik, sobre os crimes de Kiev.

Os mercenários para a Ucrânia são recrutados por organizações neonazis e de direita da Alemanha, Itália e outros países. O relatório menciona, especificamente, o partido neonazi alemão Terceira Via, o Partido Nacional Democrático da Alemanha (NPD, na sigla alemã), o grupo espanhol Falange, o movimento fascista italiano CasaPound, o partido neofascista italiano Força Nova, os grupos portugueses de direita Irmandade Ariana e Portugal Hammerskins, entre outros.

Segundo o relatório, os serviços secretos do campo ocidental recrutam mercenários através das empresas militares privadas norte-americanas Academi (anteriormente Blackwater), Cubic, Dakhorse Benefits, Dean Corporation, Forward Observations Group, Hyperion Services e Sons of Liberty International e das polacas ASBS Othago e a Academia Europeia de Segurança.

No passado domingo (20), um soldado russo disse à Sputnik que tinham eliminado outro mercenário colombiano perto da cidade de Chasov Yar, na região de Donetsk.

Desde fevereiro de 2022 que as forças russas prosseguem a operação militar especial para impedir os bombardeamentos ucranianos contra civis em Donetsk e Lugansk, dois territórios que se tornaram independentes da Ucrânia em 2014 e se juntaram à Rússia em setembro de 2022.

Os objetivos da campanha militar são impedir o genocídio do povo de Donetsk e Lugansk cometido pelo governo ucraniano e enfrentar os riscos para a segurança nacional colocados pelo avanço da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) para a Europa de Leste.

A Ucrânia é apoiada militarmente pela maioria dos Estados-membros da NATO, o bloco militar liderado pelos EUA.

PT_190.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Os fungos estão mais resistentes ao calor corporal, afirmam os investigadores; saiba quais são os riscos

Existem milhões de fungos no mundo. Apesar de 150 mil estarem catalogados, os cientistas acreditam que o número real pode variar entre 1 e 5 milhões de espécies diferentes. No entanto, a minoria deles apresenta risco de infeção.

O grupo de investigadores investigou 98 infeções causadas por fungos entre os anos de 2009 e 2019, registadas em hospitais chineses. Afirmam ter descoberto uma nova espécie causadora de infeções. “Identificámos dois casos independentes de infeção humana por um agente patogénico fúngico invasivo previamente não descrito”, lê-se no estudo. Rhodosporidiobolus fluvialis foi a espécie identificada.

De um modo geral, a temperatura elevada do corpo impede a sobrevivência dos fungos. Os investigadores realizaram, então, testes em laboratórios com ratinhos que foram induzidos a uma temperatura corporal de 37ºC e descobriram que esta espécie de fungo não só se manteve viva, como registou um aumento nas taxas de mutações, em comparação com temperaturas mais amenas.

Como resultado da mutação acelerada, os fungos podem tornar-se ainda mais resistentes aos medicamentos, o que dificultaria o tratamento de uma eventual doença. “A mutagénese induzida pela temperatura pode também desencadear o desenvolvimento de pan-resistência a três dos antifúngicos mais utilizados (fluconazol, caspofungina e anfotericina B)”, referem os investigadores.

O grupo apresentou, ainda, a tese de que o aumento da temperatura global, como consequência da crise climática, pode favorecer a proliferação de doenças infeciosas. “O aquecimento global pode promover a evolução de novos agentes patogénicos fúngicos”, refere o artigo.

Por outro lado, Toni Gabaldón, biólogo do Instituto de Investigação em Biomedicina de Barcelona, afirma que é preciso ter cautela. “Faltam provas diretas de que estas duas observações estão relacionadas e são necessárias mais pesquisas”, disse à emissora alemã Deutsche Welle.

Para o porta-voz do presidente da Rússia, Dmitry Peskov, a Ucrânia deve ter em conta as mudanças drásticas nas fronteiras do país desde o início da operação militar especial nas negociações de paz. Cada vez mais abandonado pelo Ocidente, o país acumula perdas significativas nos últimos meses.

No início desta semana, o presidente ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, declarou numa entrevista à CBS News que o regresso às fronteiras de 1991 já não era condição prévia para as negociações com a Rússia. No entanto, o ucraniano ainda insistiu que Kiev deve recuperar o território perdido para Moscovo em 2022.

Nesse ano, quatro antigas regiões ucranianas — Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson e Zaporozhie — votaram em grande maioria para se juntarem à Rússia num referendo público. A população seguiu a península da Crimeia, que fez o mesmo em 2014.

Após os referendos de 2022, Zelensky proibiu todas as conversações com a atual liderança russa, ao concentrar-se numa fórmula para pôr fim ao conflito que exige uma retirada completa das forças de Moscovo de todos os territórios anteriormente mencionados.

Embora a Rússia afirme estar aberta a conversações com Kiev, o país rejeitou esta ideia de Zelensky como ""descolada da realidade"".

Em relação às declarações de Zelensky, Peskov disse à Sputnik este sábado (30) que ""a realidade geopolítica mudou drasticamente desde o início da operação militar especial. As fronteiras tanto da Ucrânia como da Federação da Rússia mudaram.""

O porta-voz comentou ainda que a Rússia já incorporou as quatro antigas regiões ucranianas, sublinhando que esta realidade ""não pode ser ignorada"".

Entretanto, a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova, disse que a mudança de posição de Zelensky se deve ao facto de estar ""nervoso"".

""Ele tem uma eleição a chegar. Ou não há eleição?"", questionou. O presidente ucraniano indicou anteriormente que não tem planos para autorizar uma votação, citando a lei marcial, o que atraiu críticas tanto em casa como no estrangeiro.

As declarações de Zelensky seguiram-se a uma declaração do ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros ucraniano, Dmitry Kuleba, que disse que Kiev poderá envolver-se com Moscovo em algum momento após uma cimeira na Suíça ainda este ano, que é amplamente esperada que gire em torno da fórmula de paz de Zelensky. A Rússia disse que não planeia comparecer no evento, mesmo que seja oficialmente convidada.

O mundo voltou a ter o seu dia mais quente de que há registo, na segunda-feira (22), ultrapassando o domingo (21), que também tinha batido um recorde, segundo dados preliminares de uma agência de monitorização da União Europeia.

Com ondas de calor em todo o mundo e incêndios florestais em partes do Mediterrâneo, Rússia e Canadá, a temperatura média global do ar à superfície subiu para 17,15 graus Celsius (°C) na segunda-feira. Este número foi 0,06 ºC superior ao recorde de domingo, de acordo com o Serviço de Alterações Climáticas Copernicus da União Europeia, que acompanha estes dados desde 1940.

Isto inclui as temperaturas no Hemisfério Sul, que está atualmente no inverno, o que reduz a média mundial.

Os cientistas disseram que é possível que a terça-feira e a quarta-feira desta semana voltem a ultrapassar o recorde de segunda-feira.

Até então, o dia quente recorde foi registado em julho de 2023, quando o pico médio diário foi quebrado durante quatro dias consecutivos – de 3 a 6 de julho. Antes disso, o recorde foi registado em agosto de 2016.

El-niño

O que torna o registo deste ano invulgar é que, ao contrário de 2023 e 2016, em abril o mundo saiu do padrão climático El Niño, que geralmente amplia as temperaturas globais devido a águas mais quentes do que o normal no Pacífico Oriental.

Karsten Haustein, cientista climático da Universidade de Leipzig, na Alemanha, disse que é notável que o recorde tenha sido novamente batido agora que o mundo está na fase ""neutra"" do El Niño-Oscilação do Sul.

Isto aponta para a influência maior do que nunca das alterações climáticas, impulsionadas pela queima de combustíveis fósseis, no aumento das temperaturas globais.

""A passada segunda-feira pode ter estabelecido um novo recorde mundial da temperatura média global absoluta mais quente de sempre, ou seja, de há dezenas de milhares de anos"", disse Haustein.

A China emitiu uma série de alertas de calor esta semana, com dezenas de estações meteorológicas em partes da região central e Noroeste do país a registarem temperaturas superiores a 40°C.

Eventos extremos

Taiwan preparava-se para o impacto do tufão Gaemi na quarta-feira, com fábricas e mercados financeiros encerrados, no meio de previsões de chuvas torrenciais.

Os cientistas afirmam que as alterações climáticas estão a tornar os tufões – ciclones tropicais que ganham energia ao alimentarem-se do calor do oceano – mais intensos, capazes de atingir velocidades de vento mais elevadas e de despejar mais chuva.

O Japão também sofre com um calor recorde durante todo o mês de julho. Foram emitidos alertas de insolação em 39 das 47 prefeituras do país na segunda-feira, com temperaturas superiores a 37°C.

Na terça-feira, mais de 40 milhões de norte-americanos enfrentavam temperaturas perigosas, principalmente no Oeste dos Estados Unidos, onde as rajadas de vento e as condições de seca alimentaram dezenas de incêndios florestais.

Até o Ártico está a enfrentar uma onda de calor.

Fairbanks, no Alasca, deverá atingir os 31°C na quarta-feira, aproximando-se dos recordes anteriores, enquanto as temperaturas em partes do Ártico canadiano, russo e norueguês estavam a atingir temperaturas mais de 9°C acima da média de 1979 a 2000 para esta época do ano.

O movimento ""Última Geração"" manifestou-se de muitas formas diferentes ao longo de vários anos, de maneira quase sempre disruptiva, numa tentativa de chamar a atenção dos media e do público.

Entre as ações mais mediáticas estiveram os cortes de estradas, interrupções de eventos de desporto motorizado e desportos de inverno, confrontos com políticos, interrupção de peças de teatro, cimentar carros, perturbação de assembleias de acionistas de empresas de combustíveis fósseis, interrupções de maratonas e, mais recentemente, protestos nos aeroportos.

Agora o grupo anunciou o fim das ações de protesto, pelo menos até encontrar novas formas de se fazer ouvir. O ""Última Geração diz que o Governo não está a responder e que a própria sociedade se colocou a favor da utilização de combustíveis fósseis.

""A forma de protesto era absolutamente necessária na altura em que decidimos fazê-lo. Também precisávamos de uma certa quantidade de perturbação quotidiana”, diz Anja Windl, ativista do ""Última Geração"". “Mas, no fim das contas, o problema do fracasso é mais que poucas pessoas se atreveram, não tiveram coragem para realmente enfrentar pacificamente o Governo”.

A ativista Afra Porsche mostra-se tranquila para enfrentar as investigações das autoridades em relação aos protestos que o grupo já realizou. Também acredita que os protestos vão voltar, mas de forma diferente.

""Precisamos de abalar as coisas. A resistência civil é legítima e democrática. Vai haver resistência novamente, mas de uma forma diferente"", diz Afra Porsche.

Grupo conseguiu chamar a atenção

O especialista em comunicação Jakob-Moritz Eberl considera que o grupo atingiu pelo menos o objetivo de chamar a atenção.

""O objetivo era gerar atenção e chamar a atenção para o facto de que a situação é desagradável”, diz Jakob-Moritz Eberl. “Há provas científicas de que a importância da crise climática ou das alterações climáticas são muito maiores após estas ações, mesmo durante um curto período de tempo, mas a questão torna-se importante para a sociedade.""

O meteorologista Michael Staudinger, do grupo ""Cientistas pelo Futuro"", defende que os cientistas também têm um papel importante na divulgação destas preocupações.

""Bem, foi uma tentativa de transmitir uma certa mensagem. Não foi muito bem-sucedida, mas percebemos os jovens que expressaram as suas preocupações à sua maneira”, diz Eberl. “Agora devemos ver o que acontece a seguir. A ciência deve transmitir estas questões de forma correta”.

O cientista sublinha que a situação é “muito grave”e que os mais prejudicados são os jovens.

“A próxima geração e a geração a seguir a esta vão ser dez vezes mais afetadas do que a nossa"", conclui.

Perigo é “cada vez mais evidente”: enquanto estamos atentos às ameaças climáticas que vêm do sul, como doenças tropicais, podem estar a surgir simultaneamente ameaças do norte, em degelo.

As autoridades de saúde globais, incluindo a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS), estão a soar o alarme sobre uma potencial nova crise de saúde: o despertar de antigos “vírus zombie” provenientes do pergelissolo — a camada do subsolo permanentemente congelada.

Alguns destes patógenos atingem os 50 mil anos de idade e foram desenterrados de camadas do pergelissolo da Sibéria, segundo uma investigação partilhada esta segunda-feira em relatório da Bloomberg. As preocupações intensificaram-se numa fase pós-Covid-19, dada a ausência de imunidade e de tratamentos disponíveis para estes vírus.

O principal culpado para o despertar destes gigantes zombies é, mais uma vez, o aquecimento global, que está, enquanto lê este artigo, a descongelar esta camada permanente. Uma vez que o Ártico poderá ficar sem gelo até aos verões da década de 2030, a libertação de patógenos antigos apresenta uma nova frente de riscos.

Paralelamente aos gases com efeito de estufa, como o metano, os patógenos dormentes no pergelissolo representam um perigo subestimado.

No ano passado, segundo o Financial Express, a equipa liderada pelo professor na Universidade de Aix-Marselha, Jean-Michel Claverie, que está a estudar estes zombies, publicou uma investigação que revelou que múltiplos vírus antigos extraídos do pergelissolo siberiano continuavam infecciosos.

Perigo é “cada vez mais evidente”

A reanimação de patógenos não é apenas teórica. Um surto de antraz na Sibéria em 2016, ativado por uma onda de calor, resultou em inúmeras infeções e levou à morte de milhares de renas e de uma criança.

Um estudo separado deste ano também conseguiu reanimar um nematelminto com 46 mil anos, acrescentando outra camada de preocupação.

Segundo Claverie, o perigo é “cada vez mais evidente”: enquanto consideramos normalmente ameaças climáticas a emanar do sul, como doenças tropicais, também poderão estar a surgir ameaças do norte, em degelo.

A OMS tem monitorizado doenças infeciosas desconhecidas contra as quais os humanos nem têm imunidade nem terapias medicinais para tratar. A organização incluiu uma “Doença X” genérica na sua lista de patógenos prioritários que requerem investigação urgente.

Embora a investigação esteja a tornar-se cada vez mais complicada devido a tensões geopolíticas e ao medo do desencadeamento de novas pandemias, permanece essencial.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",vírus zombie acordar ano graças degelo pergelissolo siberiano perigo evidente estar atento ameaça climática sul doença tropical surgir simultaneamente ameaça norte degelo autoridade saúde global incluir organização mundial saúde oms soar alarme potencial crise saúde despertar antigo vírus zombie proveniente pergelissolo camada subsolo permanentemente congelar de este patógeno atingir ano idade desenterrar camada pergelissolo sibéria investigação partilhar segunda-feira relatório bloomberg preocupação intensificaramr se fase pós-covid- dar ausência imunidade tratamento disponível vírus principal culpar despertar de este gigante zombie aquecimento global ler artigo descongelar camado permanente ártico ficar gelo verão década libertação patógeno antigo apresentar frente risco paralelamente gase efeito estufa metano patógeno dormente pergelissolo representar perigo subestimar ano passado financial Express equipa liderar professor universidade aix-marselha jean-michel claverie estudar zombie publicar investigação revelar múltiplo vírus antigo extraído pergelissolo siberiano continuar infeccioso perigo evidente reanimação patógeno teórico surto antraz sibéria ativar onda calor resultar inúmero infeção levar morte milhar rena criança estudo separar ano conseguir reanimar nematelminto ano acrescentar camada preocupação claverie perigo evidente considerar normalmente ameaça climática emanar sul doença tropical poder surgir ameaça norte degelo oms monitorizar doença infecioso desconhecir humano imunidade terapia medicinal tratar organização incluir doença genérico lista patógeno prioritário requer investigação urgente investigação estar tornar se complicado devido tensão geopolítico medo desencadeamento pandemia permanecer essencial

António Tânger Corrêa, que foi secretário geral da Juventude Centrista (CDS) e adjunto do Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Diogo Freitas do Amaral no governo da AD original, foi confirmado este fim-de-semana na imprensa como Cabeça de lista pelo Chega nas próximas Eleições Europeias.

O ex-embaixador é protagonista em várias polémicas, com uma longa história de 30 anos a pisar o risco, segundo o Jornal Público, onde se destaca a “oferta” de um veleiro, que afinal foram dois (pode ler no Facebook – aqui  a história completa).

Segundo o mesmo jornal o percurso de “António Ranger” é um catálogo de “casos” que incluiu ter arrombado uma casa e ter sido suspenso pelo MNE com uma pena inédita na profissão — a primeira a um embaixador no ativo e em funções no estrangeiro.

António Tânger, que seguiu os passos do seu pai na carreira diplomática, foi suspenso em 2009 durante 90 dias devido a várias irregularidades encontradas na gestão da embaixada portuguesa na capital da Lituânia, Vilnius.

Mas as polémicas do Nº 1 do Chega às Europeias de junho de 2024 não se ficam por situações enquanto era representante de Portugal, mais recentemente, e já como vice-presidente do partido de André Ventura adotou um posição contrária ao líder do partido acusando o Governo do Presidente Zelensky de ter responsabilidades na invasão da Ucrânia, usando uma mensagem copiada.

Em fevereiro de 2022, dias antes de se iniciar a invasão da Ucrânia pela Rússia, António Tânger começou por fazer um prognóstico errado e a criticar os “comentadeiros metem dó pela ignorância” pois “alguma vez vai haver uma guerra?”

Depois desse comentário “copiou” um texto no facebook que acusa o presidente da Ucrânia e justifica a posição da Rússia. Esse texto foi colocado na sua página sem identificar o autor, posteriormente identificado depois do responsável contestar a cópia, e posteriormente foi apagado da sua página após ser notícia também no Expresso.

Meses antes, em setembro de 2021, o vice-presidente do Chega revelou à imprensa uma Teoria da Conspiração que depois não foi confirmada, ao anunciar um “Segredo de Estado” antes das eleições, pois segundo o ex-embaixador tinha sido criado um “grupo de trabalho entre as secretas e a Polícia Judiciária para incriminar o Chega” numa alegada ligação aos negacionistas.

Em janeiro de 2023, no segundo dia da V Convenção do Chega em Santarém, António Tânger Corrêa lembrou os tempos em que foi líder da Juventude Centrista para pedir maior presença e dinamismo à Juventude Chega: 

Eu não quero que a Juventude Chega seja igual às outras. Eu queria ver a Juventude Chega, chamem-me saudosista ou o que quiserem, a lutar nas ruas à cacetada com o MRPP e com o PCP.

Após uma reunião entre o presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden, e os líderes do Congresso norte-americano, o congressista alerta que a assistência à Ucrânia não deve estar no topo da agenda dos legisladores do país.

A Ucrânia será derrotada pela Rússia se não obtiver ajuda dos EUA, e os aliados do regime de Kiev afastar-se-ão de Washington.

A afirmação foi feita esta terça-feira (27) pelo líder democrata do Senado, Chuck Schumer, após uma reunião do presidente norte-americano, Joe Biden, com os líderes do Congresso.

""O consenso na sala foi que [Vladimir] Zelensky e a Ucrânia perderão a guerra se não fornecermos armas rapidamente"", disse Schumer aos jornalistas após a reunião.

Schumer afirmou que a ajuda dos EUA à Ucrânia não pode esperar pela aprovação do Congresso, uma vez que Washington não pode permitir que Kiev perca o conflito.

""Na melhor das hipóteses, haverá uma divisão na NATO [Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte], e os aliados afastar-se-ão dos Estados Unidos"", disse o congressista.

Acrescentou que existem quatro brigadas das Forças Armadas ucranianas ociosas no campo de batalha devido à falta de armas e munições.

Devido à posição da maioria republicana na Câmara dos Representantes, o Congresso dos EUA ainda não apoiou o pedido da administração Biden para aprovar novos fundos para Kiev. As dotações anteriormente atribuídas terminaram em Dezembro do ano passado.

Também após a reunião desta terça-feira (27), o presidente da Câmara dos Representantes dos EUA, o congressista republicano Mike Johnson, afirmou que a prestação de assistência à Ucrânia não deveria estar no topo da agenda dos legisladores norte-americanos.

""O meu objetivo hoje era expressar a verdade óbvia: as necessidades dos EUA precisam de ser satisfeitas primeiro. Quando se fala sobre isso, é preciso falar sobre uma fronteira aberta [na questão dos imigrantes]. A outra prioridade é financiar o nosso governo"", disse Johnson aos repórteres.

A Rússia acredita que o fornecimento de armas à Ucrânia interfere com as tentativas de iniciar negociações de paz e envolve diretamente os países da NATO no conflito.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, observou que qualquer carga que contenha armas para a Ucrânia se tornará um alvo legítimo para a Rússia.

Segundo o mesmo, os Estados Unidos e a NATO estão diretamente envolvidos no conflito, não só pelo fornecimento de armas, mas também pelo treino de combatentes em territórios do Reino Unido, Alemanha, Itália e outros países.

O Kremlin afirmou que inundar a Ucrânia com armas do Ocidente não contribui para as negociações e terá um efeito negativo.

E isso traz implicações “preocupantes”

O aquecimento global está a tornar os oceanos mais estáveis, aumentando as temperaturas da superfície e reduzindo o carbono que podem absorver. Cientistas alertam que estas descobertas têm implicações “profundas e preocupantes”.

Nos oceanos, as temperaturas mais altas desaceleram a mistura entre a superfície aquecida e as águas que se encontram mais abaixo, que são mais frias e ricas em oxigénio. Esta “estratificação”, explica o site Science Alert, significa que menos águas profundas estão a subir em direção à superfície, carregando oxigénio e nutrientes, enquanto a água na superfície absorve menos dióxido de carbono atmosférico.

Num relatório publicado, a 28 de setembro, na revista científica Nature Climate Change, uma equipa internacional de cientistas disse ter descoberto que a estratificação global aumentou nuns “substanciais” 5,3% de 1960 a 2018.

Os investigadores também disseram que este processo é exacerbado pelo derretimento do gelo marinho, o que significa que mais água doce, que é mais leve do que a salgada, também se acumula na superfície do oceano.

Num artigo publicado na revista Newsweek, o co-autor do estudo, Michael Mann, professor da Universidade Estadual da Pensilvânia, nos Estados Unidos, disse que esta “descoberta tem implicações profundas e preocupantes”.

O investigador considera que isto pode levar, potencialmente, a mais “furacões destrutivos e intensos” à medida que a superfície do oceano aquece, e também apontou para uma redução na quantidade de CO2 absorvida, o que pode significar que a poluição de carbono se acumula mais rapidamente do que o esperado na atmosfera.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans']",oceano ficar estável trazer implicação preocupante aquecimento global tornar oceano estável aumentar temperatura superfície reduzir carbono absorver cientista alertar descoberta implicação profundo preocupante oceano temperatura alta desaceler mistura superfície aquecir água encontrar abaixo frio rica oxigénio estratificação explicar site sciencer alert significar água profundo subir direção superfície carregar oxigénio nutriente água superfície absorver dióxir carbono atmosférico relatório publicar setembro revista científico naturar climate change equipa internacional cientista dizer descobrir estratificação global aumentar substancial investigador dizer processo exacerbar derretimento gelo marinho significar água doce leve salgada acumular superfície oceano artigo publicar revista newsweek co-autor estudo michael mann professor universidade estadual pensilvânia Estados Unidos dizer descoberta implicação profundo preocupante investigador considerar levar potencialmente furacão destrutivo intenso medida superfície oceano aquecer apontar redução quantidade co absorver significar poluição carbono acumular rapidamente esperar atmosfera

A Rússia, excluída dos Jogos Olímpicos de Paris-2024 pela sua ofensiva contra a Ucrânia, afirmou este sábado (27) que a cerimónia de abertura do evento desportivo foi um ""grande fracasso"", enquanto o primeiro-ministro da Hungria, Viktor Orban, declarou que a festa refletia a ""fragilidade e a desintegração do Ocidente"".

A porta-voz da diplomacia russa, Maria Zakharova, destacou no Telegram o que considerou falhas do espetáculo, que decorreu na sexta-feira (26) no rio Sena.

""Não tinha planeado ver a abertura. Mas depois de ver as fotos, nem queria acreditar que não era um 'deep fake' ou photoshop"", escreveu no Telegram. A cerimónia não foi exibida em direto pela televisão russa.

Zakharova citou, entre outros pontos, o ""colapso dos transportes"", depois de a rede ferroviária francesa ter sofrido atos de sabotagem, e ""espectadores sentados durante horas debaixo de uma chuva intensa"".

""Os organizadores não pensaram na dispersão das nuvens nem em toldos"", acrescentou, numa referência à prática russa de enviar aviões antes de grandes eventos ao ar livre para tentar romper as nuvens.

Zakharova disse ainda que o centro de Paris foi ""transformado num gueto para pessoas sem-abrigo"" e que ""ratos inundaram as ruas"" da capital.

A porta-voz criticou em particular a presença de ‘drag queens’ num momento da cerimónia, cuja encenação recordava a última ceia de Jesus Cristo com os seus apóstolos.

""Em Paris, decidiram que, se os anéis olímpicos são multicoloridos, pode-se transformar tudo numa marcha gay gigante"", acrescentou.

Apenas 16 atletas russos aceitaram o convite do Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) para participar no evento sob bandeira neutra.

Na Hungria, Orban afirmou que o espetáculo mostrou o ""vazio"" ocidental.

""Eliminaram gradualmente os laços metafísicos, com Deus, a pátria e a família"", disse o chefe do Governo húngaro, acrescentando que isso levou à ""ausência de moralidade pública"".

Segundo Orban, que defende uma doutrina ""iliberal"", ""os valores ocidentais, considerados universais durante muito tempo, são, cada vez mais, considerados inaceitáveis e rejeitados por muitos países do mundo"", como a China, a Índia, a Turquia ou os países árabes.

Os líderes mundiais do G20 vão reunir-se numa cimeira de dois dias - a 9 e 10 de setembro - organizada pela Presidência indiana do G20 em Nova Deli. Sob o lema ""Uma Terra - Uma Família - Um Futuro"" serão debatidas, em clima de tensão, as divergências profundas sobre a guerra da Rússia na Ucrânia, a reestruturação da dívida e a eliminação progressiva dos combustíveis fósseis, o que dificultará a obtenção de uma declaração comum no domingo.

Joe Biden, Rishi Sunak, Emmanuel Macron e outros líderes do G20 vão estar em Nova Deli para a 18ª Cimeira do Grupo dos 20.

Xi Jinping e Vladimir Putin não marcarão presença, deixando a representação nacional a cargo de Li Qiang, o primeiro-ministro chinês, que chefiará a delegação chinesa e de Sergei Lavrov, ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, que chefiará a delegação russa.

Narendra Modi, o primeiro-ministro da Índia – país anfitrião do encontro anual – espera afirmar a crescente influência diplomática do país e facilitar o diálogo sobre os assuntos que dividem o G20: a guerra da Rússia na Ucrânia e as alterações climáticas.

A falta de consenso relativamente à guerra na Ucrânia ameaça descarrilar a reunião, prejudicando o progresso em questões como a segurança alimentar, a reestruturação da dívida e a cooperação em matéria de alterações climáticas.

“O custo da inação será catastrófico""

A Cimeira do G20 decorre enquanto “o mundo está no fio da navalha. A crise climática está a infligir danos imensos às pessoas, os direitos humanos de milhares de milhões de pessoas estão ameaçados”, afirmou Agnès Callamard, secretária-geral da Amnistia Internacional, em comunicado esta semana.

De acordo com a Amnistia Internacional, “é vital que o G20 reconheça a magnitude e a urgência destas crises e atue rapidamente para impedir a escalada dos desastres climáticos e da dívida”, caso contrário “o custo da inação será catastrófico"", acrescentou.

Na anterior cimeira do G20, em novembro de 2022, organizada pela presidência indonésia do G20 em Bali, os líderes debateram o impacto da guerra da Rússia contra a Ucrânia na economia mundial e, em especial a segurança alimentar e energética.

Apesar de terem emitido uma declaração comum, a Amnistia Internacional considera que até agora não foi honrada e apela ao seu cumprimento, assim como a adoção de novos compromissos.

Esta cimeira do G20 antecede outras ocasiões-chave em que os países estarão novamente reunidos, como a semana de alto nível da Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas e a Cimeira de Ambição Climática do secretário-geral da ONU no final deste mês, ambas em Nova Iorque, assim como a reunião sobre o clima COP28 no Dubai, que começa a 30 de novembro.",PT,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],cimeira g. desafio líder mundial gestão paz dívida clima líder mundial reunir se cimeira dia setembro organizar presidência indiano deli lema terra família futuro ser debatir clima tensão divergência profundo guerra Rússia ucrânia reestruturação dívida eliminação progressivo combustível fóssil dificultar obtenção declaração comum domingo joe biden rishi Sunak emmanuel macron líder deli cimeira xi jinping vladimir putin marcar presença deixar representação nacional cargo li Qiang primeiro-ministro chinês chefiar delegação chinês sergei lavrov ministro negócio estrangeiro russo chefiar delegação russo narendra modi primeiro-ministro índia país anfitrião encontro anual esperar afirmar crescente influência diplomático país facilitar diálogo assunto dividir guerra Rússia ucrânia alteração climática consenso relativamente guerra ucrânia ameaçar descarrilar reunião prejudicar progresso questão segurança alimentar reestruturação dívida cooperação matéria alteração climática custo inação ser catastrófico cimeira decorrer mundo fio navalha crise climático infligir dano imenso pessoa direito humano milhar milhão pessoa ameaçado afirmar agnès callamard secretária-geral amnistia internacional comunicado semana acordo amnistia internacional vital reconhecer magnitude urgência de este crise atuar rapidamente impedir escalada desastr climático dívida caso contrário custo inação ser catastrófico acrescentar anterior cimeira novembro organizar presidência indonésio bali líder debater impacto guerra rússia ucrânia economia mundial especial segurança alimentar energético apesar ter emitir declaração comum amnistir internacional considerar honrado apelar cumprimento adoção compromisso cimeira anteceder ocasiões-chave país estar novamente reunido semana alto assembleia nação unir cimeira ambição climático secretário-geral onu iorque reunião clima cop dubai começar novembro

O mundo está a caminhar para uma série de ""pontos de inflexão"" ambientais que podem causar danos irreversíveis no abastecimento de água e noutros sistemas de suporte à vida, alertou um braço de investigação da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) esta quarta- feira.

As alterações climáticas e o uso excessivo de recursos têm colocado o mundo à beira de seis pontos de inflexão interligados que ""poderão desencadear alterações abruptas nos nossos sistemas de suporte da vida e abalar os alicerces das sociedades"", afirmou o Instituto do Ambiente e da Segurança Humana da Universidade das Nações Unidas (UNU-EHS).

""Quando estes limites são ultrapassados, o sistema deixa de funcionar normalmente e surgem novos riscos em cascata, que podem ser transferidos para outros sistemas"", disse o investigador Jack O'Connor, autor do relatório.

""Devemos esperar que estas coisas aconteçam porque, em certas áreas, já estão a acontecer.""

O relatório Interconnected Disaster Risks (Riscos de Desastres Interconectados), publicado antes das negociações climáticas da COP28 no próximo mês, identificou taxas aceleradas de extinção, esgotamento de águas subterrâneas, degelo glacial e calor extremo como as principais ameaças interligadas.

O documento alertava que 1 milhão de plantas e animais poderiam ser dizimados ""dentro de décadas"", com a perda de espécies importantes a poder ""desencadear extinções em cascata de espécies dependentes"" e aumentar a probabilidade de colapso do ecossistema.

Muitos dos maiores aquíferos do mundo já estão a esgotar-se mais rapidamente do que podem ser reabastecidos, com a Arábia Saudita, a Índia e os Estados Unidos a enfrentarem já graves riscos. Os escoamentos do degelo dos glaciares também estão em declínio.

""O calor está a levar-nos a extrair mais água subterrânea por causa da seca"", disse Caitlyn Eberle, outra autora do estudo. ""Muitos destes glaciares nas Montanhas Rochosas, nos Himalaias e nos Andes alimentam estes rios e sistemas de águas subterrâneas, pelo que, à medida que estes glaciares desaparecem, há menos água disponível.""

Os investigadores alertaram ainda para os riscos crescentes apresentados pelos detritos espaciais, com colisões que podem tornar a órbita da Terra ""inutilizável"" e impossibilitar futuras atividades espaciais, incluindo a monitorização por satélite de ameaças ambientais.

Noutro ponto de viragem, o agravamento dos riscos climáticos está a tornar os seguros inacessíveis, com meio milhão de casas só na Austrália que não poderão ser seguradas até 2030, segundo eles.

""Quando este ponto é ultrapassado, as pessoas ficam sem uma rede de segurança económica quando ocorrem desastres"", referiu o relatório.

A Retrospetiva 2023, exibida esta sexta-feira (29) na TV Globo, mostrou que o ano foi marcado por eventos climáticos extremos e desastres naturais que castigaram o mundo. No meio dos debates sobre as alterações climáticas, o planeta registou milhares de mortes provocadas pela natureza.

Em agosto, os incêndios florestais destruíram parte da ilha de Maui, no Havai. Houve mais de 90 mortos e milhares de desalojados no maior desastre natural provocado pelo fogo num século nos Estados Unidos. Em fuga, os moradores tiveram de conduzir no meio das chamas para escapar.

Cercados pelas chamas, os brasileiros tiveram de se atirar ao mar para salvar a própria vida.

Logo nos primeiros dias de 2023, uma tempestade castigou o litoral de São Paulo. O local mais atingido foi a Vila Sahy, na cidade de São Sebastião.

No Rio Grande do Sul, a chuva também castigou a população, que viu o estado ter o maior desastre natural da sua história.

No Nordeste, o desastre anunciado veio em Maceió (AL). A capital alagoana entrou em alerta máximo após o colapso de uma mina da Braskem utilizada para a exploração de sal-gema. O processo provocou instabilidade e obrigou os moradores a abandonar as suas casas.

E ainda antes de chegar o verão, as ondas de calor deram o sinal do impacto do fenómeno El Niño no Brasil. Com a temperatura a ultrapassar os 40 °C e a sensação térmica acima dos 50 °C, as cidades ficaram em alerta.

Tragédias pelo mundo

Na Islândia, a atividade vulcânica fez a terra tremer milhares de vezes por dia. Os moradores tiveram de abandonar as suas casas, até que veio a erupção, despejando muita lava.

Derna, na Líbia, foi destruída por uma enxurrada após a Tempestade.

Na Turquia e na Síria, um terramoto devastador comoveu o mundo. Um dos grandes desafios para os cientistas é ainda prever quando um grande tremor está a caminho.

Em Marrocos, outro sismo causou enorme destruição. As imagens mostram quando centenas de pessoas celebravam um casamento e a terra começou a tremer. O número de mortos chegou aos 2.900, com mais de 5.500 pessoas feridas.

1. O reitor da Universidade de Coimbra acha que pode despedir o diretor do Centro de Estudos Russos daquela Universidade com a mesma arbitrariedade com que um qualquer patrão de uma empresa de vão-de-escada despede um jovem em período experimental. Não há processo disciplinar, não há factos que o justifiquem. Há o facto de o demitido diretor ser russo e há a delação feita por dois ucranianos de que o diretor recomenda livros de autores russos e tem uma opinião sobre a guerra da Ucrânia que não coincide com a dos delatores.

Em todas as notícias que vieram a público sobre este despedimento, feito à margem de qualquer processo legal, o que é grave numa instituição pública, não há mais factos que o justifiquem a não ser a nacionalidade do autor e a delação acerca das suas opiniões.

É uma evidência que estamos perante uma grosseira violação do artigo 13.º da Constituição da República Portuguesa, segundo o qual ninguém pode ser prejudicado ou privado de qualquer direito em razão da sua língua, território de origem, religião, convicções políticas ou ideológicas.

Que os delatores ucranianos ignorem a Constituição portuguesa e os direitos democráticos que ela consagra não me espanta, mas que seja o reitor de uma Universidade a promover um despedimento sumário de um professor com base na sua nacionalidade e por delito de opinião, é algo que me espanta, me indigna, e que considero ser um enxovalho para uma Universidade cujo prestígio devia ser defendido. Não vivêssemos nós no clima de caça às bruxas que tem sido imposto a este canto ocidental do mundo e a notícia de um reitor que, num ato de total prepotência, despede sumariamente um professor, violando os seus direitos fundamentais com o mesmo grau de displicência com que proíbe a carne de vaca nas cantinas, seria motivo de escândalo nacional e internacional.

2. Manuel Pires da Rocha é um prestigiado músico e professor de música português. É conhecido publicamente por ser o violinista da Brigada Victor Jara, mas tem um passado e um presente de enorme prestígio no ensino da música, nomeadamente como professor e diretor do Conservatório de Coimbra. Estudou em Moscovo, onde obteve o curso superior de violino e, ao contrário de outros, respeita o país onde estudou e o povo que o acolheu. Na passada semana, Manuel Pires da Rocha foi alvo de um bufo que se identificou como “judeu de origens ucranianas”, que enviou um email aos professores do Conservatório a denunciar a sua presença nas comemorações do Dia da Vitória sobre o nazi-fascismo em Lisboa. A resposta a esta ignomínia foi dada pelo próprio Manuel Rocha com o brilho intelectual que lhe é reconhecido e cuja leitura vivamente recomendo.

3.

A derrota dos Estados Unidos na sua guerra por procuração na Ucrânia ameaça desacreditar totalmente a hegemonia ocidental.

""A liderança mundial dos Estados Unidos está em jogo"", afirmou Mark Sleboda no último episódio do programa ""The Final Countdown"", na terça-feira.

""Eu acho que [uma derrota na Ucrânia] seria muito pior do que a retirada do Afeganistão, porque a maioria dos analistas ocidentais considera isso - e eu concordo com eles - como um conflito que molda a ordem mundial"", continuou o analista. ""Boris Johnson, o antigo primeiro-ministro britânico, disse-o sem rodeios: a hegemonia mundial ocidental liderada pelos EUA está em jogo"".

A ordem mundial liderada pelos EUA está atualmente a ser desacreditada em várias frentes. Do ponto de vista económico, o Ocidente está a falhar, com uma desigualdade crescente e uma perda de dinamismo e inovação para o Sul Global, liderado pela China. A sua reputação está em frangalhos à medida que a brutalidade genocida do seu Estado cliente israelita é totalmente revelada.

️Agora, a derrota da Ucrânia está a eliminar a aura de invencibilidade militar do Ocidente, uma vez que o seu melhor planeamento e armamento deixaram a desejar.

""Acreditam numa teoria pós-moderna do dominó que, se forem vistos a perder aqui na Ucrânia contra a Rússia... isso seria uma espécie de sinal da teoria moderna do dominó"", afirma Sleboda. ""Por isso, não há rampa de saída. Acho que nem sequer há uma conceção de ver uma rampa de saída, certamente não de Biden-Harris. ""

Mesmo os atuais ataques das tropas ucranianas contra o território russo envolvem oficiais da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO), afirmou o presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, comentando a possibilidade de o Ocidente autorizar Kiev a atacar a Rússia com as suas armas de longo alcance.

O presidente russo reafirmou a sua declaração de que as armas ocidentais de longo alcance não podem ser utilizadas sem a participação direta dos militares destes países, uma vez que a Ucrânia não dispõe de capacidades tecnológicas para utilizar tais armas.

Putin explicou, em privado, que as armas deste tipo necessitam de meios e dados de inteligência espacial militar que a Ucrânia não possui. Além disso, são necessários especialistas para processar os dados de inteligência e operar as armas.

""Não se trata de saber se alguém permitirá ou não utilizar estas armas contra a Rússia. [...] As tropas ucranianas não podem utilizar estas armas por si próprias. [...] A única questão é se eles [NATO] vão permitir-se atacar o território russo em profundidade.

O presidente russo afirmou que o Ministério da Defesa russo está a considerar várias opções para responder a possíveis ataques de longo alcance ao território russo.

Contudo, o líder russo disse esperar que o Ocidente tenha ouvido os seus sinais de que permitir ataques de longo alcance contra territórios russos localizados longe da zona de conflito significaria que a NATO está diretamente em guerra com a Rússia.

Uma fonte da defesa ucraniana afirmou que vários 'drones' atacaram a refinaria de Tuapse, uma cidade nas margens do Mar Negro, na região russa de Krasnodar (sudoeste), provocando um incêndio.

""A extensão dos danos está a ser clarificada"", disse a fonte ucraniana, especificando que se trata de uma refinaria da gigante russa Rosneft, equipada com um terminal portuário e que quase 90% da sua produção se destina à exportação.

Na rede social Telegram, as autoridades regionais russas afirmaram, por sua vez, que o incêndio na refinaria ocorreu devido à ""queda de destroços de 'drones'"".

""O regime de Kyiv tentou mais uma vez atacar a infraestrutura civil em Tuapse com 'drones'"", disseram as fontes russas.

Cerca de uma centena de equipas de resgate foram mobilizadas para o local e controlaram as chamas ao início da manhã de hoje e, segundo informações preliminares, não há vítimas.

Paralelamente, um condutor de um trator foi morto hoje por um 'drone' e a sua mulher ficou ferida enquanto trabalhavam num campo agrícola, perto da aldeia de Ustinka, na região russa de Belgorod (oeste), segundo o governador local, Vyacheslav Gladkov, que identificou o aparelho não tripulado como ucraniano.

O exército russo anunciou hoje que abateu 80 'drones' ucranianos desde a noite de domingo, incluindo 47 só na região sul de Rostov, na fronteira com a Ucrânia.

Segundo essa fonte, um 'drone' foi destruído em Belgorod, um outro em Voronezh, outro em Smolensk, oito em Krasnodar e 17 nos mares Negro e de Azov.

Num comunicado separado, o exército russo acrescentou que destruiu cinco 'drones', por volta das 07h00 (05h00 em Lisboa), sobre a região de Astrakan.

A Rússia anuncia quase diariamente que destruiu 'drones' ucranianos lançados contra o seu território.

PT_162.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans,"Observação do plâncton: porque é tão importante para prever a próxima extinção em massa?


E se observássemos atentamente os movimentos do plâncton nos oceanos? Não, não se trata de uma sugestão rebuscada para ocupar as suas tardes, mas sim de um estudo muito sério com resultados surpreendentes realizado por uma equipa de investigadores das Universidades de Bristol (Reino Unido), Harvard, Texas (EUA) e Victoria (Austrália), publicado na revista Nature.

O que é que aconteceu há 53 milhões de anos?

Estes cientistas descobriram que, há cerca de 50 milhões de anos (mais precisamente entre 53 e 49 milhões de anos), quase todo o plâncton marinho, ou seja, todas as plantas e animais aquáticos que andam à deriva com as correntes, se deslocou para as latitudes mais elevadas, entre o Círculo Polar Antártico e o Pólo Sul.

Esta mudança surpreendente precedeu em vários milhões de anos uma extinção em massa de espécies marinhas no oceano. O que é ainda mais preocupante é que durante este período do Eoceno, entre 53 e 49 milhões de anos atrás, houve um ""ótimo climático"", ou seja, um período de temperaturas globais ""persistentemente elevadas"" que curiosamente faz lembrar os dias de hoje.

Os climatologistas estão inevitavelmente muito preocupados, uma vez que este ""ótimo climático do Eoceno"" está próximo dos cenários mais pessimistas de aquecimento global atualmente em estudo. É evidente que o plâncton deve ser objeto de um exame minucioso neste momento, pois a mais pequena alteração pode significar o mesmo cenário desastroso do Eoceno, com uma extinção em massa das espécies.

Um ""sistema de alerta precoce""

É claro que os autores do estudo explicam que o passado nunca é o espelho do futuro e que se trata apenas de uma correlação entre o movimento do plâncton e o desaparecimento de espécies, não sendo de modo algum uma relação causal. No entanto, acreditam que o plâncton poderia funcionar como um aviso antes de uma suposta onda de extinção de espécies marinhas de maior dimensão.

O coautor do estudo, o Dr. Adam Woodhouse (Bristol), descreve, no entanto, o resultado como ""entusiasmante"", acrescentando que a observação do plâncton pode constituir um ""sistema de alerta precoce"" para prever a extinção da vida nos oceanos.

De facto, ao aplicar o seu modelo informático aos arquivos, a sua equipa revelou que, desde o desaparecimento dos dinossauros, as alterações no plâncton precederam frequentemente a extinção de certos organismos.",PT,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans'],observação plâncton importante prever extinção massa observásser atentamente movimento plâncton oceano tratar sugestão rebuscar ocupar tarde estudo sério resultado surpreendente realizar equipa investigador universidade bristol reino unir harvard texa EUA victor austrália publicar revista nature acontecer há milhão ano cientista descobrir haver cerca milhão ano precisamente milhão ano quase plâncton marinho ser planta animal aquático andar deriva corrente deslocar latitude elevada círculo polar antártico pólo sul mudança surpreendente preceder milhão ano extinção massa espécie marinho oceano preocupante durante período eoceno milhão ano haver bom climático ser período temperatura global persistentemente elevada curiosamente lembrar dia hoje climatologista inevitavelmente preocupado bom climático eoceno cenário pessimista aquecimento global atualmente estudo evidente plâncton objeto exame minucioso pequeno alteração significar cenário desastroso eoceno extinção massa espécie alerta precoce claro autor estudo explicar passado espelho futuro tratar correlação movimento plâncton desaparecimento espécie ser modo algum causal entanto acreditar plâncton poder funcionar aviso suposto onda extinção espécie marinho dimensão coautor estudo dr. adar woodhouse bristol descrever entanto resultado entusiasmante acrescentar observação plâncton constituir alerta precoce prever extinção vida oceano facto aplicar modelo informático arquivo equipa revelar desaparecimento dinossauro alteração plâncton preceder frequentemente extinção certos organismo
PT_175.txt,CC: Criticism of climate policies,CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other,"Taxas ambientais nas passagens aéreas serão regra

Quando compra um bilhete de avião, opta por pagar um valor extra para compensar as emissões de carbono? Se a resposta for ""não"", não está sozinho. A adesão voluntária aos esquemas de compensação pode ser inferior a 3% das pessoas.

Em vez disso, a Lufthansa vai introduzir uma ""sobretaxa de custos ambientais"" obrigatória nos voos da UE, do Reino Unido, da Noruega ou da Suíça, a partir do início de 2025.

Isto representará um acréscimo de até 72 euros a um bilhete de primeira classe de longa distância. Nos voos de curta e média distância, será mais próximo de 1 euro a 7 euros.

A companhia aérea alemã provavelmente não estará sozinha. Espera-se que as sobretaxas verdes obrigatórias sejam adotadas especialmente pelas companhias tradicionais.

Uma série de regulamentos ambientais são os culpados, diz a Lufthansa. Ela cita os requisitos da UE para que o combustível de aviação inclua uma mistura de pelo menos 2% do combustível de aviação sustentável (SAF, na sigla em inglês) a partir do próximo ano, além de alterações nos esquemas de comércio de emissões (ETS ) na Europa.

A Air France-KLM lançou as bases em 2022 ao impor uma ""taxa de contribuição SAF"", cobrada a um nível inferior.

Cada alteração regulamentar por si só não é exorbitante. De facto, o SAF, produzido a partir de uma variedade de materiais, incluindo óleo alimentar reciclado, deverá custar pelo menos o dobro do preço histórico a longo prazo do querosene até 2050, de acordo com um relatório recente da LEK Consulting.

Mas suponha-se que a factura de combustível da Lufthansa em 2025 se mantém próxima dos 8,3 mil milhões de euros que prevê para 2024, um cálculo rápido sugere que a conformidade com as regras de mistura da UE de 2025 poderá custar mais 17 milhões de euros. Os níveis de mistura exigidos voltam a aumentar em 2030 e 2035.

As alterações ao esquema ETS da UE e a programas similares noutros locais serão mais dispendiosas. Atualmente, os poluidores recebem algumas permissões gratuitas, mas estão a ser reduzidas.

O impacto nas companhias aéreas tradicionais será maior, defende o analista da Goodbody, Dudley Shanley, uma vez que historicamente são maiores emissores e tendem a ter frotas menos eficientes.

Este ano, a Lufthansa espera receber certificados de emissão gratuitos para cerca de 2,8 milhões de toneladas de CO₂, em comparação com 3,8 milhões de toneladas em 2023, de acordo com o seu último relatório anual.

Esta redução poderá custar 65 milhões de euros, partindo da previsão da BloombergNEF para um preço médio de 65 euros por tonelada de emissão permitida da UE este ano. Prevê-se que subam para 80 euros/t em 2025.

Em tempos de bonança, estes custos poderiam ser absorvidos. A Lufthansa deverá ter um lucro líquido em 2025 de quase 1,8 mil milhões de euros, de acordo com os números da Visible Alpha.

No entanto, as companhias aéreas tradicionais lutam numa guerra perpétua para reduzir a grande diferença de custos em relação aos seus concorrentes de baixo custo.

Os passageiros podem queixar-se, mas a bagagem das taxas ambientais obrigatórias — pelo menos entre as principais companhias aéreas — poderá tornar-se a regra.

As autoridades russas acusaram, esta sexta-feira, a Ucrânia de tentar atacar a central nuclear de Kursk com um 'drone kamikaze', local que o responsável da Agência Internacional de Energia Atómica (AIEA), Rafael Grossi, visitará em breve.

Na noite de quinta-feira, ""o regime de Kiev tentou cometer um ato de terrorismo nuclear com um 'drone kamikaze' numa central nuclear localizada em Kurchatov, na região de Kursk"", denunciaram as autoridades russas, citadas pela agência de notícias TASS.

""Um veículo aéreo não tripulado ucraniano foi abatido nas proximidades da central nuclear"", relataram os serviços de segurança russos, explicando que a ogiva do 'drone' continha uma granada antitanque.

Esses acontecimentos exigem uma ""resposta imediata"" por parte da AIEA, declarou a porta-voz do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova.

A agência das Nações Unidas para o nuclear confirmou na quinta-feira que a Rússia informou da descoberta de restos de um 'drone' a poucos metros da central nuclear de Kursk, uma região parcialmente ocupada pela Ucrânia.

Segundo a agência, os fragmentos do 'drone' foram encontrados a cerca de 100 metros do depósito de combustível nuclear usado da central, após ter sido intercetado ""na madrugada de 22 de agosto"".

""A atividade militar nas proximidades de uma central nuclear representa um sério risco para a segurança nuclear"", alertou o diretor-geral da AIEA, Rafael Grossi, sem especificar de quem partiu o 'drone' abatido na zona da central.

O líder da agência da ONU anunciou ainda uma visita ao local durante a próxima semana.

O Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, acusou na quinta-feira a Ucrânia de ter lançado o ataque contra a central, o que Kiev negou horas depois, numa troca de acusações entre as partes.

A participar no Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas, que decorre em Nova Iorque esta semana, o presidente ucraniano afirmou que o seu denominado ""plano de vitória"" não visa negociar com a Moscovo, mas sim encontrar uma forma de pôr termo ao conflito diplomaticamente. O Kremlin avisou, esta quarta-feira, que ""forçar a Rússia"" a fazer a paz na Ucrânia, como Volodymyr Zelensky apelou ao discursar na ONU, seria um ""erro absolutamente fatal"".

“A posição de tentar forçar a Rússia a fazer a paz é um erro absolutamente fatal. É impossível forçar a Rússia a fazer a paz”, disse o porta-voz da Presidência russa, Dmitri Peskov, através de um comunicado à imprensa.

“A Rússia é a favor da paz”, frisou ainda, “mas com a condição de garantir os alicerces da sua segurança e alcançar os objetivos” da ofensiva na Ucrânia.

“Sem alcançar estes objetivos, é impossível restringir a Rússia”, rematou Peskov. Num discurso no Conselho de Segurança da ONU, na terça-feira, Zelensky apelou a um aliança entre as nações para “forçar a Rússia à paz”, dizendo que Vladimir Putin violou fundamentos da ONU e que o fim da guerra “não pode ser alcançado apenas através de negociações”.O presidente ucraniano acusou Moscovo de cometer “crimes internacionais” ao atacar civis ucranianos e infraestruturas de energia.

As negociações entre Moscovo e Kiev estão paralisadas desde a primavera de 2022, com cada lado a defender firmemente exigências irreconciliáveis. A Rússia recusou, entretanto, participar na segunda cimeira para a paz na Ucrânia.

A ofensiva russa continua, com o exército russo a anunciar, esta quarta-feira, que conquistou dois novos locais na região de Donetsk, no leste da Ucrânia.

Donald Trump acusou, esta quinta-feira, o presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelensky, de se recusar a chegar a um acordo para pôr fim à guerra com a Rússia: num evento em Charlotte, na Carolina do Norte, o candidato republicano lançou um dos ataques mais contundentes ao líder ucraniano, que se vai reunir hoje com o presidente Joe Biden, assim como com a vice-presidente Kamala Harris, rival democrata de Trump na corrida à Casa Branca.

“Continuamos a dar milhares de milhões de dólares a um homem que se recusa a fazer um acordo: Zelensky”, atacou Trump aos seus apoiantes. “Não havia nenhum acordo que ele pudesse ter feito que não fosse melhor do que a situação que se tem agora. Tem um país que foi destruído.”

Recorde-se que Donald Trump tem indicado, repetidamente, que se for eleito para um segundo mandato procurará imediatamente um acordo entre Moscovo e Kiev, tendo reforçado a mensagem durante a campanha nos últimos dias. “Estaremos presos nesta guerra a menos que eu seja presidente”, já havia indicado num evento de campanha, na Geórgia, esta terça-feira. “Vou resolver isto, vou negociar, vou sair. Temos de sair.”

Donald Trump mostrou-se igualmente irritado com os comentários de Zelensky no início da sua visita aos EUA, nos quais questionou a capacidade do ex-presidente para mediar rapidamente um acordo. “O presidente da Ucrânia está no nosso país e a fazer pequenas calúnias desagradáveis contra o seu presidente favorito.”

A visita de Zelensky aos EUA visa apresentar o plano de vitória de Kiev, que a colocasse numa melhor posição para resolver o conflito: embora seja expectável que apresente o plano a Biden e Harris, não há uma reunião marcada com Trump.

Além das críticas de Trump a Zelensky por se ter recusado a chegar a um acordo de paz com o líder russo Vladimir Putin, os republicanos ficaram perturbados com a visita do presidente ucraniano a uma fábrica de munições no estado indeciso da Pensilvânia, no início desta semana.

A Rússia afirmou, esta terça-feira, 6, ter repelido uma tentativa de incursão do Exército ucraniano na região fronteiriça de Kursk, após várias operações similares reivindicadas nos últimos meses por um grupo de combatentes pró-Kiev.

O governador interino de Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, também informou no Telegram que três civis morreram durante o dia, em ataques ucranianos, nesta região russa.

Segundo ele, soldados do Exército ucraniano realizaram ""tentativas de incursão"" nos distritos de Sudzhan e Korenevski.

""Os soldados do serviço da guarda fronteiriça e as Forças Armadas russas impediram o cruzamento da fronteira"", afirmou no Telegram, qualificando a situação de “difícil”.

Consultado pela AFP, um porta-voz do Exército ucraniano negou-se a comentar a situação na fronteira.
As forças russas ""fracassam na sua defesa"" da região de Kursk, assegurou Andri Kovalenko, um funcionário do Conselho Nacional de Segurança e Defesa ucraniana, sem dar mais detalhes.

Smirnov também reportou, esta terça-feira, ""bombardeamentos maciços"" e ataques de drones ucranianos dirigidos à sua região, que causaram pelo menos três mortes de civis e 13 feridos, incluindo quatro crianças.

Várias incursões de combatentes armados na Rússia ocorreram desde o início da ofensiva russa contra a Ucrânia, em fevereiro de 2022.

Em várias ocasiões, essas incursões foram reivindicadas pela ""Legião Liberdade da Rússia"" e pelo ""Corpo de Voluntários Russos"", grupos que se apresentam como formados por combatentes russos pró-Kiev e que Moscovo classifica como ""organizações terroristas"".

As suas operações aumentam a pressão sobre as localidades russas próximas da Ucrânia, submetidas regularmente a bombardeamentos mortais, em represália pelos ataques russos no território ucraniano.

O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, afirmou que a Rússia irá considerar eventuais tropas norte-americanas enviadas para a Ucrânia como intervencionistas.

As declarações foram feitas durante a entrevista ao diretor-geral do grupo mediático Rossiya Segodnya, do qual a Sputnik faz parte, Dmitry Kiselev.

Putin respondeu ao anúncio de que os EUA não enviariam tropas para a Ucrânia, afirmando que a Rússia não subestimaria a gravidade de tal ação.

""Sabemos o que são tropas norte-americanas em território russo, são tropas de intervenção, e é assim que as vamos tratar, mesmo que apareçam em território da Ucrânia"", afirmou o presidente russo.

Putin salientou que Washington compreende a posição da Rússia sobre este assunto. As tensões entre a Rússia e o Ocidente têm vindo a aumentar desde 2014 e os EUA e os seus aliados da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) têm apoiado Kiev.

Putin, na entrevista, também não descartou a possibilidade de a Rússia realizar testes nucleares se os EUA o fizerem. ""Se realizarem tais testes, não excluo, não é obrigatório, se precisarmos disso, não precisamos, ainda temos de pensar, mas não excluo que possamos fazer o mesmo.""

Especificou que as forças russas estão preparadas para uma guerra nuclear: ""Do ponto de vista militar, é claro que estamos prontos. As nossas forças estão constantemente em estado de prontidão.""

""Eu disse que [o presidente dos EUA, Joe] Biden é uma pessoa representante da escola política tradicional, e isso está a ser confirmado. Lá, além de Biden, há muitos outros especialistas em relações russo-americanas e em estratégia de dissuasão. Portanto, não acredito que tudo esteja a encaminhar-se diretamente para isso, mas nós estamos preparados.""

Salientou que existe um tratado que proíbe testes deste tipo. Os norte-americanos não ratificaram o Tratado de Proibição Total de Ensaios Nucleares (CTBT, na sigla inglesa), e a Rússia retirou a sua ratificação para manter a paridade, recordou o presidente russo.

""Como o tratado não foi ratificado pelos Estados Unidos, não entrou em vigor legalmente, porque não recebeu o número necessário de ratificações. No entanto, ainda observamos estes acordos"", disse Putin.

No entanto, acrescentou que nos EUA está a ser considerada a possibilidade de realizar tais testes. ""Isto está relacionado com o facto de que, quando surgem novas ogivas, alguns especialistas acreditam que não é suficiente testá-las apenas no computador, precisam de ser testadas em condições reais.""

""Estas ideias estão a circular em certos grupos nos EUA. Nós sabemos disso. E também estamos a observar"", disse o presidente russo.

O tratado multilateral foi adotado pela Assembleia Geral da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) em 10 de setembro de 1996, com o objetivo de prevenir a proliferação de armas nucleares em todas as suas vertentes.

A 2 de novembro de 2023, o líder russo assinou a lei pela qual a Rússia retira a sua ratificação do CTBT.

Em 2023, os ponteiros marcaram 90 segundos para a meia-noite, ponto que representa o fim da humanidade. Esta é a primeira vez que atinge essa marca. O ponteiro é simbólico e representa a proximidade de uma catástrofe global. À medida que a situação melhora ou piora, o ponteiro mexe-se para a frente ou para trás.

O Relógio do Juízo Final foi criado após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, em 1947. Representa a avaliação do risco de uma catástrofe global, como uma guerra nuclear ou as alterações climáticas.

Uma atualização recente ocorreu em janeiro de 2020, quando o relógio foi ajustado para 100 segundos para a meia-noite, marcando o ponto mais próximo da meia-noite, desde a criação do relógio. Meses depois, o mundo sofreu com a pandemia da Covid-19.

Para além do Relógio do Juízo Final, o fim da humanidade foi constantemente retratado em vários filmes de Hollywood.

É o caso de 'O dia em que a terra parou', de 1951 e 2008. O filme aborda a chegada de uma esfera alienígena ao planeta. Este ser transmite uma importante mensagem de destruição do planeta e de ameaça à vida. A tónica do filme aborda as consequências destrutivas das ações humanas no planeta, como a questão ambiental e as escolhas que a humanidade deve fazer de olhos postos no futuro. Os cientistas descobrem uma instabilidade no núcleo da Terra, que provoca desastres globais. À medida que os eventos catastróficos se desenrolam, as personagens principais enfrentam terramotos, erupções vulcânicas e tsunamis em todo o mundo.

Lançado em 2009, 'Presságio' é um filme de ficção científica que gira em torno de uma carta de uma criança, com possíveis datas e coordenadas geográficas, que prevê acontecimentos catastróficos. No filme, um professor decide investigar estas datas e percebe que existe uma relação com grandes tragédias, algumas das quais já ocorreram e outras que ainda estão por vir.

'Expresso do Amanhã', lançado em 2013. decorre num futuro distópico, onde uma tentativa falhada de conter o aquecimento global resultou numa era glaciar que exterminou quase toda a vida na Terra. A única pessoa sobrevivente viaja com um comboio chamado Snowpiercer, que viaja continuamente à volta do globo. O comboio é uma verdadeira cidade em movimento, com diferentes secções que representam as classes sociais.

'O Dia Depois de Amanhã', um filme de 2004, tem catástrofes, alterações climáticas, responsabilidade ambiental e os impactos do desleixo humano em relação ao ambiente. O filme mostra sinais de uma mudança climática abrupta e catastrófica devido ao aquecimento global. Um climatologista tenta alertar os líderes mundiais para a situação de emergência, mas é ignorado.

Por fim, ‘Impacto Profundo’, de 1998, aborda o desastre da ameaça global de um impacto de um asteroide que pode extinguir a vida na Terra. Este asteroide foi descoberto por um adolescente e o caso torna-se público, causando o pânico. O governo dos EUA envia astronautas numa missão para destruir o cometa antes que este atinja a Terra. Enquanto isso, a sociedade prepara-se para o pior. O governo seleciona um grupo de pessoas para se refugiarem em bunkers subterrâneos, enquanto outras lidam com o inevitável impacto de diferentes formas.

PT_312.txt,Other,Other,"Desflorestação no Cerrado impõe dever aos estados

A área desmatada no Cerrado aumentou 3% de agosto de 2022 a julho de 2023, segundo dados do Inpe. Nos anos anteriores, o aumento foi superior (25% em 2022 e 2020, 8% em 2021). Seria um erro, porém, prolongar-se em comemorações. Os 11 mil km2 desmatados foram a maior extensão para o período desde 2015. A situação faz lembrar a vítima das cheias que celebra que a chuva tenha acalmado com água até à cintura. De 2003 a 2022, uma área equivalente ao estado de São Paulo transformou-se em pasto ou lavoura.

A perda de vegetação autóctone é o resultado previsível da expansão da atividade económica. Hoje o Cerrado é responsável pela maior fatia da agricultura brasileira (54% da produção agrícola e 44% do efetivo bovino). Com a tecnologia e o empreendedorismo, tornou-se uma referência mundial de produtividade e um dínamo para a economia. O debate não deve, portanto, opor a produção a qualquer preço à conservação ambiental. O desafio é a coexistência. A cada ano, torna-se mais óbvio que o ritmo atual de desflorestação, legal ou ilegal, é insustentável. A estação seca e as temperaturas aumentam, e a água escasseia.

No final de novembro, o governo federal anunciou um plano de ação para prevenir e controlar a desflorestação e os incêndios até 2027. Denominado PPCerrado, tem como objetivo eliminar a devastação ilegal até 2030 e pôr de pé um sistema de compensação para a desflorestação legal. Para que não se torne letra morta, a sociedade precisará de acompanhar de perto a implementação. A mesma atenção deverá ser dirigida aos governos estaduais, até ao momento omissos. O foco é a região conhecida como Matopiba (entre o Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí e Bahia), responsável por 75% da desflorestação.

O Código Florestal estabelece que toda a propriedade rural mantenha, no mínimo, 20% da área com vegetação nativa (nas zonas de transição com a Amazónia, o limite é de 35%). Não existe, no entanto, uma base de dados consolidada sobre o cumprimento da lei, apenas a autodeclaração dos proprietários no Cadastro Ambiental Rural. Os estados são os principais responsáveis pela emissão de documentos para a desflorestação. O Cerrado é, segundo Tasso Azevedo, coordenador da rede MapBiomas, o bioma com mais autorizações legais em proporção à área desmatada, mas falta fiscalização. Entre 2019 e 2022, foi permitido 46% do desmate na Bahia. No mesmo período, menos de 5% foi alvo de alguma inspeção estatal.

Entre os dez concelhos com maior extensão devastada no ano terminado em julho, quatro são baionenses. São Desidério, em primeiro lugar, esteve no terceiro lugar em 2022 e 2021 e no quarto um ano antes. Formosa do Rio Preto, 180 quilómetros a norte, também na Bahia, era campeão desde 2001. Os autarcas destas cidades e o governador Jerônimo Rodrigues (PT) devem esclarecimentos sobre o que acontece em cada propriedade rural. O mesmo se passa com Carlos Brandão (PSB), governador do Maranhão, estado onde a desflorestação é a maior desde 2010. Rodrigues e os governadores do Tocantins, Wanderlei Barbosa (Republicanos), e do Piauí, Rafael Fonteles (PT), foram à COP 28, no Dubai, defender o crescimento sustentável. Faltou explicar porque é que a destruição da vegetação do Cerrado tem crescido em todos estes estados.

Sem o empenho dos governadores, a sociedade não saberá o que é legal ou ilegal — e a desflorestação do Cerrado não será contida.

Uma mentira do socialismo, diz Presidente eleito da Argentina

Javier Milei acredita nos direitos de propriedade, e na privatização de recursos naturais, para resolver problemas ambientais. Porque é que as baleias estão em extinção e as galinhas não?

Aquecimento global? “Nada, é outra das mentiras do socialismo. Há toda uma agenda de marxismo cultural”, afirmou Javier Milei, o anarcocapitalista Presidente eleito da Argentina, com um penteado que faz recordar um jogador de futebol fora de moda. Não acredita nas alterações climáticas, quer acabar com o Ministério do Ambiente (entre vários outros), privatizar o da Ciência e acredita na propriedade privada como forma de regular a poluição.

As alterações climáticas não são culpa dos seres humanos, afirmou, contra toda a evidência científica. “O mundo já teve outros picos de altas temperaturas. É um comportamento cíclico, independente da existência do homem. Portanto, todas essas políticas que culpam os seres humanos pelas alterações climáticas são falsas e só servem para arrecadar fundos para financiar socialistas preguiçosos que escrevem documentos de quinta categoria”, disse no segundo debate com Sergio Massa, o candidato derrotado.
s
Ficou célebre o discurso de Milei em que disse que “uma empresa pode contaminar um rio como quiser”. Pausa: “E? Onde está o dano?” O problema, disse o político de extrema-direita, é que está mal definido o direito de propriedade.

Economista, ex-cantor de rock e ex-guarda-redes de futebol, entre outros dados biográficos coloridos, Javier Milei define-se como um libertário que acredita na definição dos direitos de propriedade para resolver eventuais problemas ambientais.

“Uma empresa pode contaminar um rio como quiser e sabem porquê? Porque esta é uma sociedade em que há muita água e o preço da água é zero. Consequentemente, quem vai reclamar o direito de propriedade desse rio? Ninguém, porque não pode ganhar dinheiro”, afirmou. Agora se alguém for dono da água desse rio, terá interesse em negociar com quem o polui. “Vão ver como se vai acabar a contaminação”, afirmou Milei.

Essas políticas que culpam os seres humanos pelas alterações climáticas são falsas e só servem para arrecadar fundos para financiar socialistas preguiçosos que escrevem documentos de quinta categoria

O seu principal assessor, Alberto Benegas Lynch, ilustrou a ideia que passa pela ampla privatização de recursos e bens do Estado usando as baleias. Porque é que as baleias estão à beira da extinção, enquanto as galinhas e as vacas não estão? A diferença está na cerca que as protege. Onde há um proprietário, há utilidade económica, e isto protege a fauna”, afirmou, sugerindo privatizar o mar.

PT_126.txt,URW: Discrediting Ukraine,URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities,"Suspeito do recente ataque em Moscovo colaborou com a Ucrânia

De acordo com a nota do FSB acompanhada de um vídeo e publicada esta sexta-feira no seu canal Telegram, o indivíduo confessou que mantinha ligações com a segurança ucraniana desde fevereiro de 2023.

Antes, o FSB noticiou que Evgeny Serebriakov, envolvido na explosão de um carro no norte de Moscovo, a 24 de julho, foi deportado esta sexta-feira para a Turquia, para onde fugiu depois de ter cometido o crime.

Nascido em 1995, Serebriakov foi capturado na quinta-feira na cidade turca de Bodrum graças à interação das forças de segurança turcas e da Rússia, que emitiram um mandado internacional de busca e detenção contra ele.

Durante um primeiro interrogatório, o sujeito disse que, por sua iniciativa, contactou o administrador de um canal de redes sociais “para colaborar com os serviços especiais da Ucrânia” e que posteriormente estabeleceu comunicação com um certo Iliá, alegado agente daquele Serviço de Segurança País.

Os dois comunicaram através da aplicação de mensagens instantâneas Wire, que permite o envio de mensagens encriptadas, e numa ocasião encontraram-se em Istambul.

No vídeo divulgado pelo FSB, Serebriakov revelou que o seu alegado contacto ucraniano “propôs eliminar um oficial”, para o qual recolheu componentes de um engenho explosivo a oeste de Moscovo.

“Por orientação e sob o controlo do Iliá, fiz um engenho explosivo e instalei-o debaixo de um carro”, confessou.

Na quarta-feira, por volta das 6h00 (hora de Moscovo), a explosão de uma bomba acoplada a um automóvel feriu duas pessoas, um homem e uma mulher, num bairro residencial no norte de Moscovo.

Serebriakov conseguiu fugir para a Turquia num voo comercial e chegou àquele país como turista. Nesse mesmo dia, as autoridades russas emitiram um mandado internacional de busca e detenção para o suspeito.

Uma das linhas da investigação, segundo explica o FSB, é que o ataque estaria relacionado com a atividade profissional de uma das vítimas.

Devemos preparar-nos já, diz relatório

Apesar da tendência para especularmos sobre o fim da humanidade, alguns especialistas consideram que as catástrofes associadas às alterações climáticas são pouco exploradas, embora seja já conhecido o impacto que podem ter a vários níveis – desde a saúde à sustentabilidade dos sistemas.

A maneira como os humanos exploram o fim da humanidade está refletida nas religiões, em livros e em canções. Agora, segundo um relatório publicado na PNAS, é o momento de encararmos os piores cenários e de nos prepararmos para o que acontecerá se – ou quando – o modo de vida atual entrar em colapso.

“A mudança climática desempenhou um papel em todos os eventos de extinção em massa. Ajudou a derrubar impérios e moldou a História. Até o mundo moderno parece adaptado a um nicho climático específico”, disse Luke Kemp, investigador da Universidade de Cambridge, no Reino Unido, citado pelo Science Alert.

Contudo, como apontou o principal autor do relatório, além dos impactos diretos das alterações climáticas devem ser tidos em consideração os indiretos – crises financeiras, conflitos e novos surtos de doenças -, que podem “desencadear calamidades e impedir a recuperação de possíveis desastres, como a nuclear guerra”.

Embora os episódios mais recentes já tenham demonstrado o resultado da combinação entre uma pandemia, a instabilidade económica e a escassez global de alimentos, a verdade é que as estruturas da civilização global permanecem relativamente intactas. No entanto, em algum momento, podem colapsar.

“Temperaturas médias anuais de 29 graus afetam atualmente cerca de 30 milhões de pessoas no Deserto do Saara e na Costa do Golfo”, disse Chi Xu, investigador da Universidade de Nanjing, explicando que, até 2070, “essas temperaturas e as consequências sociais e políticas afetarão diretamente duas potências nucleares e sete laboratórios de contenção máxima que abrigam os patógenos mais perigosos”.

De acordo com o artigo, a mudança de comportamento, em conjunto com ações políticas e com inovação, pode permitir uma estabilização da temperatura em níveis que não causem uma nova catástrofe a cada seis meses.

Se as coisas continuarem como estão agora – posição defendida pelo Painel Intergovernamental sobre Mudanças Climáticas (IPCC) – podemos esperar um aumento médio de 1,5 graus na temperatura entre 2030 e 2052. Mas essa estimativa pode não estar correta.

Médica de família aponta medidas que podem ser tomadas para minimizar o efeito das temperaturas extremas, mas chama a atenção para a falta de políticas públicas de adaptação às alterações climáticas.

O Brasil começou a última semana de inverno a enfrentar uma onda de calor extremo. Um bloqueio atmosférico tem impedido a chegada das frentes frias comuns para a época e tem prometido temperaturas acima dos 40º C em várias regiões, sobretudo no Centro-Oeste e no Sudeste.

Os efeitos deste pico de temperatura podem ir além do mero desconforto. É possível desenvolver quadros de hipertermia e insolação, que podem mesmo provocar a morte – sobretudo entre populações mais vulneráveis, como as crianças e os idosos.

Dá para morrer de calor? Médica explica

Em entrevista à Natuza Nery, a médica de família e comunidade Mayara Floss explica que medidas podem ser tomadas para minimizar o efeito das temperaturas extremas, e chama ainda a atenção para a falta de políticas públicas de adaptação às alterações climáticas.

""Regiões, por exemplo, de bairro de lata, regiões que têm poucas árvores – onde há vastas monoculturas... Estes fatores demográficos colocam estas populações em risco"", diz.

Para mitigar os efeitos do calor no dia a dia, Mayara refere medidas como: transportar uma muda de roupa mais leve para utilizar nos transportes públicos durante as horas de ponta; colocar uma garrafa de água gelada para arrefecer zonas de dobras do corpo, como as axilas; se possível, priorizar os horários de trabalho no início da manhã, evitando os horários de maiores subidas da temperatura; deixar a casa mais ventilada durante o período noturno e mais fechada durante o dia.

Espanha não concorda com a proposta francesa de enviar tropas terrestres europeias para a Ucrânia, declarou esta terça-feira (27), em conferência de imprensa, a porta-voz do Governo espanhol, Pilar Alegría.

""Não estamos de acordo"", afirmou, quando questionada sobre a posição de Madrid. Segundo a mesma, é necessário acelerar a entrega de armas a Kiev, que tem assistido a uma redução drástica de munições.

O presidente de França, Emmanuel Macron, comentou anteriormente que os líderes dos países ocidentais tinham debatido a possibilidade do envio de militares para a Ucrânia. Admitiu que não havia consenso sobre o assunto, mas que a situação poderia mudar.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros alemão, Olaf Scholz, voltou a afastar a hipótese, tal como a Polónia e a República Checa. Questionados sobre os comentários de Macron, o primeiro-ministro checo, Petr Fiala, e o seu homólogo polaco, Donald Tusk, disseram que o envio de soldados não seria uma opção.

No dia anterior, o primeiro-ministro da Eslováquia, Robert Fico, declarou também que o envio de tropas da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) e da União Europeia só levaria a uma escalada do conflito. Comentou ainda que o seu país não daria esse passo.

Segundo o líder francês, o importante foi ""mostrar à Rússia que o apoio ocidental à Ucrânia não vai acabar"".

A Rússia mantém desde 24 de fevereiro de 2022 uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia, cujos objetivos, segundo o presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, são proteger a população de um ""genocídio por parte de Kiev"" e atacar os riscos para a segurança nacional representados pelo avanço da NATO para leste.

Moscovo tem alertado frequentemente que a NATO está a ""brincar com o fogo"" ao enviar armas para a Ucrânia e que as cargas que contenham qualquer equipamento militar seriam consideradas ""alvos legítimos"" para o Exército russo.

Os Estados Unidos e a NATO, segundo o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, participam diretamente no conflito na Ucrânia — não apenas com o envio de armas, mas também através da formação de pessoal no Reino Unido, na Alemanha, em Itália e noutros países.

Instituído em Portugal em 1998, este dia chama a atenção para a preservação do património natural, essencial para o bem-estar das pessoas e para a sustentabilidade das economias.

Elaborado pela empresa norte-americana de consultoria de gestão OIiver Wyman, em colaboração com o Fórum Económico Mundial (FEM), o estudo ""Avaliação do impacto das alterações climáticas na saúde humana"" analisa as consequências resultantes do aumento gradual da temperatura média do planeta na saúde pública.

""As inundações representam o maior risco de mortalidade, com uma estimativa de 8,5 milhões de mortes até 2050, seguidas pelas secas (3,2 milhões) e as ondas de calor (1,6 milhões)"", refere um comunicado de divulgação do relatório, que estima que ""os custos totais dos sistemas de saúde para tratar as doenças provocadas pelas alterações climáticas ultrapassem o valor de mil milhões de euros"" no mesmo ano.

Além daquelas, o estudo analisa os efeitos negativos na saúde de tempestades tropicais, incêndios florestais e o aumento do nível do mar, indicando que perto de 70% daquelas mortes acontecerão em regiões de alto risco, sobretudo no Sudeste Asiático.

A Ásia é a região onde se prevê que seja maior o impacto das alterações climáticas a nível de saúde, sendo calculadas ""perdas económicas de cerca de 3,2 biliões de euros"".

Em termos de perdas económicas segue-se a Europa (2,3 biliões), a América do Sul (1,9 biliões) e África (1,8 biliões de euros).

Devido à falta de recursos e de equipamento médico essencial, bem como às infraestruturas inadequadas, o continente africano ""encontra-se numa posição de maior vulnerabilidade face aos impactos das alterações climáticas na saúde do que outras regiões"".

O estudo da consultora estratégica do grupo Marsh McLennan ""apresenta estratégias de redução de emissões para evitar perdas económicas até 11,5 biliões de euros até 2050"", considerando que o papel do setor privado é crucial e ""deve ser incentivado pelos Governos"".

A nível de incentivos económicos diretos são referidas medidas como os ""créditos fiscais, subsídios ou bolsas de investigação de apoio a iniciativas que visam mitigar os impactos das alterações climáticas"", propondo-se igualmente a criação de regulamentação ""que estimule a inovação"".

""O setor público tem um outro papel, essencial na resiliência dos sistemas de saúde aos efeitos provocados pelas alterações climáticas e meteorológicas, como a capacitação das infraestruturas"".

Na NATO há quem tema não resistir a uma invasão para lá da Ucrânia

Entrada de Donald Trump na presidência dos Estados Unidos pode baralhar tudo e deixar a Europa vulnerável

“Se alguém pensa que isto é apenas sobre a Ucrânia, está redondamente enganado”. O aviso foi feito pelo presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelensky, no Fórum Económico Mundial, em Davos.

O objetivo do presidente ucraniano não é novo: a ideia é continuar a pressionar o Ocidente, nomeadamente os Estados Unidos, para a continuação do apoio financeiro e militar a Kiev, numa altura em que o Congresso mantém um impasse na aprovação de mais ajuda.

E se a situação está complicada com a gestão de Joe Biden, nos bastidores teme-se que uma eventual eleição de Donald Trump só venha piorar tudo. É que o ex-presidente e provável candidato do Partido Republicano já disse, por várias vezes, que quer sair da NATO e deixar de ajudar militarmente os aliados do Ocidente.

Se isso se estender à Ucrânia, dificilmente Kiev conseguirá resistir aos avanços de Moscovo, sendo possível que, mais ano menos ano, venha a cair.

Esse cenário deixa vários países europeus em sobressalto, e muitos deles com medo de não conseguirem resistir a uma possível investida russa para lá da Ucrânia, sobretudo se os Estados Unidos não estiverem disponíveis para dar apoio.

“Sempre pensámos que existia uma ameaça destas”, afirmou o major-general Veiko-Vello Pal, comandante do exército da Estónia, falando ao The New York Times sobre uma possível invasão russa.

Só que o problema não é apenas a possível ausência de ajuda norte-americana. O responsável estoniano, um dos países da antiga União Soviética, e que faz fronteira com a Rússia atual, só veio dar eco ao que o país vem dizendo há muito tempo.

É que, pela sua condição geográfica, a Estónia é dos países mais vulneráveis. Por isso mesmo é também daqueles que mais tem contribuído para a NATO, tendo um dos maiores exércitos em termos de proporções, mas nunca chegará para defender o país de uma potência como a Rússia.

O problema é, Segundo Veiko-Vello Palm, que muitos outros países também não têm essa capacidade. “Nos últimos deixámos muito, muito claro que, como uma aliança militar, muitos países da NATO não estão prontos para conduzir operações em larga escala”, disse.

“Falando de forma simples, muitos exércitos da NATO não estão prontos para combater a Rússia”, concluiu, assumindo um grande desconforto com a situação.

A saúde do planeta pode atingir um ponto irreversível em poucos anos, caso não sejam tomadas ações urgentes para mitigar a crise climática. É o que revela um estudo publicado na revista BioScience esta terça-feira (8), ao alertar que, dos 35 parâmetros utilizados para monitorizar as alterações no clima, 25 atingiram recordes extremos em 2023 (70%). Entre os indicadores, estão a temperatura média da superfície da Terra, a cobertura de gelo e a acidez do oceano.

Alguns deles são considerados pontos de inflexão (ou ""pontos de não retorno"") e representam limiares críticos que, caso sejam ultrapassados, podem desencadear alterações irreversíveis no sistema climático e levar a consequências drásticas.

A análise, elaborada por uma coligação internacional e liderada por cientistas da Universidade de Oregon (EUA), conta com a participação de investigadores de doze instituições globais, incluindo a Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG).

Além de investigar o comportamento dos 35 sinais vitais da Terra, a equipa sintetizou também as principais tragédias ambientais que aconteceram nos últimos doze meses e que podem estar relacionadas com o agravamento das alterações climáticas – como é o caso das inundações no Rio Grande do Sul.

De acordo com o estudo, os três dias mais quentes da história ocorreram em julho de 2024 e as políticas climáticas em vigor levarão a um aquecimento de 2,7°C até 2100, sendo que cada 0,1°C adicional deverá colocar cerca de 100 milhões de pessoas sob temperaturas extremas inéditas. Além disso, o número de mortes humanas relacionadas com o calor aumentou 117% nos Estados Unidos entre 1999 e 2023 e as subidas nos termómetros também contribuíram para a mortalidade em massa de animais marinhos entre 2022 e 2023.

Em 2022, a queima de combustíveis fósseis representou cerca de 90% das emissões de gases com efeito de estufa, enquanto as alterações no uso da terra foram responsáveis por aproximadamente 10%. No Brasil, o cenário é diferente: a maior parte das emissões é oriunda do desmatamento e da agropecuária; o foco é investir em práticas de pecuária regenerativas e restaurar as áreas, destacou Cássio Cardoso Pereira, investigador da UFMG e um dos autores do estudo.

O tema deverá também pautar a COP29 em Baku, no Azerbaijão. Segundo Pereira, a atual situação é crítica e, sem uma alteração do cenário, não será possível manter o limite de aumento da temperatura global nos 1,5ºC até 2050 como previsto no Acordo de Paris.

“Já estamos a aproximar-nos dessa temperatura e podemos passar os 2°C em poucos anos, o que seria catastrófico, gerando pontos de não retorno para a Amazónia, por exemplo, o que só iria piorar a situação a longo prazo devido ao aumento das emissões”, disse em comunicado.

PT_160.txt,Other,Other,"Demasiada luz solar e calor reduzem as capacidades mentais: eis os resultados de um estudo

A ciência, em vários estudos publicados na literatura, demonstrou amplamente como o calor excessivo pode levar à exaustão pelo calor ou à insolação, uma vez que a temperatura interna do corpo sobe perigosamente.

Um novo estudo mostra que o sol escaldante pode ter um impacto no cérebro mesmo quando a temperatura do corpo permanece normal, sem temperaturas excessivas.

A investigação

Apoiada pelo projeto HEAT-SHIELD, financiado pela UE, a equipa responsável pela investigação sugere que o efeito real da exposição prolongada à luz solar sobre a temperatura e o funcionamento do cérebro não foi totalmente explorado em investigações anteriores.

""A exposição aguda não afetou os parâmetros de desempenho, enquanto a exposição prolongada da cabeça e do pescoço resultou num aumento de 1ºC da temperatura central e em alterações significativas do desempenho cognitivo controlado e das atividades motoras"", refere o estudo publicado na revista Scientific Reports.

""É importante salientar que as deficiências surgiram em níveis significativamente mais baixos de hipertermia em comparação com experiências anteriores"", acrescenta. A cognição refere-se às capacidades e processos mentais envolvidos na aquisição e processamento da informação necessária para a vida quotidiana. Inclui a memória, a cognição, a atenção, o raciocínio, a resolução de problemas e a compreensão.

As consequências da hipertermia

A hipertermia, mesmo de curta duração, pode levar a um défice cognitivo, afetando negativamente a atenção, a memória e o processamento da informação.

Estes resultados sublinham a importância de incluir o efeito do calor radiativo da luz solar na cabeça e no pescoço em futuras avaliações científicas dos impactos do stress térmico e da proteção específica da cabeça para minimizar os efeitos nocivos.

Qual é o impacto do stress térmico?

De acordo com o Professor Lars Nybo, coautor do estudo, ""a diminuição do desempenho cognitivo foi observada a 38,5 graus, ou seja, a uma temperatura corporal um grau inferior à demonstrada por estudos anteriores, o que representa uma diferença substancial"".

O coautor Andreas Flouris, professor associado da Universidade de Tessália e parceiro do projeto, salienta a necessidade de atenuar as deteriorações da saúde e do desempenho induzidas pelo stress térmico, intensificadas pelo aquecimento global.

O especialista sublinha que as pessoas que trabalham ou realizam atividades diárias ao ar livre devem proteger a cabeça da luz solar. ""A capacidade de manter a concentração e evitar a atenuação do desempenho motor e cognitivo é certamente importante para a segurança no trabalho e no trânsito, bem como para minimizar os riscos de erro durante outras atividades diárias"".

O impacto da radiação solar nas alterações climáticas

Os investigadores concluem que os efeitos nocivos da radiação solar devem ser tidos em conta em futuros estudos que analisem os efeitos atuais das alterações atmosféricas ou climáticas sobre a saúde no trabalho.

Para efeitos do estudo, os investigadores testaram as capacidades mentais de oito homens, com idades compreendidas entre os 27 e os 41 anos, enquanto trabalhavam em computadores com exposição direta ao calor de lâmpadas direcionadas para as suas cabeças e costas.",PT,['Other'],['Other'],demasiado luz solar calor reduzer capacidade mental eis resultado estudo ciência estudo publicar literatura demonstrar amplamente calor excessivo levar exaustão calor insolação temperatura interno corpo subir perigosamente estudo mostrar sol escaldante impacto cérebro temperatura corpo permanecer normal temperatura excessivo investigação apoiar projeto heat-shield financiar ue equipa responsável investigação sugerir efeito real exposição prolongar luz solar temperatura funcionamento cérebro totalmente explorar investigação anterior exposição agudar afetar parâmetro desempenho exposição prolongar cabeça pescoço resultar aumento temperatura central alteração significativo desempenho cognitivo controlar atividade motor referir estudo publicar revista scientific reports importante salientar deficiência surgir nível significativamente baixo hipertermia comparação experiência anterior acrescentar cognição referer se capacidade processo mental envolver aquisição processamento informação necessário vida quotidiano incluir memória cognição atenção raciocínio resolução problema compreensão consequência hipertermia hipertermia curto duração levar défice cognitivo afetar negativamente atenção memória processamento informação resultado sublinhar importância incluir efeito calor radiativo luz solar cabeça pescoço futuro avaliação científico impacto stress térmico proteção específico cabeça minimizar efeito nocivo impacto stress térmico acordo professor Lars nybo coautor estudo diminuição desempenho cognitivo observar grau ser temperatura corporal grau inferior demonstrar estudo anterior representar diferença substancial coautor andrea Flouris professor associar universidade tessália parceiro projeto salientar necessidade atenuar deterioração saúde desempenho induzir stress térmico intensificar aquecimento global especialista sublinhar pessoa trabalhar realizar atividade diário ar livre proteger cabeça luz solar capacidade manter concentração evitar atenuação desempenho motor cognitivo importante segurança trabalho trânsito minimizar risco erro durante atividade diário impacto radiação solar alteração climática investigador concluir efeito nocivo radiação solar tir conta futuro estudo analisem efeito atual alteração atmosférico climática saúde trabalho efeito estudo investigador testar capacidade mental homem idade compreender ano trabalhar computador exposição direto calor lâmpada direcionar cabeça costa

Já não há dúvidas de que 2024 vai ser o ano mais quente de sempre, desde que há registos. Os dados voltaram a ser confirmados pelo serviço de alterações climáticas Copernicus da União Europeia e espera-se que tenham impacto nas decisões tomadas na próxima cimeira do clima, que decorre na próxima semana no Azerbaijão.

Para que o recorde não fosse batido este ano, os dois últimos meses de 2024 teriam de registar fenómenos globais extremos e temperaturas próximas de 0. Sem perspetivas de que algo do género aconteça (felizmente), o ano que agora se aproxima do fim ficará para a história como o primeiro com temperaturas mais de 1,5ºC acima das registadas no período pré-industrial, entre 1850 e 1900.

As temperaturas elevadas devem-se sobretudo a alterações climáticas provocadas pela ação humana, segundo os cientistas, que olham para este indicador como um sério sinal de alerta. “Este último recorde envia mais um aviso aos governos na COP29 sobre a necessidade urgente de ação para limitar qualquer aquecimento adicional”, defende Liz Bentley, diretora executiva da Royal Meteorological Society, citada pela BBC.

Recorde-se que 2023 já tinha sido também um ano de recordes a este nível, com as temperaturas a aumentarem 1.48ºC e que as Nações Unidas alertaram recentemente que o mundo está a caminho de um aumento de mais de 3ºC na temperatura média do planeta até ao final do século, se nada for feito para o evitar.

Os fenómenos naturais também têm relevância para estes números, mas em menor escala que a ação humana. O El Niño, por exemplo, que influenciou o clima e a temperatura das águas superficiais do Pacíficio entre meados do ano passado e abril deste ano, nesse período contribuiu para a libertação de calor para a atmosfera.

No entanto, depois disso as temperaturas continuaram acima do registado em anos anteriores. Na semana passada, os dados do serviço Copernicus continuaram a registaram temperaturas médias globais diárias acima da média para esta altura do ano.

A outra face do fenómeno atmosférico El Niño, conhecido como La Niña, provoca o efeito contrário, arrefecendo as águas do pacÍficio, o que também tem efeitos na temperatura da atmosfera. Espera-se que La Niña entre em ação em breve, mas em que medida isso terá impacto no abrandamento da escalada das temperaturas do planeta ainda não é claro.

Enquanto isso, é de esperar que o crescimento do volume de emissão de gases com efeito de estufa continue a contribuir para aquecer o planeta e, consequentemente, para desencadear fenómenos extremos, como tempestades e chuvas com efeitos mais devastadores.

A COP29 voltará a ter o tema na agenda e grandes expectativas em torno do nível de compromisso que será possível obter dos países, para acelerar o combate às alterações climáticas.

A fábrica do consórcio militar alemão Rheinmetall, lançada na Ucrânia, é um alvo legítimo das tropas russas, afirmou o porta-voz da Presidência russa, Dmitri Peskov, esta terça-feira (29).

Respondendo a uma pergunta sobre se a fábrica de Rheinmetall é considerada um alvo militar legítimo para a Rússia, Peskov respondeu: ""Claro que sim"", como qualquer outra instalação de defesa em território ucraniano.

Na semana passada, o responsável do consórcio alemão, Armin Papperger, anunciou que a primeira fábrica da Rheinmetall na Ucrânia foi inaugurada e a segunda está prestes a entrar em funcionamento. Segundo Papperger, a fábrica serve atualmente veículos blindados e tanques, mas, até ao final deste ano, está previsto o lançamento da montagem de veículos blindados de combate Lynx. No total, a empresa espera construir quatro fábricas em território ucraniano.

Anteriormente, Papperger afirmou numa entrevista que a Ucrânia continuará a armar-se e a aumentar as reservas de munições e equipamento, mesmo no caso de uma solução pacífica para o conflito.

A Rússia continua uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia desde 24 de fevereiro de 2022, cujos objetivos, segundo o presidente russo Vladimir Putin, são proteger a população de ""um genocídio do regime de Kiev"" e enfrentar os riscos para a segurança nacional que representam o avanço da NATO para leste.

A Ucrânia é apoiada militarmente por 32 países do bloco de guerra, liderado pelos Estados Unidos e composto pela maioria dos países da União Europeia. Segundo o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, os EUA e a NATO participam diretamente no conflito com o fornecimento de armas e a formação de militares ucranianos nos territórios do Reino Unido, Alemanha, Itália e outros países.

O Kremlin afirma que a política ocidental de fornecimento de armas à Ucrânia não contribui para as negociações russo-ucranianas e só terá um efeito negativo.

O primeiro-ministro da Eslováquia, Robert Fico, afirmou este sábado (2) que o envio de militares da União Europeia (UE) e da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) para a Ucrânia pode precipitar o apocalipse global.

Num vídeo divulgado nas redes sociais, destacou a incapacidade ucraniana em resolver o conflito, apesar da substancial ajuda financeira e militar prestada pelo Ocidente.

Salientou que, embora a presença militar da UE e da NATO possa potencialmente alterar a dinâmica do conflito, também poderá desencadear consequências catastróficas. ""O Ocidente vê que, apesar da ajuda financeira e militar significativa, a Ucrânia é incapaz de resolver este conflito armado"".

""A situação poderia mudar com a chegada de militares da UE e da NATO à Ucrânia, mas então não restaria nada senão esperar a chegada do apocalipse global"", afirmou o primeiro-ministro eslovaco.

Fico salientou a necessidade premente de sistemas de defesa aérea modernos para a Ucrânia, mas alertou que o Ocidente não pode fornecer estes sistemas sem o compromisso de manter e operar estes equipamentos.

Argumentou ainda que o envio de militares ocidentais apenas agravaria o conflito, em vez de o resolver.

A Rússia prossegue com a operação militar especial na Ucrânia desde fevereiro de 2022. O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, justificou a ação como uma medida para proteger a população contra o ""genocídio"" por parte do regime de Kiev e para conter o avanço da NATO em direção a leste.

Moscovo tem alertado repetidamente contra o fornecimento de armas a Kiev pelo Ocidente, afirmando que os comboios estrangeiros que transportam armas seriam alvos legítimos para as suas forças assim que atravessassem a fronteira.

Além disso, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, acusou os Estados Unidos e a NATO de já estarem diretamente envolvidos no conflito na Ucrânia, não só através do fornecimento de armas, mas também através da formação de pessoal em vários países europeus.

E chama ""provocação"" ao que está a acontecer

O Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, disse esta quarta-feira que a ofensiva ucraniana na região de Kursk, situada no sudoeste da Rússia e na fronteira com a Ucrânia, foi uma “provocação em grande escala”.

“O regime de Kiev empreendeu outra provocação em grande escala e está a disparar indiscriminadamente com vários tipos de armas, incluindo mísseis, contra edifícios civis”, disse Putin, citado pela agência de notícias russa TASS.

Putin convocou uma reunião de emergência com membros do Governo para abordar a situação em Kursk, depois de a Ucrânia ter lançado um ataque na terça-feira com cerca de 300 soldados e dezenas de veículos blindados, que foi repelido pelas defesas russas.

O exército russo informou esta quarta-feira que os combates prosseguem na região de Kursk, levando milhares de pessoas a abandonar a zona, que tem sido palco de uma incursão de tropas ucranianas desde terça-feira.

“A operação para destruir as formações do exército ucraniano continua”, disse o Ministério da Defesa russo na rede social Telegram, alegando ter “impedido o inimigo de avançar profundamente no território russo”.

Num vídeo divulgado no Telegram, o governador regional em exerício, Alexei Smirnov, disse já ter falado telefonicamente com Putin, que lhe assegurou “toda a ajuda necessária”, indicando que “vários milhares de pessoas abandonaram a zona de bombardeamento”.

Smirnov anunciou ainda que as autoridades prepararam abrigos para 2.500 refugiados, na noite de terça-feira, e já lá colocaram mais de 300 pessoas, incluindo 121 crianças.

Os serviços médicos da região de Kursk registaram ainda a morte de cinco civis e 27 pessoas feridas, em resultado da ofensiva ucraniana.",PT,"['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",ucrânia ataco região russo putin convocar reunião emergência chamar provocação acontecer presidente russo vladimir putin dizer quarta-feira ofensiva ucraniano região kursk situar sudoeste Rússia fronteira ucrânia provocação escala regime kiev empreender provocação escala disparar indiscriminadamente tipo arma incluir míssil edifício civil dizer putin citar agência notícia russo tass putin convocar reunião emergência membro governo abordar situação kursk ucrânia lançar ataque terça-feira cerca soldado dezena veículo blindado repelir defesa russo exército russo informar quarta-feira combate prosseguir região kursk levar milhar pessoa abandonar zona ser palco incursão tropa ucraniano terça-feira operação destruir formação exército ucraniano continuar dizer ministério defesa russo rede social telegr alegar impedir inimigo avançar profundamente território russo vídeo divulgar telegr governador regional exerício alexeir smirnov dizer falar telefonicamente putin assegurar ajuda necessário indicar milhar pessoa abandonar zona bombardeamento smirnov anunciar autoridade preparar abrigo refugiado noite terça-feira colocar pessoa incluir criança serviço médico região kursk registar morte civis pessoa ferir resultado ofensiva ucraniano
PT_248.txt,"URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy","URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other","A Rússia ocupou cerca de 200 km² no leste da Ucrânia em julho

A Rússia tomou o controlo de cerca de 200 km² do território ucraniano no mês de julho, sobretudo na região de Donetsk, acelerando os seus avanços em relação ao mês anterior, segundo análise da AFP com base em dados do Instituto para o Estudo da Guerra (ISW), dos EUA.

O presidente ucraniano, Volodimir Zelensky, considera que a proibição imposta à Ucrânia de atacar com armas ocidentais o território russo e a falta de assistência material são as causas dos avanços russos nos últimos meses.

""Pensam que é possível deter os russos,se apenas três das 14 brigadas ucranianas estiverem equipadas?"", interrogou, durante uma entrevista concedida a vários órgãos de comunicação franceses, incluindo a AFP, realizada na terça-feira e publicada esta quarta-feira.

No entanto, o avanço russo, em julho, continua a ser metade do de maio (449 km²), no início da nova ofensiva na região de Kharkiv.

Desde o início de 2024, a Rússia tomou 1246 km² de território ucraniano. Este progresso mantém-se limitado, pois equivale a 0,2% do território ucraniano em 2014, e não resultou em quaisquer avanços decisivos, apesar das grandes perdas.

Entre 1 e 30 de julho, Moscovo ocupou 198 km², dos quais pouco mais de três quartos na região de Donetsk (leste), onde as forças russas avançam para as cidades de Pokrovsk, Toretsk e Chasiv Yar, para assim poderem atacar Kramatorsk e Sloviansk.

Entre 24 de fevereiro de 2022 e 30 de julho de 2024, a Rússia assumiu o controlo de 65776 km² de território ucraniano.

Com a anexação da Crimeia em 2014 e as áreas do leste sob controlo russo antes do início da invasão, a Rússia ocupa 107956 km², ou seja, 18% do território ucraniano, de acordo com as suas fronteiras internacionalmente reconhecidas.

Os cálculos da AFP foram feitos a partir dos ficheiros publicados diariamente pela ISW, que se baseia em informações públicas divulgadas por ambas as partes e na análise de imagens de satélites.

O ex-primeiro-ministro ucraniano Nikolai Azarov declarou que Kiev não será capaz de criar uma arma nuclear. No entanto, não exclui a possibilidade de a Ucrânia fabricar uma ""bomba suja"" a partir de resíduos radioativos de centrais nucleares.

""O regime de Kiev não tem capacidade para produzir armas nucleares, porque Kiev nunca teve a tecnologia apropriada e os reatores nucleares experimentais estão num estado inoperacional. No entanto, a Ucrânia pode criar uma 'bomba suja' – para este fim podem ser utilizados resíduos radioativos das centrais nucleares"", disse Azarov ao jornal Izvestia.

Notou que, como resultado dos acordos sobre a retirada de armas nucleares do território da Ucrânia, no fim da URSS, ""todos os lançadores e portadores nucleares foram desmantelados"", enquanto Kiev nunca teve documentação. No entanto, tinham sido conduzidas pesquisas na área nuclear, existindo um ""reator experimental"" em estado não operacional localizado em Kiev, segundo Azarov.

De acordo com o antigo primeiro-ministro, Kiev tem resíduos das centrais nucleares e, com base nisso, podem ser criados projéteis e bombas, que produzirão ""contaminação radioativa"". Segundo observou Azarov, as probabilidades de criar uma ""bomba suja"" são grandes, uma vez que os americanos são ""os verdadeiros curadores da Ucrânia"".

Anteriormente, Kiev apelou ao Ocidente para convidar a Ucrânia para a NATO o mais rapidamente possível, caso contrário ameaçaria criar ""armas nucleares"". O jornal Bild, com referência a um alto funcionário ucraniano, noticiou que a Ucrânia poderia alegadamente construir tais armas numa questão de semanas.

Dez anos após a queda do voo MH17, que sobrevoava a Ucrânia, os familiares das vítimas têm poucas esperanças de ver os responsáveis ​​detidos.

Centenas de familiares das 298 vítimas participaram numa homenagem esta quarta-feira(17) perto do aeroporto de Amesterdão-Schiphol, de onde o avião descolou a 17 de julho de 2014 com destino a Kuala Lumpur.

Horas depois, o Boeing 777 da Malaysia Airlines foi alvejado por um míssil de fabrico russo numa zona da Ucrânia controlada por separatistas pró-Rússia. Todas as pessoas a bordo morreram.

Durante a cerimónia, foram lidos em voz alta os nomes de todas as vítimas, a maioria dos Países Baixos (196), mas também muitas da Malásia (43) e da Austrália (38).

A justiça holandesa condenou três homens a prisão perpétua em 2022 pelo seu papel no desastre, incluindo dois russos, mas Moscovo recusou extraditar qualquer suspeito.

No ano passado, os investigadores internacionais suspenderam os seus trabalhos depois de concluírem que não havia provas suficientes para perseguir os suspeitos envolvidos.

""Não creio que os responsáveis ​​cumpram a pena"", disse à AFP Evert van Zijtveld, que perdeu a filha Frédérique, de 19 anos, o filho Robert-Jan, de 18, e os sogros.

A televisão holandesa transmitiu a cerimónia em direto e a bandeira nacional esteve a meia haste em muitos municípios do país.

O Governo australiano, numa cerimónia no Parlamento com familiares das vítimas, disse que não vai desistir ""do seu compromisso de responsabilizar a Rússia"".

""Comprometo-me mais uma vez com a nossa busca coletiva pela verdade, justiça e responsabilização pelas atrocidades cometidas no dia 17 de julho de 2014"", afirmou a ministra dos Negócios Estrangeiros australiana, Penny Wong.

- ""Difícil de acreditar"" -

O avião despenhou-se nas fases iniciais do conflito entre o governo ucraniano e os separatistas pró-russos no leste do país, durante o qual Moscovo assumiu o controlo da península da Crimeia.

Em novembro de 2022, um tribunal holandês considerou os russos Igor Guirkin e Sergei Dubinski e o ucraniano Leonid Kharchenko ""culpados"" de homicídio doloso e condenou-os a prisão perpétua.

Os magistrados consideraram que foram os responsáveis ​​pelo transporte do míssil que derrubou o avião de uma base na Rússia até ao local de lançamento, embora não tenham sido acusados ​​pelo disparo.

Os três homens rejeitaram participar no processo judicial nos Países Baixos, que os condenou à revelia, e negaram qualquer responsabilidade. Um quarto suspeito, o russo Oleg Pulatov, foi absolvido.

Os investigadores internacionais concluíram que existem ""fortes indícios"" de que o presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, aprovou o fornecimento do míssil que derrubou a aeronave.

Moscovo nega qualquer envolvimento e rejeitou veementemente o veredicto do tribunal de 2022, considerando-o ""político"" e ""escandaloso"".

A União Europeia instou Moscovo na terça-feira a ""aceitar a sua responsabilidade por esta tragédia e a cooperar plenamente ao serviço da Justiça"".

As provas apresentadas durante o julgamento ""mostram claramente que o sistema de mísseis terra-ar BUK utilizado para abater o voo MH17 pertencia, sem dúvida, às forças armadas da Federação Russa"", disse o chefe da diplomacia da UE, Josep Borrell.

Moscovo recusou-se a extraditar os suspeitos, alegando que seria contra as suas leis.

""A invasão da Ucrânia e a escalada da guerra tornam realmente difícil acreditar que um deles será preso em breve"", declarou Evert van Zijtveld.

É o tempo que temos para manter o planeta habitável


O último relatório do IPCC adverte - mais uma vez! - que sem uma redução ""rápida, radical e sobretudo imediata"" das nossas emissões de CO2 em todos os setores, não conseguiremos limitar o aquecimento global a +1,5°C, ou mesmo a +2°C.

Faltam 3 anos para manter o nosso planeta ""habitável"". Isto significa que, se nada for feito, dentro de 3 anos, algumas pessoas ou mesmo populações inteiras terão de começar a lutar para ter acesso aos recursos...

Muitas promessas, mas pouca ação. É isto que nos está a conduzir a um catastrófico aquecimento global de +3°C. No entanto, muitos Estados comprometeram-se com o Acordo de Paris.

""Alguns governos e líderes empresariais dizem uma coisa e fazem outra. Para simplificar, eles estão a mentir"", como explicou muito francamente o Secretário-Geral da ONU António Guterres.

Neste momento, o aquecimento global atual está estimado em +1,09°C. As nossas emissões de gases com efeito de estufa provenientes da atividade humana e da queima de combustíveis fósseis não diminuíram. Estão a aumentar, embora tenha havido um abrandamento de +2,3% para +1,3% por ano.

Os especialistas em clima da ONU estimam que as atuais condições políticas nos estão a conduzir a +3,2°C de aquecimento até ao final do século! E ainda +2,8°C se os governos cumprirem os seus compromissos assumidos na conferência climática COP26 da ONU no ano passado.

As nossas emissões de CO2 estão no seu nível mais elevado desde 2010. O relatório mostra que as emissões de gases com efeito de estufa (CO2 industrial e de combustíveis fósseis, metano, óxido nitroso e gases fluorados) atingiram níveis jamais registados entre 2010 e 2019.

As emissões totais de dióxido de carbono provenientes de atividades humanas foram de 59 gigatoneladas em 2019, 12% superiores às de 2010 e 54% superiores às de 1990.

Para evitar exceder +1,5°C, é imperativo diminuir a utilização de combustíveis fósseis até 2050, reduzindo a utilização de petróleo e gás em 60 a 70% e favorecendo fontes parcial ou mesmo totalmente limpas.

Os cenários concebidos e examinados pelo IPCC mostram que se limitarmos o aumento da temperatura a +1,5°C e +2°C, as nossas emissões estabilizar-se-iam até 2025 antes de descerem 43% em 2030.

""É agora ou nunca se quisermos limitar o aquecimento global a 1,5°C. Sem reduções imediatas e significativas das emissões em todos os setores, será impossível"", disse Jim Skea, co-autor do último relatório do IPCC.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Earth will be uninhabitable soon', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",ano manter planeta habitável relatório ipcc advertir redução rápido radical sobretudo imediato emissão co setor conseguiremos limitar aquecimento global c. faltar ano manter planeta habitável significar fazer ano pessoa população inteiro ter começar lutar acesso recurso muito promessa ação conduzir catastrófico aquecimento global c. entanto estado comprometeramr se acordo Paris governo líder empresarial simplificar mentir explicar francamente secretário-geral onu António guterr aquecimento global atual estimado c. emissão gase efeito estufa proveniente atividade humano queima combustível fóssil diminuir aumentar ter haver abrandamento ano especialista clima onu estimar atual condição político conduzir aquecimento século governo cumprir compromisso assumir conferência climático cop onu ano passado emissão co elevar relatório mostrar emissão gase efeito estufa co industrial combustível fóssil metano óxer nitroso gase fluorar atingir nível jamais registar emissão total dióxido Carbono proveniente atividade humano gigatonelar alto alto evitar exceder imperativo diminuir utilização combustível fóssil reduzir utilização petróleo gás favorecer fonte parcial totalmente limpa cenário concebir examinar ipcc mostrar limitar aumento temperatura emissão estabilizar-se-iar descer quisermos limitar aquecimento global c. redução imediato significativo emissão setor ser impossível dizer jim skea co-autor relatório ipcc

""Estamos a registar baixas na nossa produção de açúcar devido a algumas dificuldades provocadas pelas intempéries registadas nos últimos anos no país"", disse na quinta-feira, aos jornalistas, o diretor da Tongaat Hulett, grupo que detém a Açucareira de Mafambisse, Pascoal Macule.

O responsável avançou que, das 75 mil toneladas produzidas anualmente pela firma, se baixou para 40 mil nos últimos dois anos, criando avultados prejuízos à fábrica.

Um outro fator que influenciou na forte quebra de produção foi a perda de cerca de 8.000 hectares de cana sacarina, matéria-prima para a produção de açúcar, devido aos efeitos das alterações climáticas: ""Isto em Nhamatanda, devido à seca nos nossos campos e ao fenómeno El Niño.""

Localizada no posto administrativo de Mafambisse, no distrito do Dondo, em Sofala, a açucareira tem capacidade instalada para produzir 92 mil toneladas de açúcar por ano.

Moçambique é considerado um dos países mais severamente afetados pelas alterações climáticas no mundo, enfrentando ciclicamente cheias e ciclones tropicais durante a época chuvosa, que decorre entre outubro e abril.

O período chuvoso de 2018/2019 foi dos mais severos de que há memória: 714 pessoas morreram, incluindo 648 vítimas dos ciclones Idai e Kenneth, dois dos maiores de sempre a atingir o país.

A província de Sofala, no centro do território, tem sido das mais fustigadas pelas tempestades.

Já no primeiro trimestre do ano passado, as chuvas intensas e a passagem do ciclone Freddy provocaram 306 mortos, afetaram no país mais de 1,3 milhões de pessoas, destruíram 236 mil casas e 3.200 salas de aula, segundo dados oficiais do Governo.

A Tongaat Hulett anunciou recentemente uma injeção de 500 milhões de rands (25 milhões de euros) nas açucareiras Mafambisse e Xinavane, ambas em Moçambique e nas quais o grupo sul-africano é acionista maioritário.

Os desafios das duas açucareiras nos últimos tempos incluem contrariar um declínio contínuo nas vendas de açúcar e obter apoio para impedir que as importações de açúcar de baixo preço entrem no mercado interno e afetem a produção doméstica.

Para dar volta à situação, segundo o diretor da Tongaat Hulett, a Açucareira de Mafambisse adotou várias estratégias, incluindo a busca de mais parceiros financeiros para alavancar a empresa.

""Reerguemo-nos embora não atingindo as expectativas. Encontrando-nos neste momento a servir os mercados da África ocidental, americano, Maurícias e Moçambique, e pensamos alargar o mercado de exportação do nosso produto para o vizinho Maláui"", concluiu Pascoal Macule.",PT,['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears'],['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other'],intempérie alteração climática afetar produção açúcar moçambique estar registar baixo produção açúcar devido dificuldade provocar intempérie registar último ano país dizer quinta-feira jornalista diretor tongaat hulett deter açucareira Mafambisse pascoal macule responsável avançar tonelada produzir anualmente firma baixar último ano criar avultar prejuízo fábrica outro fator influenciar forte quebra produção perda cerca hectare cana sacarino matéria-prima produção açúcar devido efeito alteração climática nhamatanda devido seca campo fenómeno el niño localizar posto administrativo Mafambisse distrito dor sofala açucareira capacidade instalar produzir tonelada açúcar ano moçambique considerar país severamente afetar alteração climática mundo enfrentar ciclicamente cheia ciclone tropical durante época chuvoso decorrer outubro abril período chuvoso severo haver memória pessoa morrer incluir vítima ciclone idai Kenneth grande atingir país província sofala centro território ser fustigar tempestade trimestre ano passado chuva intenso passagem ciclone freddy provocar morto afetar país milhão pessoa destruir casa sala aula dado oficial governo tongaat hulett anunciar recentemente injeção milhão rands milhão euro açucareira mafambir xinavane moçambique sul-africano acionista maioritário desafio açucareira último tempo incluir contrariar declínio contínuo venda açúcar obter impedir importação açúcar preço entr mercado interno afetar produção doméstico volta situação diretor tongaat hulett açucareira Mafambisse adotar várias estratégia incluir busca parceiro financeiro alavancar empresa reerguemo-nos atingir expectativa encontrando-nos servir mercado áfrica ocidental americano maurícia moçambique pensar alargar mercado exportação produto vizinho maláui concluir pascoal macule

O governo de Tarcísio de Freitas (Republicanos) lançou esta quinta-feira (14) um programa para tentar prevenir desastres provocados por eventos climáticos extremos no estado de São Paulo. O projeto inclui a implementação de sirenes e radares em zonas de risco.

O anúncio acontece dez meses depois dos temporais que fizeram 65 mortos no litoral norte de São Paulo, sendo a maioria em São Sebastião.

O governante esteve presente na cerimónia e afirmou que as ""alterações climáticas vieram para ficar"".

""Grandes vendavais, chuvas em grande intensidade, secas muito fortes. A palavra chave é prevenção"", disse.

Tarcísio afirmou que serão entregues em breve mais de 700 habitações para pessoas que vivem em zonas de risco em São Sebastião.

""Vem aí um período de chuva. As previsões mostram um período com bastante chuva. É a primeira leva de sirenes que vamos instalar em zonas de risco. É um trabalho que vai salvar vidas"", disse o governante.

Em setembro, o governo paulista tinha anunciado que a previsão para a instalação das sirenes era até ao final de fevereiro de 2024.

As sirenes de alerta para temporais em áreas de risco já começaram a ser utilizadas em São Sebastião e serão também instaladas no Guarujá, na Baixada Santista, e em Franco da Rocha, na Grande São Paulo. A escolha destas regiões acontece devido ao histórico de inundações e deslizamentos de terras no período chuvoso.

Outra novidade é a instalação de um novo radar, que custou 10 milhões de reais, em Ilhabela, no litoral norte. O equipamento consegue acompanhar tempestades e rajadas de vento em toda a costa de São Paulo.

O aparelho é capaz de registar as descargas elétricas na atmosfera com maior precisão, o que facilita a emissão de alertas em tempo real.

Com o objetivo de facilitar a compreensão da população sobre a gravidade de cada cenário, o governo pretende aperfeiçoar a comunicação de alertas que serão classificados com as cores verde, amarela e vermelha, dependendo do grau de risco.

Além disso, foi anunciado que foram alocados mais de 1,8 mil milhões de dólares em ações para minimizar o impacto das alterações climáticas para a população.

Deste total, cerca de 1,4 mil milhões de euros foi alocado à prevenção de cheias e inundações, em ações como a construção de novos reservatórios, limpeza das albufeiras já existentes e desassoreamento de canais e rios.

O restante montante foi utilizado para a contenção de taludes, manutenção e reparações em estradas.

A criação da nova estrutura era uma promessa de campanha assumida por Lula, aquando da adesão de Marina Silva, atual ministra do Ambiente, à sua candidatura em 2022.

— O nosso foco precisa de ser a adaptação e a preparação para o enfrentamento destes fenómenos (riscos climáticos extremos). Para isso, vamos estabelecer uma autoridade climática e um comité técnico-científico que apoie e articule a implementação das ações do governo federal — afirmou o presidente, durante um encontro com autarcas para o anúncio de medidas de combate à seca no estado, num excerto lido da sua fala.

Lula acrescentou que o ""objetivo é estabelecer as condições para ampliar e acelerar as políticas públicas a partir de um plano nacional de enfrentamento dos riscos climáticos extremos"".

De acordo com a proposta apresentada na eleição, a Autoridade Nacional para as Alterações Climáticas teria como objetivo acompanhar as medidas tomadas pelo governo para reduzir a emissão de gases que contribuem para o efeito de estufa. Após a vitória, a proposta foi posta de lado. Um dos motivos alegados era a restrição orçamental.

Lula deslocou-se ao Amazonas acompanhado pelos ministros Rui Costa (Casa Civil), Marina Silva (Ambiente), José Múcio Monteiro (Defesa), Nizia Trindade (Saúde), Wellington Dias (Desenvolvimento Social) e Silvio Costa Filho (Portos e Aeroportos.)

O presidente anunciou o investimento de 81,8 milhões de euros em intervenções de dragagem nos rios do estado do Amazonas, para facilitar a navegação no meio da seca. Foi ainda prometida a pavimentação de um troço de 20 quilómetros da rodovia BR-319, com um custo de 25,8 milhões de euros.

Durante o seu discurso, Lula criticou ainda a gestão do antecessor Jair Bolsonaro (PL).

""O plano anterior para o ambiente era claro; era abrir a porteira para deixar passar o gado. E nós pensamos que até podemos criar gado, mas não é preciso destruir a floresta e o nosso planeta para nós criarmos. E nós, por isso, estamos a tratá-lo com muita decência.""

Amazónia regista chuvas abaixo da média histórica desde julho. Nas últimas semanas, os focos de incêndio levaram cidades e até territórios indígenas a serem tomadas pelo fumo. A 27 de agosto, chegaram a ser registados 1516 focos de incêndios na Amazónia, de acordo com o painel de monitorização do Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (Inpe): 39% no Pará, 29% no Amazonas, 12% no Acre, 10% Rondônia e 8% no Mato Grosso.

Em julho, a Amazónia viveu o pior julho desde o início da série histórica de incêndios, em 1998. Além da desflorestação, o bioma sofre, pelo segundo ano consecutivo, uma seca severa.

Os residentes de Havana assistiram à chegada de navios de guerra russos pela segunda vez em poucos meses, numa visita que as Forças Armadas Revolucionárias Cubanas apelidaram de rotineira.

As autoridades cubanas dispararam tiros para o ar, assinalando as boas-vindas, enquanto pescadores curiosos observavam o passeio marítimo de Havana e os navios avançavam pela baía. Os habitantes russos estavam entre os poucos que acordaram cedo para ver a chegada da frota.

O navio de patrulha Neustrahimiy, o navio de treino Smolniy, e os navios de apoio - todos da Frota do Báltico - estão programados para partir na terça-feira.

Em junho, um submarino nuclear russo, uma fragata e navios de apoio exercitaram os músculos de Moscovo no porto de Havana, a menos de 160 quilómetros da Florida.

""Os movimentos da Rússia no Atlântico não representam qualquer ameaça direta ou preocupação para os Estados Unidos"", disse um porta-voz do Comando Norte dos Estados Unidos, acrescentando que o comando monitorizou todas as abordagens à América do Norte.

As tensões entre os Estados Unidos e a Rússia aumentaram desde a invasão da Ucrânia pela Rússia em 2022, e a atividade naval russa - embora rotineira no Atlântico - aumentou devido ao apoio dos EUA à Ucrânia, dizem as autoridades norte-americanas.

Simultaneamente, as relações entre a Rússia e Cuba, aliados da Guerra Fria, melhoraram significativamente à medida que o país governado pelos comunistas se debate com uma crise económica que acusa ser devida sobretudo às sanções dos EUA.

Um argumento comum para a conciliação dos interesses capitalistas das classes não-trabalhadoras dos grandes investimentos financeiros e os interesses de activistas pelo clima é o impacto negativo económico que os desastres causados pelas alterações climáticas terão (por exemplo, efeitos no PIB). No entanto, este argumento não só é falso como também é perigoso: Naomi Klein, no seu livro A Doutrina do Choque: O Auge do Capitalismo do Desastre, mostra como os desastres, quer sejam climáticos, políticos ou económicos, são grandes oportunidades para novos investimentos privados e políticas neoliberais, justificadas ao público de maneira abrupta e insensível por esses mesmos desastres.

Esta doutrina do choque é originária dos economistas da chamada Escola de Chicago, nomeadamente Milton Friedman. A sua ideologia de neoliberalismo (privatizações, abertura a investimento estrangeiro, baixos impostos, pouca intervenção do estado na economia) teve impactos profundos nos sistemas económicos a nível global. Tendo começado a ser posta em prática na ditadura chilena de Pinochet, a sua teoria económica alastrou-se a praticamente todos os países do mundo, incluindo Portugal. A troika foi também um exemplo do capitalismo de desastre: as dívidas e o saldo económico negativo foram usados como desculpa para por em acção um conjunto de políticas neoliberais que foram absolutamente destrutivas para os direitos da classe trabalhadora e que originaram rupturas no tecido social das quais ainda nem começámos a recuperar.

A destruição de comunidades não é má para o negócio: na verdade, é o status quo que impulsiona a criação de novas oportunidades de investimento num mundo saturado pelo sector financeiro e com um sector produtivo que já há muito tempo que não dá lucro. A destruição do Iraque pela invasão militar dos Estados Unidos originou um complexo industrial de reconstrução avaliado em 200 mil milhões de dólares, constituído apenas por multinacionais estrangeiras. É exactamente o mesmo destino que espera as áreas que serão inevitavelmente destruídas pelas alterações climáticas, quer sejam zonas históricas, florestas autóctones, populações indígenas - as comunidades locais serão substituídas a velocidades astronómicas (tal como aconteceu nas inundações em Nova Orleães durante o furacão Katrina) por medidas neoliberais e investimento estrangeiro, mesmo antes das populações traumatizadas poderem sequer reagir às mudanças que se passam à sua volta.

Para Portugal, fica a questão: quem lucra com as áreas que, ano após ano e com o aumento significativo das temperaturas, vão sendo ardidas no nosso país? Que outros desastres serão usados pelo Governo para justificar medidas altamente impopulares entre a população? Começamos agora a descobrir que as poucas medidas de ajuda económica do Governo durante a pandemia foram feitas à custa da Segurança Social, não foram bem-sucedidas em evitar despedimentos e puseram vários milhões nos bolsos de accionistas. É preciso atenção e ímpeto para a luta se queremos evitar o futuro ultra capitalista para o qual só falta um desastre para indubitavelmente sermos colectivamente levados - não obstante o Governo em causa, uma vez que tais medidas podem ser impostas por organizações internacionais ou países imperialistas que juram a pés juntos querer o nosso bem-estar.",PT,"['CC: Climate change is beneficial', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Climate change is beneficial: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",economia desastre falso amigo argumento comum conciliação interesse capitalista classe não-trabalhadoras investimento financeiro interesse activista clima impacto negativo económico desastr causar alteração climática ter efeito pib entanto argumento falso perigoso naomi klein livro doutrina choque auge capitalismo desastre mostrar desastr ser climático político económico oportunidade investimento privado política neoliberal justificar público maneira Abrupta insensível mesmo desastr doutrina choque originário economista chamado escola Chicago nomeadamente Milton friedman ideologia neoliberalismo privatização aberturar investimento estrangeiro baixo imposto intervenção economia impacto profunr sistema económico global ter começar pôr prática ditadura chileno pinochet teoria económico alastrour se praticamente país mundo incluir Portugal troika capitalismo desastre dívida saldo económico negativo usar desculpa acção conjunto política neoliberal absolutamente destrutivo direito classe trabalhadora originarar ruptura tecido social começár recuperar destruição comunidade má negócio verdade status quo impulsionar criação oportunidade investimento mundo saturar sector financeiro sector produtivo haver lucro destruição iraque invasão militar Estados Unidos originar complexo industrial reconstrução avaliar milhão dólar constituir multinacional estrangeira exactamente destino esperar área ser inevitavelmente destruír alteração climática ser zona histórico floresta autóctone população indígeno comunidade local ser substituír velocidade astronómico acontecer inundação orleães durante furacão katrina medida neoliberal investimento estrangeiro população traumatizado poder sequer reagir mudança passar volta Portugal ficar lucrar área ano ano aumento significativo temperatura ser ardir país desastr ser usar governo justificar medida altamente impopular população começar descobrir pouco medida ajuda económico governo durante pandemia fazer segurança social bem-sucedir evitar despedimento puser milhão bolso accionista preciso atenção ímpeto luta querer evitar futuro ultra capitalista desastre indubitavelmente ser colectivamente levar obstante governo causa medida impor organização internacional país imperialista jur pé junto querer bem-estar

O Canadá está a considerar a possibilidade de transferir mísseis aéreos não guiados CRV7 para a Ucrânia, mas faltam ogivas, informou esta sexta-feira (2) o canal de TV CBC.

De acordo com as notícias, as Forças Armadas canadianas possuem mais de 83 mil destes mísseis, que foram retirados de serviço no início dos anos 2000 e seriam desmantelados.

Um porta-voz do ministro da Defesa canadiano, Daniel Minden, confirmou que o governo está a considerar transferir os mísseis.

""Antes de transferirmos equipamento para a Ucrânia, trabalhamos em estreita colaboração com a Ucrânia para garantir que quaisquer donativos satisfazem as suas necessidades militares. Aplicamos o mesmo processo ao stock de mísseis CRV7"", disse Minden à emissora.

No entanto, uma fonte de defesa disse que nem todos estes mísseis têm ogivas. Segundo a estação de TV, apenas cerca de 8 mil mísseis ainda têm ogivas em bom estado.

Antes, o Reino Unido propôs à Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) discutir o envio de uma força expedicionária para a Ucrânia, além de estabelecer uma zona de exclusão aérea sobre o território controlado pelas autoridades de Kiev.

As ofertas surgem no meio de uma série de problemas do regime do presidente Vladimir Zelensky com as Forças Armadas da Ucrânia, que inclusive esta semana teve rumores de uma alegada demissão do comandante Valery Zaluzhny, o que foi negado na sequência por Kiev.

A Rússia enviou anteriormente uma nota aos países da NATO sobre o fornecimento de armas à Ucrânia, na qual o Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, observou que qualquer carga que contenha armas para a Ucrânia se tornará um alvo legítimo para a Rússia.

A Rússia está a conduzir uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia desde 24 de fevereiro de 2022. O presidente Vladimir Putin afirmou que a operação visa ""proteger as pessoas sujeitas ao genocídio pelo regime de Kiev durante oito anos"".

Segundo o presidente, o objetivo final da operação é libertar o Donbass e criar condições que assegurem a segurança da Rússia.

Ainda parece que foi ontem que 3 deputados do Chega levaram cartazes com bandeiras da Ucrânia como protesto contra Lula da Silva, mas na verdade foi já há 10 dias que isso aconteceu.

Talvez para festejar essa iniciativa na defesa do povo ucraniano, André Ventura partilhou hoje uma foto com o Presidente da Hungria e um dos principais aliados de Putin na Europa, como provam as suas declarações e posições, muito mais denunciadores na defesa da Rússia contra a Ucrânia, do que Lula da Silva.

André Ventura partilhou hoje a foto de Viktor Orbán com a sua camisola e escreveu:

Os Estados Unidos terão vetado um plano ucraniano para atacar o desfile anual do Dia da Marinha, que contou com a presença do presidente Vladimir Putin, em julho último, denunciou uma alta autoridade russa – de acordo com Sergei Ryabkov, vice-ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia, em declarações numa transmissão no canal de TV estatal ‘Russia-1’, os americanos intervieram numa conspiração que teria levado a uma “nova escalada”.

Os serviços de Inteligência da Ucrânia tinham preparada uma provocação contra Putin durante o desfile, no passado dia 28: esse plano terá sido interrompido após um telefonema entre o ministro da Defesa russo, Andrei Belousov, e o secretário de Defesa dos EUA, Lloyd Austin, a 12 de julho, destacou Ryabkov. “O sinal da nossa liderança militar e do ministro da defesa ao nosso colega americano deve ter tido um impacto”, acrescentou Ryabkov.

De acordo com os media russos, incluindo a estatal ‘RT’, os serviços de Inteligência de Kiev estavam a preparar uma tentativa de assassinato de Putin e Belousov no desfile. De acordo com o jornal americano ‘New York Times’, no passado dia 26, Belousov solicitou um telefonema com Austin sobre uma suposta operação secreta ucraniana que Moscovo acreditava ter recebido sinal verde de Washington.

De acordo com duas autoridades dos EUA, que falaram sob anonimato, as autoridades de defesa não sabiam de tal operação e ficaram surpreendidas com as alegações de Belousov, tendo contactado a Ucrânia após o telefonema.

Putin realizou um desfile anual notavelmente silencioso para marcar o Dia da Marinha Russa no mês passado. O desfile principal em Kronstadt foi cancelado, enquanto um evento menor ocorreu em São Petersburgo, no Rio Neva. Pela primeira vez, não houve desfile no Mar Negro ou em Novorossiysk “por razões de segurança”, informou a agência de notícias estatal russa ‘RIA Novosti’.",PT,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",EUA ter vetar plano ucraniano assassinar putin dia marinha revelar ministro russo Estados Unidos ter vetar plano ucraniano atacar desfile anual dia marinha contar presença presidente vladimir putin julho denunciar alto autoridade russo acordo sergei ryabkov vice-ministro negócio estrangeiro Rússia declaração transmissão canal tv estatal russia- americano intervier conspiração ter levar escalada serviço inteligência ucrânia ter preparado provocação putin durante desfile passado dia plano ter ser interromper telefonema ministro defesa russo Andrei Belousov secretário defesa EUA Lloyd Austin julho destacar ryabkov sinal liderança militar ministro defesa colega americano ter impacto acrescentar ryabkov acordo media russo incluir estatal rt serviço inteligência kiev estar preparar tentativa assassinato putin Belousov desfile acordo jornal americano New York time passado dia belousov solicitar telefonema Austin suposto operação secreto ucraniana Moscovo acreditar receber sinal verde Washington acordo autoridade EUA falar anonimato autoridade defesa sab operação ficar surpreender alegação belousov ter contactar ucrânia telefonema putin realizar desfile anual notavelmente silencioso marcar dia marinha russo passado desfile principal kronstadt cancelar evento ocorrer petersburgo rio neva haver desfile mar negro novorossiysk razão segurança informar agência notícia estatal russo rio novosti

Patético e deprimente são as palavras que me ocorrem para ilustrar o que vi nas nossas televisões a partir das nove horas.

Greta Thunberg, que não surgiu do nada, sendo, obviamente, uma criação de alguém como símbolo contra certos interesses, não podia atracar em melhor país do que Portugal, onde não faltam parolos ávidos de serem modernaços. A menina e seus acompanhantes fizeram a viagem dos EUA para a Europa num barco supermoderno e pouco poluente – que custa uma fortuna – e tinha à sua espera o inefável presidente da Câmara de Lisboa, que se sentiu como numa espécie de segunda Web Summit. Os diretos televisivos ainda no mar ou rio, como se queira, faziam crer que estava para chegar uma sumidade científica que nos trazia a solução para o problema da poluição global. Mas não. Era apenas uma criança que diz aquilo que todos sabemos, embora as suas palavras lancinantes, que funcionaram como um murro no estômago para alguns escribas, não passem de um grito de alerta, à semelhança de tantos outros. Outro dado curioso é que estavam mais jornalistas presentes do que manifestantes da causa. O ridículo foi tanto que os jornalistas entrevistaram quase todos as mesmas pessoas presentes no local. Penso que não foi por acaso que não houve nenhuma imagem que mostrasse a multidão (inexistente) presente. Greta apresenta alguma solução inovadora para o problema do aquecimento global? Não, é apenas um símbolo dos tempos modernos que precisa destas coisas para se animar.

Comparada à COP28, as negociações ocorreram de forma mais estruturada, sem a confusão da Green Zone, das centenas de Pavilhões e eventos paralelos e com uma participação da sociedade civil muito mais reduzida – o que, a priori, poderia indicar uma maior apetência para a desburocratização e negociações rápidas. Mas não foi o que aconteceu.

Cerca de 6.000 participantes de quase 200 países reuniram-se para abordar assuntos como os Planos Nacionais de Mitigação (NDCs) e de Adaptação (NAPs), o Fundo de Perdas e Danos, a aceleração da ação climática através de uma transição justa, o artigo 6.º do Acordo de Paris (Mercados de Carbono) e o Quadro de Transparência. O financiamento climático, em particular a Nova Meta Quantificada Coletiva de Financiamento Climático (NCQG), ficará para ser decidido, quase na sua totalidade, na COP29, no Azerbaijão, tornando-se o “elefante da sala”.

Apesar das expectativas alicerçadas no resultado do Balanço Global da COP28 sobre financiamento climático, a SB60 representou o passo de caracol das negociações climáticas e uma omissão grave perante o compromisso informal para o abandono dos combustíveis fósseis. Voltamos para casa com duas mãos cheias de nada e duas cheias de tudo para o Azerbaijão.

Os grandes acordos da SB60 disseram respeito à extensão dos textos apresentados para negociação, e à divisão estrutural entre as visões dos Países Desenvolvidos e dos Países em Desenvolvimento.

O modelo atual de negociações climáticas, conhecido como “Processo de Negociação Global”, tem-se demonstrado ineficaz, burocrático e dominado pelo Norte Global. Todos os anos, os negociadores reúnem-se para discutir e tomar decisões sobre a melhor forma de combater as alterações climáticas. Os instrumentos de trabalho para as negociações são os textos de negociação, baseados em propostas escritas apresentadas pelos governos. No final de uma negociação, o Presidente bate o martelo para declarar que foi adotada uma decisão ou um novo tratado. A COP é o órgão supremo de decisão do processo de alterações climáticas e caminhamos rumo à 29.ª.

A ineficiência torna-se ainda mais preocupante perante o aumento consecutivo, ano após ano, das emissões de gases de efeito estufa (GEE). Urge repensar o modelo tradicional de negociações e torná-lo mais eficiente, acessível e transparente à sociedade civil, garantindo um processo justo e equitativo que incorpore juridicamente as necessidades dos países na linha da frente.

No limite: torná-lo um verdadeiro órgão de Ação Climática, sob pena de virar o “dinossauro” na sala. Nada menos do que isso será suficiente para limitarmos a temperatura média do planeta a 1.5 ºC.

O ministro da Defesa chinês afirma que a cooperação entre Moscovo e Pequim é um pilar para a manutenção da paz mundial e elogiou a posição russa em relação a Taiwan.

Na sua primeira aparição pública após ter sido nomeado como ministro da Defesa, no final do ano passado, Dong Jun disse ao seu homólogo russo, Sergei Shoigu, que a cooperação estratégica entre a China e a Rússia é um pilar para a manutenção da paz mundial.

Durante uma reunião por videochamada, os responsáveis concordaram que a China e a Rússia devem aprofundar a sua cooperação e responder de forma decisiva aos desafios globais.

""Apoiámo-los na questão ucraniana, apesar de os EUA e a União Europeia continuarem a pressionar o lado chinês"", afirmou Dong, prometendo que Pequim ""não mudará nem abandonará o nosso rumo político estabelecido sobre esta questão"", mesmo sob a ameaça de mais sanções.

Ao mesmo tempo, segundo o ministro chinês, a China percebe o ""forte apoio do lado russo na questão de Taiwan, bem como noutros tópicos dos nossos principais interesses"", acrescentou. ""Enquanto duas forças mais importantes e fundamentais do mundo, devemos responder de forma decisiva aos desafios globais"", reiterou.

Dong criticou ainda a tentativa dos Estados Unidos de manter a sua hegemonia tendo a Rússia e a China como alvos certeiros. ""A história e a realidade provam que a hegemonia está condenada ao fracasso"".

O ministro russo disse que, ao contrário dos Estados ocidentais, a Rússia e a China não estão a ""criar blocos militares"" e a cooperação militar entre ambos não é ""dirigida contra países terceiros"". Shoigu observou que ""as relações russo-chinesas na esfera militar estão a desenvolver-se de forma constante em todas as áreas"" e disse estar ansioso por uma ""cooperação estreita e produtiva"" com o seu homólogo chinês.

A posição da China em relação ao conflito entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia criou tensões entre o país asiático e os EUA. As autoridades norte-americanas acusam Pequim de apoiar Moscovo, em vez de demonstrar neutralidade. A China, por sua vez, culpa a extensão da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) na Europa pela crise na Ucrânia e denunciou o uso de sanções unilaterais por parte dos EUA e dos seus aliados como ferramenta de pressão geopolítica.

A União Europeia transferiu, esta sexta-feira (26), cerca de 1,5 mil milhões de euros em apoio à Ucrânia, provenientes dos lucros gerados pelos ativos russos congelados no bloco.

Os países da UE chegaram a acordo em maio para utilizar milhares de milhões de euros gerados por estes activos para armar a Ucrânia e financiar a sua reconstrução no pós-guerra.

A UE congelou cerca de 200 mil milhões de euros em ativos do Banco Central russo detidos no bloco no âmbito das sanções impostas à Rússia devido à sua invasão na Ucrânia em 2022.

Cerca de 90% destes fundos estão sob controlo da empresa de serviços financeiros Euroclear, sediada na Bélgica.

""A UE apoia a Ucrânia. Hoje transferimos 1,5 mil milhões de euros provenientes de ativos russos mobilizados para a defesa e reconstrução da Ucrânia"", declarou em comunicado a presidente da Comissão Europeia, Ursula von der Leyen.

O bloco anunciou que 90% dos lucros seriam destinados a um fundo utilizado para comprar armas para Kiev, conhecido como Mecanismo Europeu de Apoio à Paz. Os outros 10% seriam direcionados para o fundo da UE para apoiar a reconstrução da Ucrânia.

A Rússia classificou a medida como ""ilegal"".

""Esta é uma razão para tomar medidas em resposta às decisões ilegais como esta, que são implementadas pela União Europeia"", afirmou Dmitri Peskov, porta-voz do Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, à imprensa.

Já o primeiro-ministro ucraniano, Denys Shymgal, agradeceu o apoio.

""Obrigado, Von der Leyen e UE, pelo vosso firme apoio e este importante contributo para a defesa e reconstrução da Ucrânia"", publicou nas suas redes sociais.

(ANSA) - Um relatório divulgado esta quarta-feira (13) por uma organização britânica apontou que 23% dos produtos alimentares preferidos dos italianos poderão sofrer um aumento significativo de preço devido às alterações climáticas.

As nações em desenvolvimento de onde provêm vários produtos tradicionais contidos nas listas de compras das famílias italianas estão a ""sofrer com os efeitos da seca, do calor e das inundações"".

O estudo da Christian Aid indica ainda que sete dos 25 principais parceiros comerciais de Roma para as importações, entre eles o Brasil, a Argentina, a Colômbia e o Equador, ""são países com elevada vulnerabilidade climática e baixo grau de capacidade de adaptação"".

A situação, adverte a associação, só poderá piorar se as nações ricas não cumprirem a sua promessa de investir 100 mil milhões de dólares no clima e de duplicar o financiamento para estratégias de adaptação até 2050, como prometido na COP de Glasgow.

O preço do café importado do Brasil, por exemplo, ""aumentou devido a uma combinação de secas e geadas, atribuídas às alterações climáticas, que contribuíram para a queda das reservas globais para o seu nível mais baixo em 20 anos"".

Quanto à produção de conservas de atum na Costa do Marfim, segundo a Christian Aid, vai ser seriamente afectada pela pesca intensiva, com quebras de até 36% até 2050.

""O estilo de vida dos italianos poderá ser radicalmente perturbado pelos impactos climáticos. Para preservar a cultura tradicional italiana é necessário intensificar os esforços a nível mundial para alcançar emissões zero"", alertou Luca Bergamaschi, um dos diretores do Ecco Climate.

Esta semana, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Ucrânia, Dmitry Kuleba, deslocou-se a Nova Deli em busca de apoio da nação mais populosa do mundo, querendo aprofundar os laços com os países do Sul Global devido ao momento crítico da Ucrânia no campo de batalha.

Em entrevista ao Financial Times, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros instou o Governo indiano a apoiar Kiev, afirmando que os laços estreitos entre a Índia e a Rússia assentam num ""legado soviético"".

A visita do chanceler é a primeira de um alto funcionário ucraniano à Índia desde que a operação russa na Ucrânia começou.

""A cooperação entre a Índia e a Rússia baseia-se em grande parte no legado soviético. Mas este não é o legado que será guardado durante séculos; é um legado que se está a evaporar"", afirmou.

Kuleba fez ainda uma provocação ao relacionar a amizade entre Moscovo e Pequim e o que supostamente a China representa para a Índia atualmente.

""A relação sino-russa deve merecer especial atenção para a Índia, à luz das suas prerrogativas de segurança nacional.""

Indo mais longe com os seus argumentos para convencer Nova Deli, Kuleba citou que quando o conflito terminar, a Ucrânia ""provavelmente tornar-se-á o maior estaleiro de construção do mundo e as empresas indianas são bem-vindas a participar na recuperação"".

Kiev procura agora ""restaurar o comércio"" com a Índia, disse o ministro, retomando as exportações de produtos agrícolas como o óleo de girassol e comprando ela própria mais produtos indianos: ""Estamos interessados em importar alguns dos artigos de maquinaria pesada que a Índia produz "", acrescentou.

A Ucrânia tem lutado para ganhar a simpatia da Índia e de muitos outros países do Sul Global. Estes Estados evitaram, na sua maioria, tomar partido num conflito que consideram ""ser da conta das nações ricas"" e cujo preço económico pagaram em perturbações comerciais e custos mais elevados, analisa a comunicação social.

Apesar das declarações de Kuleba sobre os laços entre Moscovo e Nova Deli estarem a ""evaporar-se"", a Rússia continua a ser o maior fornecedor de armas da Índia.

O Estado indiano tornou-se também um dos principais compradores de crude russo após a operação russa na Ucrânia, além disso, a Índia partilha com Moscovo (juntamente com a China e o Brasil) a fundação original dos BRICS.

Os meios de comunicação social recordam que, anteriormente, Kuleba afirmou que cada barril de crude russo comprado pela Índia continha ""uma boa porção de sangue ucraniano"". No entanto, Kiev tem procurado suavizar as relações com Nova Deli, à medida que tenta conquistar mais países para a sua causa, escreve o Financial Times.

O sol aparece com nuvens no Rio Grande do Sul, mas diferentes pontos do Estado deverão ter momentos de maior nebulosidade ao longo deste sábado. Uma frente fria passa ao longo da costa e induz instabilidade no continente, o que deverá trazer chuva em várias regiões do país.

Prevê-se que as precipitações isoladas atinjam mais locais das metades Norte e Oeste. Será mais um dia sem o calor mais forte típico desta época do ano em grande parte do Estado, esperando-se um maior aquecimento em cidades do Noroeste e da Fronteira Oeste do Rio Grande do Sul.

O temporal de terça-feira

Os temporais são comuns no nosso Estado, não raras vezes são severos, como parte do nosso clima, com ou sem alterações climáticas. Há um século, o temporal arrasador passou por Porto Alegre em 5/12/1923. O porto foi destelhado, a cidade ficou às escuras depois de a rede elétrica ter sido devastada, houve muitos estragos e até derrocadas de cinemas e teatros. “O furacão da madrugada de ontem” foi a manchete do Correio do Povo no dia seguinte. Assim, os temporais violentos, embora não ocorram a toda a hora, sempre fizeram parte da história de Porto Alegre. O que é a variabilidade natural do clima e não as alterações climáticas. O El Niño, no Pacífico, que agrava o risco de tempestades fortes neste verão de 2024, é igualmente um fenómeno de variabilidade natural que, por exemplo, favoreceu a grande cheia de 1941.

Sobre nada. Vazio

Segundo Zelensky, o ""plano de vitória"" será a ""ponte para a cimeira da paz"" e será possível terminar a guerra ""não mais tarde do que 2025"". Ou seja, primeiro é preciso vencer a Rússia, depois realizar a cimeira da paz - e tudo isto até 2025. Acreditamos.

O plano consiste no seguinte:

1.º - Convite à Ucrânia para a NATO ainda antes do fim da guerra. Ou seja, exatamente por causa do que desencadeou a operação especial na Ucrânia. Para que ela não entre na NATO.

2.º - Continuação das operações no território da Rússia e remoção das restrições aos ataques ao seu território. Destruição da aviação russa em conjunto com parceiros, expansão da utilização de drones e mísseis ucranianos; acesso a dados de inteligência dos parceiros. Kiev já recebe dados de inteligência, a expansão da utilização é sobre dinheiro, e a destruição conjunta da aviação russa é um caminho certo não para a paz, mas para a Terceira Guerra Mundial. Claro que há idiotas no Ocidente. Mas não em número suficiente para suportar este ponto do plano.

3.º - Colocação de um ""pacote de dissuasão não nuclear"" no território da Ucrânia. E, novamente, é referida aquela que foi uma das razões para o início da operação militar. Cujo objetivo, recordo, é a desmilitarização da Ucrânia.

4.º - Desenvolvimento do potencial estratégico-económico da Ucrânia e intensificação das sanções contra a Rússia. Segundo Zelensky, a Ucrânia possui muito urânio, titânio e outros recursos úteis. Haverá sanções, mas como desenvolver a extração de urânio na Ucrânia se os ""Calibres"" continuarem a voar para lá constantemente? Um plano de investimento muito estranho.

5.º - Após o fim da guerra, as forças armadas ucranianas poderão utilizar a sua experiência para reforçar a defesa da NATO e da Europa, e o contingente americano na Europa poderá substituir as tropas ucranianas. Aparentemente, é algo genético (embora pareça estranho), o desejo de se tornar uma polícia pan-europeia ao serviço da hegemonia ultramarina. Mas como se conciliará esta ousadia com os planos da Polónia, que também a ela aspira? E a questão principal: quem pagará este banquete?

Segundo Zelensky, os segundo, terceiro e quarto pontos têm apêndices secretos que foram apresentados aos parceiros. Pode-se argumentar que todos estes segredos se resumem a ""dar dinheiro"".

O principal problema do ""plano"" é a sua esfericidade no vácuo. A Rússia e as suas ações não são consideradas e Kiev considera o recurso temporal como trabalhando a seu favor.

É interessante ver como o Ocidente reagirá a este disparate. Se do ""outro lado"" a resposta for um silêncio ensurdecedor, então Zelensky deve abandonar tudo e fugir, sem esperar pelas eleições presidenciais nos EUA. Se o plano for apoiado (o que é improvável), então todos devemos recordar este planeta como ele é agora. Se a NATO começar a abater as nossas aeronaves - nós começamos a abater as deles. E atacar os locais de onde a sua aviação descola. O processo continuará em escalada e conduzirá a consequências nucleares compreensíveis.

Mais um empresário próximo de Putin morre após cair de janela

Mikhail Rogachev, de 64 anos, foi encontrado morto pelos espiões de Putin depois de cair da janela da sua casa em Moscovo, que se encontrava a 33 metros de altura, no 10.º andar. O oligarca foi vice-presidente da petrolífera Yukos, forçada a fechar portas por defender posições contrárias às de Putin.

Os meios de comunicação locais estão a avançar que se deverá ter tratado de um suicídio, uma vez que os agentes da SVR dizem ter encontrado um bilhete dentro de casa e que Mikhail Rogachev sofria de cancro. Porém, esses relatos foram contrariados pelos seus familiares e amigos mais próximos. Alguns familiares referiram não existirem quaisquer sinais de que o oligarca fosse suicida e que pouco antes da sua morte se encontrava de ""bom humor"".

Mikhail Rogachev fez carreira enquanto empresário em algumas das principais empresas russas da era pós-soviética. Entre 1996 e 2007, trabalhou para a Yukos, liderada pelo opositor Mikhail Khodorkovsky, que foi posteriormente preso por se opor a Putin. Em 2007, a empresa foi encerrada pelo regime russo. No mesmo ano o oligarca tornou-se vice-diretor da empresa de mineração e metalurgia Norilsk Nickel, liderada pelo homem mais rico da Rússia Vladimir Potanin. Mikhail Rogachev foi também diretor executivo de inovação no fundo de investimento privado Onexim Gropu. Em 2013, foi perdoado por Putin.

Mikhail Rogachev junta-se a uma já longa lista de mortes inexplicáveis de importantes figuras russas desde o início da invasão à Ucrânia, em fevereiro de 2022. Ravil Maganov, magnata da Lukoil, caiu de uma janela da clínica do Kremlin em setembro de 2022 e os meios de comunicação locais rapidamente trataram o caso como um suicídio, apesar de não existirem provas e do local onde ocorreu o incidente não estar coberto pelas câmaras de vigilância do hospital.

Já em outubro de 2023 Vladimir Nekrasov, o substituto de Rogachev, morreu por ""insuficiência cardíaca aguda"" e no mês seguinte o senador Vladimir Lebedev, também com ligações à Lukoil, morreu do que foi classificado como ""ataque cardíaco"". E em março deste ano, Vitaly Robertus, o ex-presidente da Lukoil, também foi encontrado morto.

No entanto, as mortes não ficam limitadas à Lukoil. Em dezembro de 2023, Vladimir Egorov, importante aliado de Putin, morreu depois de saltar de uma janela no terceiro andar e o corpo foi encontrado no seu quintal. Egorov era especialmente influente na região de Tobolsk, cidade rica em petróleo, no oeste da Sibéria. No mesmo mês, mas uns dias antes, a vice-editora de um jornal de propaganda russa foi encontrada morta com apenas 35 anos: Anna Tsareva morreu cerca de um ano depois da morte do seu chefe Vladimir Sungorkin.

No início de 2024, a editora-chefe da televisão estatal, Zoya Konovalova, foi encontrada morta depois de uma suspeita de envenenamento. Em junho, a juíza Natalia Larina caiu de um prédio em Moscovo. Natalia Larina era famosa por lidar com casos políticos de alto nível, punindo vários traidores do Kremlin.",PT,['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups'],['URW: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other'],empresário putin morrer cair janela mikhail rogachev ano encontrar matar espião putin cair janela casa Moscovo encontrar metro altura andar oligarca vice-presidente petrolífera yukos forçar fechar porta defender posição contrário putin meio comunicação local avançar tratar suicídio agente svr encontrar bilhete casa Mikhail rogachev sofria cancro relato contrariar familiar amigo próximo familiar referir existir qualquer sinal oligarca ser suicida morte encontrar humor Mikhail rogachev carreira empresário principal empresa russo pós-soviética trabalhar yukos liderar opositor Mikhail khodorkovsky posteriormente prender opor putin empresa encerrar regime russo ano oligarca tornar se vice-diretor empresa mineração metalurgia norilsk nickel liderar homem rico Rússia vladimir potanin Mikhail rogachev diretor executivo inovação fundo investimento privado onexim gropu perdoar putin mikhail rogachev junta-se longo lista morte inexplicável importante figura russo início invasão ucrânia fevereiro ravil maganov magnata lukoil cair janela clínica kremlin setembro meio comunicação local rapidamente tratar caso suicídio apesar existir prova ocorrer incidente coberto câmara vigilância hospital outubro vladimir nekrasov substituto rogachev morrer insuficiência cardíaco agudar seguinte senador vladimir lebedev ligação lukoil morrer classificar ataque cardíaco março ano vitaly robertus ex-presidente lukoil encontrar matar entanto morte ficar limitado lukoil dezembro vladimir egorov importante aliar putin morrer saltar janela andar corpo encontrar quintal egorov especialmente influente região tobolsk cidade rico petróleo oeste sibéria dia vice-editora jornal propaganda russo encontrar morto ano anna tsareva morrer cerca ano morte chefe vladimir sungorkin início editora-chefe televisão estatal zoya konovalova encontrar morto suspeita envenenamento junho juíza natalio larino cair prédio Moscovo natalia larino famoso lidar caso político alto punir traidor kremlin
PT_85.txt,URW: Russia is the Victim,URW: Russia is the Victim: Other,"Rússia restringe acesso de civis a aldeias na região fronteiriça bombardeada pela Ucrânia

O acesso a 14 aldeias na região de Belgorod, no sul da Rússia, na fronteira com a Ucrânia, vai estar fechado à maioria dos civis, disse o governador Vyacheslav Gladkov, esta terça-feira, citando a situação ""extremamente difícil"" devido aos bombardeamentos ucranianos.

Ao anunciar as novas restrições num vídeo publicado no seu canal de Telegram, Gladkov disse que, a partir da próxima semana, apenas os homens adultos que acompanhem militares ou funcionários do governo terão permissão para entrar nos locais. Os homens devem viajar em veículos blindados e usar coletes à prova de bala e capacetes, acrescentou.

""Espero que concordem que é inaceitável permitir que mulheres e crianças entrem nos colonatos que são bombardeados todos os dias"", disse Gladkov.

""Já perdemos muitos civis, temos muitos feridos. E, claro, a nossa tarefa é maximizar as medidas de segurança.""

A região de Belgorod está sob fogo frequente de bombardeamentos ucranianos e drones.

As sirenes de ataque aéreo tocam quase diariamente na capital regional com o mesmo nome, a apenas 40 km a norte da fronteira.

A Ucrânia diz que o bombardeamento russo nas cidades ucranianas tem sido devastador e, após quase dois anos e meio de guerra, as forças russas estão agora no controlo de cerca de um quinto da Ucrânia.

O Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, disse em maio que as forças russas estão a trabalhar para criar uma zona tampão no nordeste da Ucrânia para proteger a Rússia dos ataques lançados pelas forças de Kiev do outro lado da fronteira.

O anúncio de Gladkov é um sinal de que a situação de segurança na região pode ter-se tornado mais grave, levando as autoridades a fazer mais para proteger a população civil.

O responsável da empresa petrolífera dos Emirados Árabes Unidos foi nomeado esta quinta-feira (12) presidente da conferência anual do clima da ONU, marcada para o final do ano no país do Golfo, atraindo críticas dos defensores do ambiente.

O ministro da Indústria dos Emirados, presidente da gigante petrolífera ADNOC (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) e enviado especial para as alterações climáticas, Sultan Ahmed al Jaber, é o ""presidente designado para a 28.ª Conferência das Partes (COP28)"", informou um comunicado da agência de notícias oficial WAM, esta quinta-feira.

Será a primeira vez que o presidente de uma empresa vai comandar os trabalhos da COP, que este ano se realiza no Dubai, entre novembro e dezembro.

""Traremos uma abordagem pragmática, realista e orientada para a procura de soluções"", declarou Sultan Ahmed al Jaber, após a sua nomeação. ""A ação climática representa uma grande oportunidade económica para investir no crescimento sustentável. O financiamento é a chave"", acrescentou.

Sultan Ahmed al Jaber dirige a petrolífera nacional dos Emirados desde 2016, assim como a Masdar, a empresa de energias renováveis do país.

O seu duplo papel valeu-lhe críticas de ambientalistas.

""A nomeação de Sultan Ahmed al Jaber para a presidência da COP28, como presidente da empresa petrolífera nacional de Abu Dhabi, é um conflito de interesses ultrajante"", afirmou Harjeet Singh, da Climate Action Network International.

""A ameaça constante dos lobistas dos combustíveis fósseis nas negociações climáticas da ONU sempre prejudicou os resultados das conferências climáticas. Esta situação atingiu agora um nível perigoso e sem precedentes"", acrescentou.

Os lobistas do petróleo e do gás foram numerosos na COP27 organizada em Novembro passado no Egipto, mais 25% do que na reunião anterior em Glasgow, segundo as associações ambientais.

O maior contingente de lobistas era dos Emirados, seguidos pelos russos.

Os Emirados Árabes Unidos, um dos maiores exportadores de petróleo do mundo, defendem a eliminação progressiva dos hidrocarbonetos e comprometeram-se a alcançar a neutralidade carbónica até 2050.

O país registou um rápido crescimento económico desde a década de 1970, graças ao petróleo, mas a sua economia diversificou-se gradualmente.

""Limitar o aquecimento a 1,5°C [conforme estabelecido no Acordo de Paris de 2015] exigirá reduções significativas das emissões, uma abordagem pragmática, prática e realista da transição energética e uma maior ajuda às economias emergentes"", refere o comunicado hoje divulgado.

As alterações climáticas são uma questão delicada nos países do Golfo, onde as temperaturas costumam atingir os 50°C no verão.

O Presidente da Rússia, Vladimir Putin, disse, esta segunda-feira, que as conversações de paz com a Ucrânia já não fazem sentido, depois da incursão militar ucraniana em solo russo.

No decorrer de uma reunião especial, onde se debateu a situação nas zonas fronteiriças, Putin, que prometeu uma “resposta firme” à incursão militar da Ucrânia, referiu que: “Torna-se agora claro que o regime de Kiev recusou as nossas propostas para o regresso a um plano de acordo pacífico”.

“O inimigo, com a ajuda dos seus chefes ocidentais, está agora a efetuar a sua aposta, e o Ocidente mantém uma guerra contra nós utilizando-se dos ucranianos para melhorar a sua posição negocial no futuro”, considerou o presidente da Rússia.

Para Putin, manter conversações com um Governo “que ataca civis” não faz sentido: “Mas de que negociações podemos falar agora? Que poderemos falar com eles?”.

Na terça-feira da semana passada, a Ucrânia realizou uma ampla incursão em na região fronteiriça russa de Kursk, a mais importante desde a invasão em larga escala da Ucrânia pelas forças russas em fevereiro de 2022.

Para o presidente da Rússia um dos objetivos desta operação da Ucrânia consiste em travar a ofensiva de Moscovo no leste e sul da Ucrânia.

Putin assegurou que a “principal tarefa do Ministério da Defesa consiste sem qualquer dúvida em expulsar o inimigo dos nossos territórios” e acusou também Kiev de “”executar a vontade dos ocidentais” e pretender “semear a discórdia” na sociedade russa.

“Um outro objetivo do inimigo consiste em semear a discórdia e a divisão na nossa sociedade, intimidar as pessoas, destruir a unidade e a coesão da sociedade russa”, acrescentou.",PT,"['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: The West does not care about Ukraine, only about its interests', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies']",putin afasto possibilidade conversação paz ucrânia presidente Rússia vladimir putin dizer segunda-feira conversação paz ucrânia sentido incursão militar ucraniana solo russo decorrer reunião especial debater situação zona fronteiriça putin prometer resposta firme incursão militar ucrânia referir tornar se claro regime kiev recusar proposta regresso plano acordo Pacífico inimigo ajuda chefe ocidental efetuar aposta ocidente manter guerra utilizando-se ucraniano melhorar negocial futuro considerar presidente rússia putin manter conversação governo atacar civis sentido negociação poder falar poderemos falar terça-feira semana passado ucrânia realizar amplo incursão região fronteiriço russo kursk importante invasão larga escala ucrânia força russo fevereiro presidente Rússia objetivo operação ucrânia consistir travar ofensiva Moscovo leste sul ucrânia putin assegurar principal tarefa ministério defesa consistir dúvida expulsar inimigo território acusar kiev executar vontade ocidental pretender semear discórdia sociedade russo outro objetivo inimigo consistir semear discórdia divisão sociedade intimidar pessoa destruir unidade coesão sociedade russo acrescentar
PT_176.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Profecias de Nostradamus para 2024: drama do Rei Carlos, guerra e tsunami

As profecias do conceituado filósofo francês Nostradamus para 2024 foram reveladas e trazem consigo notícias preocupantes sobre o que o próximo ano poderá reservar para o mundo. Nostradamus, cujas previsões precisas incluíram acontecimentos históricos como a ascensão de Adolf Hitler e o assassinato do presidente John F. Kennedy, lançou as suas visões sobre o futuro no livro Les Prophéties há mais de 450 anos. As suas palavras têm sido consideradas ‘um alerta’ do que está para vir.

Uma das previsões mais alarmantes sugere que o rei Carlos poderá enfrentar tempos difíceis em 2024. Embora o texto não mencione um rei específico, especula-se que se refira ao atual líder da monarquia britânica. Os analistas interpretaram as palavras de Nostradamus como um possível cenário de abdicação devido aos ataques persistentes ao rei e à sua segunda mulher, a rainha Camila.

Noutra previsão intrigante, Nostradamus antevê um conflito naval iminente, indicando que um “inimigo vermelho” ficará pálido de medo, colocando o oceano em estado de apreensão. Muitos acreditam que esse adversário vermelho é a China comunista, sugerindo um possível confronto no Oceano Índico.

Além disso, Nostradamus alerta para desastres relacionados com as alterações climáticas. Prevê que a Terra se tornará cada vez mais árida, resultando em inundações e na subida dos níveis do mar à medida que as calotas de gelo derretem. O místico alerta para uma possível grande fome devido às ondas pestilentas, indicando a possibilidade de um tsunami que ameaçaria as colheitas.

O futuro da Igreja Católica: eleição de um novo Papa

Nostradamus faz ainda uma previsão relacionada com a Igreja Católica, sugerindo que o Papa Francisco poderá falecer em 2024. Completando 88 anos em dezembro, o Papa poderá ser substituído por um “romano idoso” após a sua morte. Embora existam vários potenciais candidatos, a escolha será feita entre cardeais com menos de 80 anos.

As previsões negras de Nostradamus para 2024 deixam o mundo em alerta, instigando reflexões sobre o futuro incerto que nos espera. Enquanto alguns permanecem céticos, a precisão das previsões anteriores do filósofo aumenta a apreensão global sobre o que está para vir.

""A operação militar especial"" russa na Ucrânia, ""é, de facto, um confronto armado entre a Rússia e o Ocidente coletivo"", disse Belousov na abertura do fórum Armiya-2024 (Exército-2024), nos arredores de Moscovo.

A Rússia designa oficialmente a guerra na Ucrânia, que invadiu em 24 de fevereiro de 2022, como uma ""operação militar especial"".

Belousov disse que o conflito se deve ao desejo dos Estados Unidos e dos seus aliados de manterem o domínio e ""impedirem a construção de uma nova ordem mundial multipolar e igualitária"".

""Nesse sentido, este confronto afeta os interesses de todos os países"", afirmou, citado pela agência espanhola EFE.

Belousov disse que a Rússia vai continuar a modernizar o armamento e as forças armadas para ganhar vantagem sobre os inimigos, referindo que os trabalhos do fórum deste ano vão centrar-se nessa ideia-chave.

O Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, também enviou saudações aos participantes no evento e disse esperar a assinatura de muitos contratos.

""Não tenho dúvidas de que (...) serão reforçados e estabelecidos novos laços promissores e celebrados contratos mutuamente benéficos entre o Ministério da Defesa e as empresas do complexo militar-industrial russo"", disse Putin.

O fórum tornará ""a interação dos nossos países próximos e amigos na esfera da segurança e da proteção dos interesses nacionais ainda mais eficaz"", aacrescentou, numa mensagem em vídeo.

A edição deste ano da Armiya-2024 conta com a participação de representantes de cerca de 1.500 empresas do complexo militar-industrial russo, mas realiza-se em menor escala e durante apenas três dias.

Durante o evento, mais de 28.000 peças de equipamento militar e de dupla utilização estarão em exposição numa área de 160.000 metros quadrados.

Os Estados Unidos e a Europa fornecem à Ucrânia armamento obsoleto que tem de ser aposentado. Ao mesmo tempo, estas nações exaltam o seu empenho na causa do país. Quem o diz é a National Interest, revista norte-americana especializada em relações internacionais.

O meio de comunicação social salientou ainda que as armas dadas a Kiev são ""um pouco melhores do que lixo"".

A França, por exemplo, forneceu veículos blindados AMX-10RC, também designados por tanques blindados ligeiros. No entanto, as origens deste tanque remontam ao início da década de 1980 e a sua última atualização foi em 2000.

O Exército francês começou a desmantelar estes tanques em 2021, depois de terem sido considerados insustentáveis para a guerra moderna. Quando estes tanques foram destacados para a operação militar especial, as Forças Armadas russas ficaram felizes por ajudar a França a terminar o processo de desmantelamento.

Os carros de combate Challenger-2 fornecidos à Ucrânia também estavam no final do seu ciclo de serviço e tiveram zero efeito no campo de batalha, segundo o relatório.

A National Interest acrescentou que a promessa dos EUA de fornecer mais de 30 carros de combate M1 Abrams causou euforia em Kiev, mas ninguém reparou na observação de que a versão moderna e atualizada dos carros de combate Abrams não estava disponível.

Desta mesma forma, os sobrevalorizados caças F-16 prometidos a Kiev também não realizarão alterações no campo de batalha, uma vez que estão no fim do seu ciclo de vida, enquanto a Rússia tem jatos de quinta geração que poderão destruir os aviões de guerra dos EUA com pouco esforço.

A situação faz com que os colunistas se questionem se o conflito na Ucrânia não será apenas um mero negócio para os governos ocidentais, enquanto as vidas do povo ucraniano são utilizadas como dinheiro simbólico.

""Uma pessoa cínica pode concluir que isto foi propositado, parte de um plano maior para drenar os arsenais ocidentais de plataformas de armas consideradas obsoletas, para forçar estes governos a comprar sistemas mais caros e modernos aos empreiteiros de defesa do Ocidente"", escreveu a revista.

No entanto, é pouco provável que mesmo o armamento ocidental de primeira qualidade possa alterar a maré do conflito, uma vez que os militares ucranianos não estão treinados para o utilizar adequadamente.

Desde o início das hostilidades, as autoridades russas têm alertado o Ocidente contra o envio de fornecimentos militares para a Ucrânia, sublinhando que estes apenas alimentam e prolongam o conflito, sendo incapazes de afetar o rumo da operação militar especial.

""A decisão do regime de [o Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr] Zelensky de deixar de transportar petróleo à Hungria e Eslováquia demonstra uma vez mais a incapacidade de Kyiv para negociar e a sua inclinação para chantagens triviais"", disse em conferência de imprensa Andrei Nastasin, um dos porta-vozes do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros (MNE) russo.

Acrescentou ainda que o trânsito de recursos energéticos através da Ucrânia ""converteu-se numa alavanca de manipulação para o regime de Kiev, cujas ações nessa direção são incentivadas pelo Ocidente"".

Segundo Nastasin, ""os patrões de Zelensky colocaram como objetivo o fim definitivo da cooperação energética da Rússia com aqueles países europeus, que no entanto são guiados pelos seus próprios interesses nacionais e considerações económicas racionais"".

O diplomata assinalou que ""a nova escalada de pressão jurídica contra a Lukoil"" coincidiu com uma série de iniciativas diplomáticas de Budapeste para a rápida resolução do conflito na Ucrânia, e com a recusa da Hungria e Eslováquia em apoiarem novas sanções da União Europeia (UE) contra a Rússia.

O porta-voz do MNE russo recordou que a Ucrânia é um país candidato à União Europeia (UE) e sublinhou que Kiev, ""com as suas ações demenciais, ameaça a segurança energética de dois Estados-membros da UE e, decerto, outros países membros e candidatos"".

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Hungria, Péter Szijjártó, acusou na terça-feira a Comissão Europeia de orquestrar a interrupção do fornecimento de petróleo russo para o bloco através da Ucrânia, e alertou que a disputa pode implicar uma crise energética.

Em mensagem na rede social Facebook, Szijjártó emitiu duras críticas ao órgão executivo da União Europeia (UE), ao considerar que ""nada fez"" desde que Budapeste a Bratislava pediram que interviesse neste contencioso em torno da entrega de crude.

""Apesar das ameaças à segurança energética de dois Estados-membros da UE ... Bruxelas permanece em silêncio"", escreveu Szijjártó, para acrescentar que a Comissão Europeia ou revela demasiada ""fraqueza"" para proteger os interesses da Eslováquia e Hungria, ou ""foi Bruxelas, e não Kiev, quem inventou tudo isto"".

Eu diria astuto, semicerrado, cínico, um sorriso maligno do Ocidente político. Bem, finalmente, todo o mundo viu! Tenho vindo a falar sobre isso há anos e fui rotulado como inimigo. Eu disse que não existe amizade! Existe uma parceria, mas é sempre temporária e deve sempre basear-se em alguma coisa, mas em que pode basear-se uma parceria?

Spivak enfatizou que a parceria baseia-se em interesses comuns e só existe desde que esses interesses coincidam.

Assim, os interesses conjuntos, isto é, os interesses dos Estados Unidos da América, como líder do Ocidente global em relação à Ucrânia em guerra, estão a chegar ao fim, todos os interesses estão praticamente alcançados - eles concretizaram 80% dos seus interesses; 20% não, porque se enganaram politicamente, enganaram-se estrategicamente, quando voltaram, em 2022, a não evitar toda esta loucura, embora, provavelmente, pudessem ter-se sentado e conversado.

O político observou que a derrota da Federação Russa na guerra da Ucrânia nunca foi o objetivo dos Estados Unidos, porque a Federação Russa é uma das cinco potências que possuem armas nucleares e, com a premonição de derrota, pode muito bem usar este trunfo, algo que os Estados Unidos não gostariam.

Qualquer potência nuclear, especialmente aquela que possui quase 6000 ogivas nucleares, terá sempre um último cartucho para evitar a derrota estratégica, e esse cartucho será nuclear. E, então, o mundo chegará à terceira guerra mundial.

Portanto, os americanos não estavam interessados na derrota estratégica da Rússia até ao colapso, mas numa longa guerra de atrito e claros erros de cálculo e esperanças no colapso da economia russa, ou no seu sério abalo, e, como resultado, no abalo das torres do Kremlin e numa possível mudança de poder - esta estratégia falhou.

A Rússia acabou por verificar-se uma economia forte, com parceiros muito fortes e consistentes, e talvez futuros aliados estratégicos.

Ao mesmo tempo, afirmou que os restantes objetivos dos EUA nesta guerra foram alcançados. E os americanos implementaram tudo o resto! A Europa é “multiplicada por zero” como rival geopolítica e concorrente em mercados, influência, economia, etc. E está a ver a luz a propósito! A Europa não é objeto de disputas geopolíticas, ouve-se cada vez mais - Washington, Pequim, Moscovo, o Sul global - não existe Europa!

Espanha detém três pessoas por ataques cibernéticos contra países que apoiam a Ucrânia

A polícia espanhola deteve, este sábado (20), três pessoas acusadas de terem participado em ataques cibernéticos de um grupo pró-Rússia contra instituições públicas e setores estratégicos do país e outros membros da NATO.

Os ataques foram dirigidos contra países que apoiam a Ucrânia na sua luta contra a invasão russa, iniciada em fevereiro de 2024.

Dois dos suspeitos foram detidos em Huelva e Sevilha, no sul de Espanha, enquanto o terceiro foi detido nas ilhas Baleares, informou um comunicado da Guarda Civil.

Foram detidos por “crimes de danos informáticos para fins terroristas”. As três pessoas terão participado em ataques organizados pelo grupo de hackers ligado à Rússia “NoName057(16)”, segundo o comunicado.

“A principal atividade deste grupo é a realização de ataques de negação de serviços distribuídos (DDoS) contra sites de organizações públicas e privadas dos setores governamentais, infraestruturas críticas e serviços essenciais”, afirmou a Guarda Civil.

O organismo de segurança detalhou que a principal atividade do grupo consistia na organização de ataques DDoS com “software desenvolvido pelo próprio grupo (…), batizado como DDoSia” e que pode ser “utilizado voluntariamente por indivíduos que apoiam os propósitos desta organização”.

A declaração da Guarda Civil indicava ainda que o objetivo do grupo era responder às “ações hostis e abertamente antirrussas dos russofóbicos ocidentais”.

Em meados de Junho, os sites do governo suíço sofreram uma onda de ataques DDoS antes de uma cimeira de paz na Ucrânia, numa operação reivindicada pelo NoName057(16).

O ataque teve como alvo os portais do governo federal e das organizações participantes na cimeira de paz, segundo Berna.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Serguei Lavrov, confirmou que um grupo de politólogos e especialistas do seu país e dos Estados Unidos mantiveram conversações secretas para discutir saídas para a guerra da Ucrânia.

A existência deste grupo tinha sido revelada pela Folha em março, a partir de conversas em Moscovo com pessoas com conhecimento das negociações. As negociações duraram pouco mais de um ano. Segundo o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, não levaram a lado nenhum.

""Tivemos contactos antes não divulgados com americanos através de politólogos que conheciam e compreendiam as políticas dos seus governos"", afirmou o diplomata em Nova Iorque, na quarta-feira (17), onde conduz sessões do Conselho de Segurança da ONU, que está sob a presidência rotativa dos russos este mês.

Não se estendeu sobre os temas debatidos, mas confirmou que um deles foi o estatuto dos russos étnicos dentro da Ucrânia, uma das queixas do governo de Vladimir Putin - antes da guerra, a administração Volodimir Zelenski fez passar leis limitando por exemplo o uso do língua russa no sistema educacional.

Tal como o Folha tinha noticiado, as conversas eram sempre sobre itens específicos que poderiam fazer parte de eventuais acordos de paz. Uma espécie de triagem daquilo que era ou não aceitável de lado a lado, sublinhando que não havia ucranianos a participar nos encontros.

Tanto o Kremlin como o governo de Joe Biden autorizaram os encontros, ainda que sem carácter oficial. No encontro mais recente, no início do ano, em Istambul (Turquia), os especialistas debateram questões como a neutralidade da Ucrânia, uma das reivindicações de Putin para pôr fim à invasão que tinha disparado em 2022.

Lavrov não disse se participou em algum encontro sobre o tema. Em abril do ano passado, o canal de TV norte-americano NBC disse que o mesmo tinha participado em conversas, também secretas, com antigos funcionários da área da defesa e segurança nacional em Nova Iorque.

As únicas negociações oficiais sobre a guerra ocorreram no início do conflito, na Bielorrússia e na Turquia, envolvendo delegações da Rússia e da Ucrânia. Chegaram a produzir um documento detalhando os termos então favoráveis ao Kremlin para a paz, mas desandaram com o crescente apoio ocidental a Kiev e o sucesso militar em repelir os russos do cerco à capital.

O russo, decano da grande diplomacia mundial, tornou-se um dos principais porta-vozes da política de Putin. Quando o presidente conquistou o seu quinto mandato, em março deste ano, surgiram rumores de que Lavrov iria abandonar o cargo, que ocupa desde 2004, em favor de um dos seus mais poderosos adjuntos, Serguei Riabkov, mas tal não veio a concretizar-se.

O Hospital de Pronto Socorro de Canoas, na região metropolitana de Porto Alegre, foi evacuado por causa de uma inundação que atingiu a cidade este sábado, 4. O presidente da Câmara, Jairo Jorge, deu uma entrevista à imprensa ao final da manhã deste domingo, 5, e falou da situação dramática que o local vive com a pior inundação de que há registo.

""É uma situação dramática. Há muita gente ainda à espera dos resgates. São centenas de voluntários, além de homens do Exército, Polícia Civil, Brigada Militar e Guarda Municipal. A nossa prioridade é salvar vidas"", disse o autarca.

A cidade de Canoas tem 49 centros de acolhimento aos afetados. A estimativa, de acordo com o autarca, é que 20 mil pessoas estejam provisoriamente abrigadas nestes locais. Colchões, roupa de cama, materiais de higiene e alimentos não perecíveis são prioridades, como donativos, neste momento.

A cidade de Canoas, na região metropolitana de Porto Alegre, é uma das mais afetadas pelas cheias. Entre os bairros mais atingidos estão:

O campus da Universidade Luterana do Brasil (ULBRA) também está a prestar atenção às pessoas desalojadas.

Numa transmissão nas redes sociais na manhã deste sábado, o governador Eduardo Leite (PSDB) destacou a situação crítica de Canoas. Segundo disse, a água afetou os geradores do hospital e prejudicou o abastecimento de energia.

Crianças resgatas sem as suas famílias, segundo a autarquia, estão a ser encaminhadas para o Hospital Universitário. Canoas é a terceira cidade gaúcha mais populosa, com 357,7 mil habitantes, atrás de Porto Alegre e Caxias do Sul.

Dos 497 concelhos do distrito, 300 foram afetados pelos temporais. Em Porto Alegre, o nível do Rio Guaíba bateu um nível recorde, inundou ruas do centro histórico e a estação rodoviária, além de obrigar vários moradores a sair de casa. O Aeroporto Salgado Filho suspendeu as operações.

A posição geográfica do Rio Grande do Sul, entre as áreas tropicais e as polares, favorece a ocorrência de eventos climáticos extremos, que têm-se tornado mais intensos e frequentes com o agravamento do aquecimento global. Os especialistas alertam que os efeitos da crise climática far-se-ão sentir com cada vez mais força no Brasil, nos próximos anos.

A Rússia advertiu esta quarta-feira (23) a Coreia do Sul pelo seu envolvimento no conflito da Ucrânia, após a divulgação de informações sobre o suposto envio de tropas norte-coreanas ao território russo.

“Acreditamos que as autoridades sul-coreanas não deveriam fazer o jogo do regime de Kiev”, disse a porta-voz do Ministério das Relações Exteriores da Rússia, Maria Zakharova.

A diplomata fez um apelo a Seul para não se deixar levar pela “histeria anti-russa” e para pensar nas “consequências para a segurança da Coreia do Sul” do seu envolvimento no conflito ucraniano.

“A Rússia reagirá com dureza a qualquer medida que possa representar uma ameaça à segurança do país e dos seus cidadãos, onde quer que estejam”, acrescentou.

Nesse sentido, Zakharova também expressou esperança na “prudência e bom senso das autoridades de Seul”.

Pela sua parte, o Serviço de Inteligência Militar ucraniano (GUR) ofereceu, hoje, através de uma mensagem publicada em coreano, aos soldados norte-coreanos que estariam a treinar em território russo para se juntarem às tropas do Kremlin, a possibilidade de receberem proteção na Ucrânia, caso conseguissem escapar.

Segundo denunciou a inteligência sul-coreana esta quarta-feira, a Coreia do Norte já enviou 3000 soldados para a Rússia, onde estão a treinar para se juntarem às tropas russas que lutam na Ucrânia.

De acordo com informações de inteligência reivindicadas por Seul e Kiev, Pyongyang decidiu enviar até 12 mil soldados para se juntarem ao Exército russo.

O ""jogo"" da NATO pode descontrolar-se e conduzir ao desastre, disse, em entrevista à Sputnik, Yulia Zhdanova, chefe interina da delegação russa nas negociações em Viena sobre segurança militar e controlo de armas.

""Na realidade, a NATO tem vindo a preparar-se há muito tempo para um potencial confronto armado com a Rússia"", disse Zhdanova.

Segundo a mesma, ""os planos regionais de 'defesa' foram aprovados pela NATO, foram formuladas tarefas específicas para todos os comandos militares do bloco"", além disso estão a ser verificadas as rotas logísticas de transferência de tropas e armas através do Atlântico para o ""flanco oriental"".

Também têm sido constantemente treinadas as possíveis opções para o conflito com a Rússia – do Ártico ao Mar Negro.

""Entretanto, estão a ser dados passos muito provocatórios na direção ucraniana – a retórica sobre um possível envio de tropas da NATO para a Ucrânia continua (aqui, aliás, a França está novamente a mostrar zelo). Este 'jogo' pode sair fora do controlo e levar a um conflito com consequências desastrosas. Alertamos claramente para isso nas plataformas diplomáticas internacionais"", acrescentou a diplomata.

Zhdanova acrescentou que os representantes em Viena dos países do Sul Global demonstram um profundo interesse pela posição russa sobre a situação na zona da operação especial.

Segundo ela, a delegação russa em Viena não tem qualquer ilusão de que as estruturas internacionais, incluindo a OSCE, possam ter alguma reação adequada aos crimes do Exército ucraniano, com o apoio de uma série de países ocidentais, mas, para a diplomacia russa, tal não é um obstáculo para encobrir a situação real, tanto na área da operação especial como na região de Kursk. ""Especialmente desde que os Estados do Sul Global, representados noutras plataformas de Viena, mostram um profundo interesse pela posição russa"", disse Zhdanova.

Anteriormente, a diplomata tinha afirmado que a liderança da OSCE nunca condenou o ataque do Exército da Ucrânia na região de Kursk.

PT_57.txt,Other,Other,"Airbus diz que frota global pode atingir os 48.230 aviões nos próximos 20 anos

Empresa diz que procura será impulsionada pelos aviões de fuselagem larga

A Airbus reviu em alta, esta segunda-feira, a previsão da procura de aviões para os próximos 20 anos, avança a Reuters. De acordo com a agência, que cita um relatório anual sobre as tendências da indústria, a frota global pode atingir os 48.230 aviões nos próximos 20 anos, ou seja, pode mais do que duplicar.

Segundo o documento, o maior construtor de aviões do mundo previu a entrega de 42.430 novos aviões nos próximos 20 anos, incluindo 41.490 aviões de passageiros, com um aumento de 4% em ambos os valores desde o estudo anterior.

O relatório surge numa altura em que se espera que o A321XLR de corredor único e longo alcance do fabricante de aviões obtenha a certificação nos próximos dias.

Já a Boeing - que se tem visto envolvida em várias polémicas nos últimos tempo - está a desenvolver uma versão de longo alcance do 737 MAX.

As previsões da Airbus baseiam-se, segundo a Reuters, em previsões económicas que sugerem que 1,7 mil milhões de pessoas entrarão na classe média, com algum rendimento disponível para viajar de avião, nos próximos 20 anos.

""Prevemos um crescimento particularmente forte na Ásia e no Médio Oriente, liderado sobretudo pela Índia e pela China. O tráfego doméstico da China ultrapassará o dos Estados Unidos"", afirmou Bob Lange, responsável pela análise de mercado e previsões da Airbus.

Os dados da Airbus sublinharam a mudança de atenção para a Índia, com três fluxos de tráfego de crescimento mais rápido a servirem o subcontinente indiano.

No entanto, as previsões de crescimento da aviação após a pandemia colocaram a indústria em desacordo com os grupos ambientalistas que contestam o seu historial no combate às alterações climáticas.

""Perigoso. Muito perigoso"", comentou aos jornalistas o líder da Casa Branca, depois de votar antecipadamente em Wilmington, no estado de Delaware, para as presidenciais nos Estados Unidos, que vão determinar o seu sucessor.

Pouco antes, o Departamento de Defesa norte-americano americano tinha anunciado que cerca de dez mil militares da Coreia do Norte foram enviados para treinar na Rússia e combater na Ucrânia nas próximas semanas.

""Estamos cada vez mais preocupados com a intenção da Rússia de utilizar estes soldados em combate ou para apoiar operações de combate contra as forças ucranianas na região russa de Kursk"", disse a porta-voz do Pentágono aos jornalistas.

Sabrina Singh recordou que o secretário da Defesa norte-americano, Lloyd Austin, já tinha avisado publicamente que, caso os soldados da Coreia do Norte fossem utilizados no campo de batalha, seriam considerados beligerantes e alvos legítimos, com sérias implicações para a segurança na região do Indo-Pacífico.

Austin vai ter um encontro com os responsáveis da Defesa da Coreia do Sul no final desta semana no Pentágono, no qual se espera que seja discutido o uso de soldados norte-coreanos no conflito da Ucrânia.

Na manhã de hoje, a NATO afirmou que algumas das tropas norte-coreanas já foram enviadas para a região fronteiriça de Kursk, onde a Rússia tem tentado repelir uma incursão ucraniana iniciada no passado verão.

O secretário-geral da NATO, Mark Rutte, defendeu que este destacamento representa ""uma escalada significativa"" no envolvimento da Coreia do Norte no conflito e marca ""uma perigosa expansão da guerra da Rússia"", iniciada com a invasão da Ucrânia em fevereiro de 2022.

O secretário-geral indicou que a Aliança Atlântica está a ""consultar ativamente"" os países da organização, a Ucrânia e os parceiros do Indo-Pacífico sobre estes desenvolvimentos e que iria falar em breve com o Presidente da Coreia do Sul e com o ministro da Defesa de Kiev.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, ignorou os comentários de Rutte e observou que Pyongyang e Moscovo assinaram um pacto de segurança conjunto em junho passado, mas não chegou a confirmar que os soldados norte-coreanos estavam na Rússia.

Lavrov argumentou que instrutores militares ocidentais já foram enviados secretamente para a Ucrânia para ajudar os seus militares a utilizar armas de longo alcance fornecidas pelos parceiros ocidentais.

A Ucrânia, cujas defesas estão sob forte pressão russa na região oriental de Donetsk, poderá receber mais notícias inquietantes no seguimento das presidenciais norte-americanas da próxima semana, em que uma vitória do republicano Donald Trump sobre a atual vice-Presidente, a democrata Kamala Harris, poderá levar a uma diminuição da ajuda militar de Washington.

O Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, citando relatórios dos serviços de informação, afirmou na passada sexta-feira que as tropas norte-coreanas estariam no campo de batalha dentro de alguns dias.

A Associação Nacional de Revendedores de Combustíveis (ANAREC) manifestou esta sexta-feira ""profundo desagrado e crescente preocupação"" face à intenção do Governo em continuar a descongelar a atualização da taxa de carbono, uma das medidas inscritas na proposta de Orçamento do Estado para 2025.

""Esta subida da taxa de carbono tem um forte impacto nos preços finais dos combustíveis que são pagos pelo consumidor final, arrecadando o Estado mais receita fiscal"", considerou a ANAREC, sublinhando que o aumento da taxa de carbono reflete-se ainda com maior incidência no gás de botija, que é um bem essencial a uma grande percentagem de famílias portuguesas, nomeadamente em zonas do país onde não há outra alternativa"".

Sete dias antes da entrega do OE 2025 no Parlamento, a 3 de outubro, a associação que representa as gasolineiras teve uma audiência na Secretaria de Estado dos Assuntos Fiscais, na qual entrou um memorando que reforça ""a necessidade urgente de redução da elevada carga fiscal que incide sobre os combustíveis líquidos e gasosos, nomeadamente, no que diz respeito ao ISP e taxa de carbono"".

""A atual carga fiscal nos combustíveis representa 47% no preço final do gasóleo simples, e 52% no preço final da gasolina simples, sendo que o Governo pretende aumentar ainda mais os impostos, já em 2025"", refere a associação em comunicado, pedindo que o Governo reveja reveja a sua posição quanto ao descongelamento da atualização da taxa de carbono.

Do lado do Governo, este optou por ignorar as exigências de Bruxelas e vai mesmo prolongar os descontos ao Imposto sobre os Produtos Petrolíferos (ISP) que ainda estão em vigor – e que evitam que os preços da gasolina e gasóleo subam para perto dos dois euros por litro.

Ao Negócios, fonte oficial das Finanças garantiu que estes apoios vão manter-se em 2025, não estando prevista no Orçamento do Estado ""nenhuma alteração ao ISP"". Em causa está uma redução do imposto equivalente à descida do IVA de 23% para 13% e também a devolução da receita adicional de IVA via ISP, medidas que até agosto custaram ao Estado perto de 500 e 190 milhões de euros, respetivamente.

Apesar desta manutenção, em 2025 a receita fiscal via ISP vai bater todos os recordes. Serão quase 4,2 mil milhões de euros, mais 22% face aos 3,4 mil milhões de euros previstos para este ano.

Um boto-cor-de-rosa com 4 metros de comprimento, feito pelo artista plástico Gil Reais, foi o protagonista da primeira ação de protesto do Brasil na COP28, no Dubai, realizada este domingo (3).

A iniciativa, intitulada “Boto Alerta: Queremos nadar na água, não no petróleo!”, foi feita pela organização juvenil Engajamundo, em parceria com a Greenpeace Brasil, na Zona Azul da conferência do clima da ONU.

O objetivo foi denunciar os impactos socioambientais que a exploração de petróleo na região Amazónica pode causar, um dos temas que está a turvar a presença brasileira primeira COP do governo Lula.

Protesto do Brasil na COP28 inspirado na morte de golfinhos

A inspiração para a escultura foi a morte dos golfinhos impactados pela seca severa do último período, representando a fauna e a exploração petrolífera na Bacia da Foz do rio Amazonas.

Para Marcelo Laterman, porta-voz da Greenpeace Brasil, a ação realizada em parceria com o Engajamundo denuncia a contradição do governo brasileiro em defender a expansão das fronteiras petrolíferas no país, sobretudo em áreas sensíveis como a Amazónia, ao mesmo tempo que procura reposicionar o país num papel de protagonismo na agenda climática.

“De forma criativa, estes jovens ativistas dão uma mensagem importante: não há futuro virtuoso para a Amazónia com o avanço do petróleo na região. A abertura desta nova fronteira pode ficar marcada como o pior legado socioambiental do Presidente Lula. É necessário que o governo cumpra com o que prometeu e defenda a Amazónia, os seus povos e enfrente a crise climática de forma responsável”.

Entre 2012 e 2020, segundo a Engajamundo, o número de campos petrolíferos na Amazónia aumentou 13% e, caso haja a abertura desta nova fronteira na costa amazónica, este número vai aumentar exponencialmente.

O Brasil é o 9.º maior produtor de petróleo do mundo. A Engajamundo e a Greenpeace criticam a entrada do Basil como observador na OPEP+ (Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo), em plena COP28, ”que mostra que o país e os seus líderes ainda têm o petróleo como prioridade económica, apesar dos discursos em defesa da descarbonização”.

Jaciara Borari é uma das ativistas indígenas do Engajamundo e faz parte da delegação que montou esta ação.

“Queremos que, de alguma forma, o protesto na COP28 expresse a urgência desta agenda chegar aos decisores, e que o processo de exploração de petróleo na Bacia da Foz do rio Amazonas seja repensado e barrado.

“Ainda vamos a tempo de evitar um grande desastre anunciado!”, alerta a ativista.

PT_285.txt,Other,Other,"Borrell diz que fim das restrições às armas na Ucrânia facilitaria paz

Numa publicação na rede social X, o Alto Representante da União Europeia (UE) para os Negócios Estrangeiros e Política de Segurança refere-se à ofensiva ucraniana na região russa de Kursk, em curso há mais de duas semanas, como “um duro golpe para a narrativa do Presidente russo, [Vladimir] Putin”.

Borrell afirma que “o levantamento das restrições à utilização das capacidades contra os militares russos envolvidos na agressão contra a Ucrânia, em conformidade com o direito internacional, teria vários efeitos importantes”.

Entre estes, aponta o reforço da autodefesa ucraniana, “acabando com o santuário da Rússia para os seus ataques e bombardeamentos de cidades e infraestruturas ucranianas”, além de sustentar que tal decisão permitiria “salvar vidas e reduzir a destruição na Ucrânia”, bem como “ajudar a fazer avançar os esforços de paz”.

Vários países ocidentais que apoiam a Ucrânia, nomeadamente Estados Unidos, Alemanha, França e Reino Unido, têm recusado que armas de longo alcance sejam utilizadas para ataques em território russo, com receio de uma escalada do conflito entre a Rússia e a NATO.

Esta semana, o Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, afirmou que a incursão em Kursk não teria sido necessária se os parceiros estrangeiros da Ucrânia tivessem levantado as restrições de uso das suas armas de longo alcance contra a Rússia.

No início de agosto, o Exército ucraniano lançou um ataque terrestre em Kursk através da região ucraniana de Sumi, situada na fronteira.

Após várias semanas de ofensiva, Kiev afirma ter assumido o controlo de quase 100 localidades e mais de 1.250 quilómetros quadrados de território russo.

Moscovo, por seu lado, garante que dará uma resposta contundente a esta ofensiva ucraniana, a primeira desde o início da guerra.

O Alto Representante da diplomacia dos 27 do bloco europeu afirma ainda, na publicação de hoje na rede social X, que “a UE apoia plenamente a luta da Ucrânia contra a agressão russa”, uma mensagem que afirma ter transmitido ao ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros ucraniano, Dmytro Kuleba.

Volodymyr Zelensky diz que a Ucrânia controla 74 localidades russas - ou cerca de mil quilómetros quadrados - na região de Kursk. A informação foi avançada pelo Presidente ucraniano nas redes sociais.

Oleksandr Syrskyi, chefe do exército da Ucrânia, explica que “há batalhas a decorrer ao longo de toda a linha de frente”. “Apesar da alta intensidade dos combates, a situação está sob nosso controlo”.

O Presidente ucraniano diz-se confiante com a maior intervenção em território russo desde o início da guerra e afirma que Putin “tem de ser forçado à paz”.

“É inteiramente justificado destruir os terroristas russos onde quer que estejam, os aeródromos militares russos, a logística russa. Vemos os benefícios que isto pode trazer para alcançar a paz. A Rússia precisa de ser forçada a chegar à paz, especialmente se Putin quer tanto lutar (…) A Rússia levou a guerra a outros, agora a guerra regressa a casa”, afirma o Presidente ucraniano.

Análise: ""Estamos a assistir à História em direto""

A Casa Branca, dos Estados Unidos, defende a posição da Ucrânia, afirmando que Kiev tem direito a atacar dentro da Rússia..

John Kirby, o porta-voz do Conselho de Segurança Nacional dos EUA, diz que, se Putin está preocupado com a incursão em Kusk, então deve parar a guerra.

Putin: Ucrânia “recusou propostas” de “plano pacífico”

O Presidente da Rússia, por sua vez, afirmou esta segunda-feira que deixou de fazer sentido manter conversações com a liderança de Kiev na sequência da incursão militar ucraniana, e prometeu uma “resposta firme”.

""Torna-se agora claro que o regime e Kiev recusaram as nossas propostas para o regresso a um plano de acordo pacífico"", disse Putin. ""O inimigo, com a ajuda dos seus chefes ocidentais, está agora a efetuar a sua aposta, e o Ocidente mantém uma guerra contra nós utilizando-se dos ucranianos para melhorar a sua posição negocial no futuro"", indicou, citado pela agência Tass.

Contudo, enfatizou que manter conservações com um Governo ""que ataca civis"" não faz sentido. ""Mas de que negociações podemos falar agora? Que poderemos falar com eles?"", questionou, para acrescentar que a Rússia se prepara para uma resposta firme às ações da Ucrânia e alcançará todos os objetivos estabelecidos.

As forças ucranianas desencadearam na passada terça-feira uma incursão de assinalável amplitude na região fronteiriça russa de Kursk, a mais importante desde a invasão em larga escala da Ucrânia pelas forças russas em fevereiro de 2022.

Na perspetiva de Putin, outro dos objetivos da incursão ucraniana na região de Kursk consiste em travar a ofensiva de Moscovo no leste e sul da Ucrânia.

Os seis ativistas do movimento Climáximo, que bloquearam um jato privado no aeródromo de Cascais em 2023, foram, esta segunda-feira, condenados a pena suspensa de 15 meses de prisão, 135 dias de trabalho comunitário e ao pagamento de 5.300,59 euros.

O grupo ambientalista, numa nota enviada às redações, indicou que a leitura da sentença decorreu esta segunda-feira de manhã, no “mesmo mês em que a temperatura bateu o recorde mundial por duas vezes consecutivas”. sete meses, enquanto os governos e as empresas fósseis se reuniam na COP28, para a qual voaram em massa de jato privado para mais uma ronda de falsas promessas, apoiantes do Climáximo entraram no aeródromo de Cascais, pintaram um jato privado com tinta vermelha e bloquearam-no com os seus corpos”,

Os seis ativistas foram julgados por, em dezembro de 2023, bloquearem um jato privado no aeródromo de Cascais, para denunciar os “voos supérfluos e de luxo dos super-ricos, e o uso destas armas de destruição maciça, cujas emissões estão a matar pessoas por todo o mundo”.

O Climáximo relembra que, “há sete meses, enquanto os governos e as empresas fósseis se reuniam na COP28, para a qual voaram em massa de jato privado para mais uma ronda de falsas promessas, apoiantes do Climáximo entraram no aeródromo de Cascais, pintaram um jato privado com tinta vermelha e bloquearam-no com os seus corpos”.

O grupo reforça que esta sentença não intimida os seus apoiantes, “nem irá travar a luta”.

Uma das ativistas condenadas, citada no comunicado do grupo, lamentou que “hoje, apesar da admissão em tribunal da gravidade da crise climática e do impacto de protestos disruptivos, as pessoas que tomaram ação para parar a destruição foram condenadas, enquanto os verdadeiros culpados permanecem impunes”.

O objetivo dos exercícios nucleares da NATO é a preparação para uma guerra nuclear limitada na Europa, com ataques de bombas aéreas nucleares táticas dos EUA por aviões das forças aéreas nacionais da NATO, em alvos na Rússia, disse à Sputnik Igor Korotchenko, editor-chefe da revista russa Natsionalnaya Oborona (Defesa Nacional).

O secretário-geral da NATO, Mark Rutte, anunciou na quinta-feira (10) que os exercícios nucleares anuais da aliança, Steadfast Noon, terão início na segunda-feira (14). As manobras decorrerão sobretudo no Reino Unido, Mar do Norte, Bélgica e Países Baixos.

""Os exercícios envolvem a prática de procedimentos relacionados com a transferência de instalações de armazenamento para a força aérea de vários Estados-membros da NATO de bombas nucleares táticas americanas B61-13, armazenadas em aeródromos de vários países da NATO e sob controlo americano. Na simulação de um conflito nuclear com a Rússia e de uma guerra nuclear limitada na Europa, as bombas aéreas são transferidas para as forças aéreas nacionais dos países membros da NATO envolvidos"", explicou Korotchenko.

Segundo o mesmo, os exercícios incluirão a aquisição de tarefas de combate e planos de ataque contra instalações no território russo ao longo de toda a sua fronteira com os países da NATO.

""Todos estes procedimentos têm um objetivo – uma guerra nuclear limitada na Europa, com a utilização de ataques reais utilizando armas nucleares táticas dos EUA por aviões das forças aéreas nacionais dos países da NATO, em alvos no território da Rússia"", disse Korotchenko.

Ao mesmo tempo, o analista acredita que, no caso de um ataque real com armas nucleares táticas dos EUA no território da Rússia, mesmo às mãos dos aliados europeus dos EUA, deve ser realizado um ataque nuclear limitado no território dos EUA.

Segundo os serviços de segurança ucranianos (SBU), cinco pessoas foram acusadas e uma delas foi detida quando tentava atravessar a fronteira ucraniana e incorrem numa pena até 12 anos de prisão.

A investigação surge no momento em que Kyiv tenta reprimir a corrupção, numa tentativa de acelerar a sua adesão à União Europeia e à NATO, uma das condições impostas pelos parceiros europeus.

O Presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelenskyy foi eleito com base numa plataforma anticorrupção em 2019, muito antes da invasão total da Ucrânia pela Rússia em fevereiro de 2022. Tanto o Presidente como os seus assessores têm apresentado os recentes despedimentos de altos funcionários, nomeadamente Ivan Bakanov, antigo chefe do Serviço de Segurança do Estado, em julho de 2022, como prova dos seus esforços para reprimir a corrupção.

Os responsáveis pela segurança afirmam que a atual investigação remonta a agosto de 2022, quando os funcionários assinaram um contrato de aquisição de cartuchos de artilharia no valor de 1,5 mil milhões de hryvnias (37 milhões de euros) com a empresa de armamento Lviv Arsenal.

Depois de receberem o pagamento, os funcionários da empresa deveriam transferir os fundos para uma empresa registada no estrangeiro, que depois entregaria as munições.

No entanto, os bens nunca foram entregues e o dinheiro foi enviado para várias contas na Ucrânia e nos Balcãs, segundo os investigadores.

A Procuradoria-Geral da Ucrânia afirma que os fundos foram entretanto apreendidos e serão devolvidos ao orçamento da defesa do país.

Entretanto, hoje a Ucrânia denunciou uma vaga de ataques russos às suas infraestruturas em várias regiões do país e a Rússia anunciou que repeliu novos avanços ucranianos em Kharkiv e Donetsk.

Zaporijia foi uma das regiões mais afetadas, tendo sido palco de pelo menos 130 bombardeamentos russos nas últimas 24 horas, de acordo com o chefe da administração regional ucraniana, Yuri Malasko. Pelo menos 24 comunidades foram atingidas por bombardeamentos em 33 ataques de drones.

Outras 15 comunidades na região de Sumy foram atingidas por bombardeamentos russos, de acordo com a administração militar ucraniana na região, numa mensagem também publicada na sua conta do Telegram. ""Noventa e uma explosões foram registadas a nível regional"", segundo as autoridades.

A Rússia, por seu lado, afirmou hoje que as suas forças repeliram cinco ataques e contra-ataques de grupos de assalto de duas brigadas das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia na direção de Kupiansk, perto de Sinkovka, na região de Kharkiv, e de Terniv, em Donetsk.

""As unidades de espingardas motorizadas do grupo, em cooperação com a artilharia, repeliram dois ataques e três contra-ataques dos grupos de assalto da 32.ª brigada mecanizada e da 103.ª brigada de defesa territorial ucraniana nas zonas de Sinkovka e Ternov. Todos os ataques e contra-ataques foram repelidos. O inimigo foi forçado a retirar-se para sul e oeste"", disse o porta-voz militar Sergei Zibinsky à agência de notícias russa TASS.

A libertação da cidade de Toretsk pelas forças russas seria crucial, uma vez que é um ponto de vista estratégico para toda a República Popular de Donetsk (RPD), disse o analista militar Viktor Litovkin à Sputnik.

As forças russas libertaram mais de dois terços da cidade de Toretsk na RPD, disse o chefe regional Denis Pushilin aos meios de comunicação russos. Acrescentou que o bombardeamento ucraniano da cidade de Gorlovka deverá diminuir quando Toretsk for totalmente libertada.

O analista militar Viktor Litovkin explicou à Sputnik que Toretsk é um grande centro de mineração de carvão e tem enormes quantidades de resíduos que se elevam acima das estepes nos seus arredores. O analista e coronel reformado do Exército russo observou que a 70 ou 80 metros de altura, os montes ""podem ser utilizados para garantir a monitorização e o controlo abrangentes de toda esta zona, não apenas com drones, mas também com dispositivos óticos simples"". ""Estas pilhas [de resíduos] podem ser equipadas com posições de tiro para armas de artilharia, atiradores, metralhadoras e, em geral, ser utilizadas como fortalezas para as nossas tropas de assalto"", destacou Litovkin.

A cidade é um importante centro de apoio logístico e tático das forças ucranianas. Assumir o controlo da mesma prejudicaria as hipóteses do Exército ucraniano de trazer reservas e cortaria o seu fornecimento de munições, combustível, lubrificantes e alimentos, enfatizou o especialista.

""Se o abastecimento for interrompido, a linha da frente ficará sem munições, combustível para veículos mecanizados, tanques, veículos blindados de transporte de pessoal e assim por diante"", disse Litovkin.

""O exército ficaria sem munições, imobilizado e começaria a sofrer uma derrota após outra"", levando à ""diminuição da moral entre as suas fileiras"".

""Portanto, o exército pode acabar cercado, talvez completamente eliminado"", disse o coronel na reserva. ""Algumas unidades podem ver a rendição como a sua única hipótese de sobrevivência.""

A libertação de Toretsk abriria o caminho para Snezhnoe, Kramatorsk e para a libertação completa do território da RPD das garras do regime de Kiev, disse o especialista militar.

Kramatorsk era a principal cidade ainda detida pelas forças ucranianas, e a sua captura assinalaria ""a libertação completa da República Popular de Donetsk"", sublinhou Litovkin.

O documento ""Orientações voluntárias para a gestão integrada de incêndios: princípios e ações estratégicas"" atualiza orientações com duas décadas desta agência da ONU (Organização das Nações Unidas) e integra novas recomendações ""para enfrentar os desafios decorrentes da atual crise climática"", refere a organização em comunicado.

Até ao final do século, prevê-se que os incêndios florestais extremos se tornem cerca de 50% mais frequentes e as alterações ambientais ligadas às alterações climáticas, como secas mais frequentes, temperaturas elevadas e ventos fortes, ""irão provavelmente resultar em épocas de incêndios mais quentes, secas e longas"".

Segundo a FAO, cerca de 340 milhões a 370 milhões de hectares da superfície terrestre são queimados anualmente por incêndios florestais, com prejuízos para o desenvolvimento sustentável e para os meios de subsistência das comunidades e originando grandes volumes de emissões de gases com efeito de estufa.

""A forma como respondemos ao desafio dos incêndios florestais é fundamental (...). Devemos mudar o nosso foco das respostas reativas para as estratégias proativas e dar prioridade à prevenção e preparação"", disse citado no comunicado o diretor da Divisão Florestal da FAO, Zhimin Wu, que lançou a nova edição do guia durante a 9. ª Semana Mundial das Florestas, a decorrer em Roma.

O lançamento das orientações atualizadas é ""a atividade de estreia"" do Centro global de gestão de incêndios, criado em 2023 pela FAO e pelo Programa das Nações Unidas para o Ambiente (UNEP), com o apoio dos Estados Unidos, Canadá, França, Alemanha e Portugal, bem como da República da Coreia.

O centro anunciou que já recebeu um financiamento no valor de quase cinco milhões de dólares (4,6 milhões de euros), um ""apoio essencial à sua missão de reduzir os efeitos adversos dos incêndios florestais na sociedade, nas paisagens e no clima"".

O Fórum Económico Mundial (WEF, na sigla inglesa), realizado na semana passada em Davos, na Suíça, foi talvez o menos estelar dos últimos anos, se considerarmos a participação dos chefes de Estado e de Governo. Mas foi também o que mais escancarou a emergência da agenda climática no meio de desafios geopolíticos e socioeconómicos de uma era em alta voltagem de conflitos, em que os líderes mundiais têm mantido os seus diálogos numa Torre de Babel.

Não por coincidência, uma parte substancial do Relatório de Riscos Globais 2024, lançado pelo Fórum pouco antes do encontro, é dedicada às questões do clima e do ambiente. O principal risco apontado nesta edição foi a desinformação, que também se relaciona fortemente com o tema.

Este ano, como membro da rede de especialistas e colíder do Conselho Global sobre o Futuro da Natureza e Segurança do WEF, tive a oportunidade de palestrar, mediar e participar em sessões abertas e fechadas em Davos. Se as atuais guerras em curso dominaram as agendas – não apenas entre Israel e Gaza, e Rússia e Ucrânia, mas as que há anos devastam África e a que podem acontecer no Mar do Sul da China –, as relações entre os conflitos e a deterioração da natureza mostraram de forma cabal a necessidade de um realinhamento global político, económico e tecnológico para combater um inimigo comum: as desigualdades.

Alguns pontos de reflexão trazidos destes dias intensos do Fórum:

1) Multilateralismo desafiado – A multipolaridade para a qual o mundo está a migrar é conceptualmente positiva. Mas, na prática, esta divisão de liderança por vários países está a ocorrer numa altura em que as instituições multilaterais, e a ONU em particular, têm sido enfraquecidas em prol de alianças de interesses que procuram a dominância de grupos económicos, ideológicos, religiosos ou apenas oportunistas. Isto está a minar ainda mais a capacidade de as nações procurarem convergências e agirem de forma conjunta. Como advertiu o secretário-geral da ONU, António Guterres, ""as divisões geopolíticas estão a impedir-nos de nos unirmos em torno de soluções globais para os desafios globais"". O remédio é reforçar a cooperação internacional, nada trivial na atualidade.

2) Natureza financiada – A transição energética e a descarbonização do mundo, que ganharam alento com o compromisso de eliminação gradual dos combustíveis fósseis na COP28, não sairão do campo das boas intenções sem aportes robustos em fundos e soluções financeiras que apoiem a adaptação e a resiliência das comunidades afetadas, e incrementam e compensam a proteção dos ecossistemas, em particular nos países em desenvolvimento. Foram anunciadas algumas iniciativas, mas é assustador perceber que os recentes desastres climáticos, com enormes perdas humanas e comprometimento das atividades económicas, têm sido mais eficazes do que a ciência para catalisar a ação dos decisores. Quantas catástrofes serão ainda necessárias?

Serguei Lavrov confirmou “contactos nunca divulgados” com norte-americanos. Não deram o resultado desejado.

A Rússia teve reuniões secretas com os EUA para tentar acabar com a guerra na Ucrânia.

Serguei Lavrov, ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia, confirmou que um grupo de cientistas políticos e especialistas russos reuniu-se com especialistas norte-americanos.

“Tivemos contactos nunca divulgados até aqui com norte-americanos, através de cientistas políticos que conheciam e entendiam as políticas dos Governos”, anunciou Lavrov à margem do Conselho de Segurança da Organização das Nações Unidas.

A frase é citada esta quinta-feira pelo Folha de S. Paulo, o jornal que em março tinha noticiado essas tentativas de acordo de paz.

As reuniões funcionavam como uma espécie de triagem do que era aceitável por parte dos dois países – mas a Ucrânia nunca teve representantes nesses encontros.

Os Governos da Rússia e dos EUA autorizaram esses encontros, mesmo que não fossem oficiais.

As negociações duraram pouco mais de um ano, mas, ainda segundo o ministro russo, não tiveram o resultado desejado. De nada adiantaram, na prática.

Serguei Lavrov só partilhou mais um tópico abordado nessas reuniões: o estatuto dos russos étnicos dentro da Ucrânia.

Recorde-se que o presidente da Rússia, Vladimir Putin, tinha dito antes da guerra que a cultura russa estava a ser posta de lado na Ucrânia, por exemplo com a lei que limita o uso da língua russa no sistema educacional ucraniano.

Até aqui, só houve encontros oficiais entre russos e ucranianos logo no início da guerra.

Mas, tal como estes, essas negociações, primeiro na Bielorrússia e depois na Turquia, não terminaram com acordo de paz – e nunca mais voltaram a realizar-se.

Os Estados Unidos estão em negociações para aumentar as compras de explosivos à Turquia com o intuito de acelerar a produção de projéteis de artilharia. Segundo os meios de comunicação social, Ancara está no caminho para se tornar o maior vendedor de munições de artilharia a Washington já este ano.

Os fornecimentos turcos de trinitrotolueno, conhecido como TNT, e de nitroguanidina, que é utilizada como propulsor, seriam cruciais na produção de munições de calibre 155 mm, padrão da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO), de acordo com responsáveis familiares com as discussões, ouvidos pela Bloomberg.

O aumento da procura levou a um atraso nas encomendas globais e colocou pressão sobre as cadeias de abastecimento de defesa, especialmente de componentes como o TNT, disseram as autoridades sob anonimato.

O Pentágono disse no final de fevereiro que contratou a General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems para construir três linhas de peças metálicas para projéteis de 155 mm no Texas, incluindo subcontratados turcos. A fábrica, em Mesquite, no Texas, está prevista entrar em atividade em junho, disse a empresa.

Espera-se que as linhas de produção da empresa de defesa turca Repkon produzam cerca de 30% de todos os projéteis de artilharia de 155 mm fabricados nos EUA até 2025, disseram as pessoas.

Numa declaração sobre o investimento no Texas e na indústria turca, o Pentágono disse que trabalhar com os aliados ""é fundamental para construir uma base industrial de defesa global"", noticiam os meios de comunicação social.

Além disso, o Departamento de Defesa comprou 116 mil cartuchos de munições prontas para combate à Arca Defense, da Turquia, para entrega este ano, prevendo-se que novas compras sejam entregues em breve em 2025, acrescentaram os responsáveis.

Os esforços norte-americanos e da Europa fazem parte de uma corrida para alcançar Moscovo, que se encontra em vantagem no campo de batalha e fez com que as tropas ucranianas tivessem de abandonar locais estratégicos após investidas.

O presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, planeia visitar a Casa Branca no dia 9 de maio, pela primeira vez desde que o presidente Joe Biden assumiu o cargo, enquanto os dois suavizam os laços militares.

O acordo com Ancara revela também um equilíbrio delicado entre os aliados da NATO, cujas relações foram tensionadas pela operação russa na Ucrânia e pelo bloqueio de meses da Turquia à adesão da Suécia à Aliança Atlântica.

PT_222.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Itália prepara-se para vaga de calor recorde com alertas em 22 cidades

O Ministério da Saúde de Itália emitiu alertas vermelhos (“bollino rosso”) para 22 cidades, na quarta-feira, enquanto o país se prepara para mais uma intensa vaga de calor. Isto depois de este verão já ter quebrado todos os recordes anteriores de temperaturas extremas.

As pessoas estão a ser aconselhadas a evitar a exposição direta ao sol durante as horas mais quentes do dia e a manter-se hidratadas.

A região do Lácio, que inclui a capital, Roma, lançou um plano de emergência para combater os efeitos do calor intenso na saúde. Isto acontece numa altura em que o número de casos de emergência relacionados com o calor está a aumentar.

Este fenómeno é mais prevalente entre os mais idosos. Dado que uma grande parte da população italiana tem mais de 65 anos, o calor extremo representa um grande risco.

“Os problemas de saúde mais comuns nesta altura do ano incluem o agravamento de doenças crónicas, como problemas cardíacos, arritmias, infeções, além de problemas renais e comportamentais”, diz Giuseppe Famularo, médico do hospital San Camillo-Forlanini, em Roma.

As autoridades também estão preocupadas com aqueles que trabalham ao ar livre. Todos os anos em Itália ocorrem cerca de 4000 lesões relacionadas com o calor nos locais de trabalho.

Os sindicatos, especialmente ligados ao setor da construção, lançaram uma campanha de consciencialização para o problema. Querem também que o Governo implemente novas regras para proteger os trabalhadores.

“Hoje em dia, as questões de saúde, segurança e lesões no local de trabalho têm de ser vistas no contexto atual, que é caracterizado pelas alterações climáticas”, disse Alessandro Genovesi, secretário-geral da Fillea Cgil, a federação que representa os trabalhadores da construção.

“Muito mudou, se compararmos o trabalho no setor da construção há 30 anos com o que é hoje, entre junho e setembro. Um dia de trabalho de oito horas pode ser organizado para incluir seis horas e meia a sete horas de trabalho no verão e oito a nove horas de trabalho no inverno”, acrescentou.

As alterações climáticas causadas pela atividade humana intensificaram os piores eventos extremos dos últimos 20 anos e contribuíram para a morte de 350.000 pessoas, segundo uma análise divulgada hoje pela organização World Weather Attribution (WWA).

A análise sublinha que as alterações climáticas já são “incrivelmente perigosas com um aquecimento de 1,3°C” (graus celsius) e descreve as ações necessárias para salvar vidas face ao agravamento das condições meteorológicas extremas.

A WWA teve em conta a onda de calor na Europa em 2003 (os 47,3ºC na Amareleja), que terá provocado a morte de mais de 70.000 pessoas.

Terá sido, segundo um comunicado da instituição, a “primeira prova inegável de que as alterações climáticas” eram uma realidade que estava a afetar a vida das pessoas e não uma “ameaça abstrata”.

Foi a primeira vez, diz a WWA, que os cientistas identificaram claramente as “impressões digitais” das alterações climáticas num fenómeno meteorológico específico, marcando o início de um novo campo de investigação, conhecido como “ciência da atribuição”.

Na análise dos 10 eventos climáticos mais mortíferos desde a onda de calor de 2003 incluiu-se três ciclones tropicais no Indo-Pacífico (Sidr, Nargis e Haiyan), quatro ondas de calor na Europa, dois fenómenos de precipitação intensa (um na Índia, outro no Mediterrâneo) e uma seca no Corno de África.

“No seu conjunto, estes fenómenos causaram mais de 350.000 mortes. E em todos eles encontramos as impressões digitais das alterações climáticas”, salienta a organização, que adverte que não se contabilizaram centenas de milhares de mortes não reportadas.

E acrescenta: “Sabemos que não existe uma catástrofe natural. É a vulnerabilidade e a exposição da população que transformam os riscos meteorológicos em desastres humanitários”.

Destaca a organização que o facto de o mundo não se afastar dos combustíveis fósseis “está a provocar alterações dramáticas nas condições meteorológicas extremas, contribuindo para centenas de milhares de mortes e afetando milhões de pessoas”.

Os avisos precoces de eventos extremos e mecanismos de ação precoce (evacuações por exemplo) podem ser a diferença entre a vida e a morte.

Mas alguns acontecimentos, nota-se no estudo, ultrapassam a capacidade de qualquer governo se preparar. Quatro dos 10 fenómenos meteorológicos mais mortais foram ondas de calor na Europa, uma região rica e relativamente bem preparada.

Pelo menos 158 pessoas morreram na província espanhola de Valência, numa contagem que ainda não está terminada, na sequência de uma violenta tempestade na terça-feira passada.

As chuvas torrenciais foram 12% mais intensas e duas vezes mais prováveis do que quando o clima ainda não tinha aquecido, segundo a WWA numa análise rápida e preliminar de hoje.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",alteração climática piorar evento extremo contribuir morte alteração climática causar atividade humano intensificar piores evento extrer último ano contribuir morte pessoa análise divulgar hoje organização world Weather attribution wwa análise sublinhar alteração climática incrivelmente perigoso aquecimento grau celsius descrever ação necessário salvar vida face agravamento condição meteorológico extrema wwa conta onda calor Europa amareleja ter provocar morte pessoa ter ser comunicado instituição prova inegável alteração climática ser realidade afetar vida pessoa ameaça abstrato wwa cientista identificar claramente impressão digital alteração climática fenómeno meteorológico específico marcar início campo investigação ciência atribuição análise evento climático mortífero onda calor incluiu-se ciclone tropical indo-pacífico sidr nargis haiyan Ondas calor Europa fenómeno precipitação intenso índia outro mediterrâneo seca corno África conjunto fenómeno causar morte encontrar impressão digital alteração climática salientar organização advertir contabilizar centena milhar morte reportado acrescentar saber existir catástrofe natural vulnerabilidade exposição população transformar risco meteorológico desastr humanitário destacar organização facto mundo afastar combustível fóssil provocar alteração dramático condição meteorológico extrema contribuir centena milhar morte afetar milhão pessoa aviso precoce evento extremo mecanismo ação precoce evacuação diferença vida morte acontecimento nota-se estudo ultrapassar capacidade governo preparar fenómeno meteorológico mortal ondas calor Europa região rico relativamente preparado pessoa morrer província espanhol valência contagem terminada sequência violento tempestade terça-feira passado chuva torrencial intenso provável clima ter aquecir wwa análise rápido preliminar hoje

""Estamos à beira de um desastre climático irreversível"", afirmaram os investigadores num relatório anual sobre o estado do clima, publicado hoje na BioScience.

De acordo com os peritos, grande parte da estrutura da vida na Terra está em perigo.

Apesar dos avisos e das consequências que foi possível prever no último meio século, as emissões de combustíveis fósseis aumentaram para ""um recorde histórico"", referiram no documento.

Os cientistas sublinharam que os três dias mais quentes ocorreram em julho deste ano e que as atuais políticas estão a conduzir a Terra a um pico de aquecimento de aproximadamente 2,7 graus Celsius até 2100.

""Tragicamente, estamos a falhar em evitar impactos sérios (...) Trouxemos o planeta a condições climáticas nunca testemunhadas por nós ou pelos nossos antepassados"", alertaram.

A equipa, dirigida por William Ripple, da Oregon State University, identifica as áreas em que são necessárias mudanças: energia, poluentes, natureza, alimentação e economia.

No ano passado, verificaram-se temperaturas recorde também no mar, assim como o verão extra tropical mais quente do Hemisfério Norte, em 2000 anos.

""As emissões de dióxido de carbono causadas pelo homem e outros gases com efeito de estufa são os principais impulsionadores das mudanças climáticas. Em 2022, a combustão global de combustíveis fósseis e os processos industriais foram responsáveis por cerca de 90% dessas emissões"", sustentaram.

Segundo Ripple, uma grande parte da própria estrutura da vida no planeta está em perigo: ""Já estamos no meio de uma convulsão climática abrupta, que põe em risco a vida na Terra de uma forma nunca vista pelos humanos"".

Em 35 sinais vitais monitorizados anualmente pela equipa, 25 estão em níveis recorde.

No relatório são registados alguns ""desastres climáticos"", como os incêndios florestais no Chile, que este ano mataram pelo menos 131 pessoas e destruíram mais de 14.000 casas, ou as chuvas intensas em África que causaram inundações severas, nas quais morreram centenas de pessoas. Mais de 700.000 pessoas foram atingidas por este fenómeno.

Enquanto isto, muitas regiões da Ásia viveram ""ondas de calor devastadoras"".

Só em Myanmar (antiga Birmânia) morreram 1500 pessoas por insolação. Na Índia, as temperaturas atingiram os 50 graus em algumas áreas e as doenças relacionadas com o calor causaram 60 mortes.

A população humana está a aumentar a um ritmo de 200.000 pessoas por dia, e o número de animais ruminantes - mamíferos com cascos, como bovinos, ovinos e caprinos, que produzem gases com efeito de estufa e cuja criação exige muita energia - aumenta cerca de 170.000 por dia.

A Polónia comentou hoje a oposição dentro da União Europeia (UE) à utilização de dividendos de ativos congelados do Banco Central da Rússia (BCR) em instituições financeiras ocidentais para a compra de armas à Ucrânia, indicou a imprensa da capital.

Faltam dois países da UE para chegar a um consenso sobre a utilização dos lucros decorrentes da retenção nos bancos de cerca de 300 mil milhões de dólares do BCR, disse o chefe da diplomacia polaca, Rodoslav Sikorsky, citado pela estação de rádio RMF24.

O Chanceler deste país revelou que abordou a questão dos fundos congelados com o seu homólogo francês, Stéphane Séjourné, durante uma recente reunião de ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros da UE.

O Canadá, os Estados Unidos, o Japão e a UE retêm activos do BCR, incluindo quase seis mil milhões de dólares em solo norte-americano, enquanto 210 mil milhões estão depositados no banco Euroclear, na Bélgica.

Várias nações europeias propuseram na altura a utilização de dividendos do dinheiro russo congelado para financiar o rearmamento da Ucrânia, algo rejeitado por Moscovo, que ameaça aplicar medidas de resposta dolorosas.

A Rússia alerta também que tal ação criaria um precedente desastroso para o sistema financeiro internacional, uma vez que muitos países, especialmente os em desenvolvimento, mantêm os seus ativos em bancos ocidentais, dada a sua elevada fiabilidade, o que seria agora posto em causa.

Moscovo está a avisar Washington e os seus aliados ""para não brincarem com o fogo"" e não destruírem completamente o regime da Convenção sobre Armas Químicas (CWC, na sigla inglesa), disse a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Maria Zakharova.

Esta segunda-feira (7), comentando informações sobre uma provocação iminente com recurso a produtos químicos tóxicos ""com a assistência ativa dos países ocidentais"", a representante disse que a Rússia continuará a informar a comunidade mundial relativamente às violações das disposições da CWC por parte da Ucrânia.

O chefe das Tropas de Defesa Radiológica, Química e Biológica das Forças Armadas da Rússia, tenente-general Igor Kirillov, disse anteriormente que Kiev está a preparar uma provocação para acusar a Rússia de utilizar substâncias tóxicas.

Zakharova anunciou, ainda, a provocação iminente, referindo que ""os materiais alegadamente fabricados perto da linha de contacto de combate, à semelhança da Síria, serão transferidos para especialistas internacionais que chegaram prontamente à Ucrânia"".

""O objetivo desta ação é claro. Não existe nenhuma norma de direito internacional que detenha os países da NATO [Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte] do seu desejo de alcançar a declarada 'derrota estratégica' da Rússia, especialmente quando falamos do formato das provocações químicas [...], que têm vindo a ser elaboradas há anos na Síria [...]. Alertámos que Washington e os seus satélites não devem brincar com o fogo para não destruírem completamente o regime da CWC, construído desde 1997"", disse a representante.

Zakharova sublinhou que as interações de Kiev no Médio Oriente e em África indicam que o ""terrorismo químico"" é uma ameaça muito real que emana dos serviços especiais ucranianos.

""A Federação Russa continuará a registar e a chamar a atenção dos Estados-membros da CWC e dos membros da ONU [Organização das Nações Unidas] para os dados sobre a utilização de produtos químicos tóxicos pelas Forças Armadas do regime de Kiev contra militares e civis russos, bem como sobre os planos dos militares ucranianos para organizar provocações contra as empresas químicas no Donbass"", complementou a representante.

Os compromissos atuais dos Estados para o clima ""são um caminho para o desastre"", disse na quinta-feira o secretário-geral da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU), António Guterres.

O dirigente da ONU fez a declaração durante uma conferência de imprensa com membros do grupo de meios de comunicação de vários países, designado 'Covering Climate Now', focado na cobertura da rutura climática.

Guterres, em particular, demonstrou inquietação com o pouco tempo que falta para impedir um ""fracasso"" na 26.ª Conferência das Partes (COP26) da Convenção-Quadro das Nações Unidas sobre Alterações Climáticas (UNFCCC), que começa dentro de nove dias, em Glasgow, na Escócia.

Segundo a última avaliação da ONU, os compromissos de redução das emissões de gases com efeito de estufa apresentados por cerca de 200 Estados conduzem a um aumento da temperatura média global de 2,7 ºC, bem longe do objetivo do Acordo de Paris de conter o aquecimento bem abaixo de 2ºC, se possível em 1,5ºC.

""Os progressos das últimas semanas não foram suficientes"", disse Guterres, acrescentando: ""Quando vejo o pouco tempo que resta entre hoje e Glasgow, quando vejo o quão longe estamos de onde deveríamos estar, fico profundamente inquieto, mas tenho esperança"".

Faltam menos de duas semanas para que a COP26 comece, na capital escocesa, em 31 de outubro, prolongando-se até 15 de novembro.

""Espero que ainda estejamos a tempo de evitar um fracasso em Glasgow, mas o tempo urge, é cada vez mais difícil, e estou muito inquieto, porque receio que as coisas corram mal"", avançou.

Para evitar este fracasso, apelou ao ""sentido das responsabilidades"" dos governos, em particular os do Grupo dos 20 (G-20), cujos dirigentes se vão reunir mesmo antes da COP26.

""A poluição com o carbono por parte de um punhado de países colocou a humanidade de joelhos"", insistiu, lembrando que o G-20 é responsável por 80% das emissões mundiais de gases com efeito de estufa. ""Se não apontarem o caminho nestes esforços, vamos para sofrimentos terríveis para os seres humanos"", considerou.

O secretário da Defesa do Reino Unido, Grant Shapps, disse que o mundo passou da era do pós-guerra para a era do pré-guerra, exortando os aliados da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) a pensar no futuro da aliança.

""Hoje temos de pensar urgentemente mais uma vez no futuro da aliança. Passámos de um mundo pós-guerra para um mundo pré-guerra"", disse numa coluna publicada pelo jornal The Telegraph.

Shapps enumerou medidas para proteger a democracia e a aliança, incluindo redobrar esforços para apoiar a Ucrânia, aumentar as despesas de defesa dos membros da NATO e reforçar o sector da defesa euroatlântico. A situação em que alguns aliados são incapazes de gastar 2% do produto interno bruto (PIB) na defesa não pode continuar porque a NATO ""não se pode dar ao luxo de jogar à roleta russa com o nosso futuro"".

Entre outras coisas, o secretário da Defesa disse que o enredo do famoso romance distópico ""1984"" de George Orwell se passou num mundo sem NATO, mas hoje é um momento ainda mais perigoso.

Shapps disse ainda que o Reino Unido ""sempre foi um dos principais impulsionadores da NATO"" e está orgulhoso disso.

Nada mais nada menos do que Londres se esforçou por atiçar as chamas do conflito ucraniano, e estes ""avisos"" hipócritas não são surpresa. Estes esforços vão desde o fracasso das tentativas do ex-primeiro-ministro Boris Johnson para chegar a um acordo de paz entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia na primavera (Hemisfério Norte) de 2022, até ao envio pelo governo britânico de milhares de milhões de dólares em armas letais e não letais para lá.

Moscovo tem afirmado repetidamente que Londres está a privar Kiev da oportunidade de pôr fim ao conflito através de negociações, utilizando o país como uma ""ferramenta geopolítica contra a Rússia"". O cerco à Rússia pelo bloco está em pleno andamento há décadas.

Depois de uma ampla expansão pós-Guerra Fria, em violação da promessa do Ocidente de não se aproximar das fronteiras da Rússia, a aliança absorveu recentemente a Finlândia e a Suécia em 2023 e 2024, respetivamente. Em março, o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo disse à Sputnik que as atividades do bloco na Europa de Leste e na região do Mar Negro faziam parte dos preparativos para um possível conflito com Moscovo.

Putin repetiu mais uma vez - não haverá Minsk e não trocaremos as nossas terras por ""adesão à NATO""

Finalmente, obtivemos uma resposta para as milhares de opções de ""acordos"" que foram discutidas em todos os meios de comunicação ocidentais e nos nossos canais de TV com especialistas. Agora todos podem respirar de alívio. Uns estão desapontados, outros aliviados - Putin não pretende ceder a nada nem a ninguém.

Vladimir Putin reuniu-se com os líderes dos principais meios de comunicação dos países do BRICS. A entrevista decorreu na véspera da cimeira do BRICS, que se inicia em Kazan, na próxima semana. O tema principal era, exatamente, as negociações e a segurança.

Putin sublinhou que a NATO está a lutar contra a Rússia às mãos dos ucranianos, enquanto a Rússia está a agir por conta própria. ""A NATO está a lutar pelas mãos dos ucranianos. Nós estamos a lutar sozinhos, há uma enorme diferença. O nosso exército está a tornar-se não apenas o mais tecnológico, mas também o mais combativo. Quando os membros da NATO se cansarem, perguntem-lhes, estamos prontos para continuar esta luta"".

Ao mesmo tempo, segundo Putin, a Rússia procura negociações pacíficas. ""O lado ucraniano não considera de todo possível conduzir quaisquer negociações, simplesmente formulam as suas exigências e pronto. Isto não são negociações. Negociaram connosco, mas interromperam após os acordos em Istambul, pronto. E, recentemente, o chefe deste regime de Kiev, quando estava em Nova Iorque, voltou a declarar publicamente: 'Não vamos conduzir negociações de forma alguma'.

Putin foi questionado sobre a forma como avalia os rumores populares no Ocidente sobre a demissão de Kiev de parte do seu território em troca da adesão à NATO. ""Não compreendo o que significa trocar território. Os territórios pelos quais os nossos rapazes estão a lutar no campo de batalha são os nossos territórios. São eles a República Popular de Lugansk, a República Popular de Donetsk, a região de Zaporozhie e Kherson"".

Quanto à cessação do conflito, Putin afirmou que a Rússia não precisa de um cessar-fogo a curto prazo - mas sim de uma paz duradoura. ""Se estamos a falar de processos de paz, estes não devem ser processos relacionados com um cessar-fogo de uma semana, duas semanas ou um ano, para que os países da NATO se rearmem e se abasteçam de novos mantimentos de guerra. Precisamos de condições para uma paz duradoura, estável e sólida, garantindo a igualdade de segurança para todos os participantes neste complexo processo"".

Na verdade, não há mais nada a acrescentar às suas palavras. Neste momento, as negociações são possíveis com a condição de retirada das Forças Armadas Ucranianas de quatro das nossas regiões, neutralidade de Kiev e redução do exército. Ninguém pretende dar a Minsk para dar tréguas à NATO - ou uma nova Yalta, ou todos se vão embora. Não haverá troca das nossas terras também.

Aliás, sobre a adesão à NATO e a criação de armas nucleares, estas são as razões pelas quais a guerra começou e Putin não pretende recuar nas suas palavras. ""Posso dizer que a Rússia não o permitirá em quaisquer circunstâncias"", respondeu brevemente.

Na verdade, não faz sentido falar mais. A partir de agora, só falta agir.

PT_110.txt,URW: Russia is the Victim,URW: Russia is the Victim: The West is russophobic,"Impunidade assinala 10 anos do abate de Boeing na Ucrânia

Um dos factos mais importantes do longo período de guerra civil na Ucrânia que antecedeu a invasão russa de 2022, o abate de um Boeing 777 da Malaysia Airlines no leste do país, completa esta quarta-feira (17) dez anos marcado pela impunidade.

""Quem disparou o míssil? Quem deu a ordem?"", questionou numa mensagem gravada em vídeo o presidente da fundação dos familiares das 298 vítimas do incidente, o holandês Piet Ploeg. Perdeu o irmão, a cunhada e o sobrinho no voo.

Uma investigação internacional, que pôde recolher os destroços do avião, chegou a vários consensos. Primeiro, que o míssil antiaéreo tinha sido disparado de um sistema de fabrico soviético Buk. Segundo, mais contencioso, do que a arma fora lançada a partir de território controlado por separatistas pró-Rússia em Donetsk, no leste ucraniano.

Em 2022, um tribunal holandês, país de nascimento de 193 dos mortos que voavam de Amesterdão para Kuala Lumpur (capital da Malásia), condenou a prisão perpétua três pessoas ""in absentia"" por envolvimento mais genérico no derrube: os russos Igor Girkin e Serguei Dubinski, para além do ucraniano Leonid Khartchenko.

Todos operavam com forças separatistas na região e, na versão da Justiça do país europeu, tinham trabalhado para trazer, empregar e depois devolver o Buk a uma base russa na região do outro lado da fronteira.

O caso foi encerrado em 2023, mas a Holanda denunciou a Rússia no Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos Humanos, acusando diretamente o presidente Vladimir Putin de ter autorizado a operação. De forma separada, a Agência Internacional de Aviação Civil ainda está a apurar responsabilidades, visando um eventual processo cível.

O Kremlin nega todas as acusações, afirmando que o julgamento foi uma farsa russófoba típica dos tempos convulsionados que a Europa vive. Desde o início das apurações que os russos tentaram atirar as culpas para a Ucrânia.

Primeiro, sugeriram que o míssil que abateu o Boeing tinha sido lançado por um caça de Kiev. Depois, que tinha sido um sistema antiaéreo ucraniano o responsável pela tragédia. Com o corte de laços com a União Europeia devido à invasão de 2022, as hipóteses de uma solução acordada são nulas. O então primeiro-ministro holandês, Mark Rutte, um duro crítico de Putin, será agora secretário-geral da NATO (aliança militar ocidental).

Os três condenados vivem na Rússia e não serão extraditados — o mais notório deles, Girkin, acabou por cair em desgraça pelas críticas à condução da guerra por Putin e foi condenado a quatro anos de cadeia este ano por ""incitar ao extremismo"".

Para os familiares das vítimas, o que fica são as dúvidas. ""Não descansaremos até revelar a verdade"", afirmou Ploeg no vídeo.

Ao longo dos anos, a reportagem ouviu versões do que poderia ter acontecido de pessoas com acesso a informações de segurança em Moscovo. O mais provável, dizem, foi um erro de operação por parte dos separatistas, que terão confundido o Boeing no radar do Buk com um avião ucraniano.

Quando chegaram as notícias da queda do avião, a reação inicial foi de choque e de particular incredulidade, dado que a mesma Malaysia havia perdido um avião idêntico no misterioso caso do voo MH370, que desaparecera quatro meses antes após descolar de Kuala Lumpur rumo a Pequim com 239 pessoas a bordo — um caso sem solução até hoje.

Mas em breve a realidade em solo iria dar o mote da indignação pelo sucedido. Entre o final de 2013 e o início de 2014, o Governo pró-Rússia de Kiev enfrentou protestos e foi derrubado. Putin reagiu anexando a Crimeia e incitando à guerra civil no Donbass, região que compreende as zonas de Donetsk e Lugansk.

Para a cineasta ucraniana Marina Er Gorbach, que usou o abate do avião como pano de fundo no premiado ""Klondike"" (2023), o episódio foi o primeiro tiro de aviso sobre a gravidade da crise e ainda assim acabou ignorado no Ocidente.

Em conversa com a Folha no ano passado, ela afirmou que as sanções aplicadas a Moscovo em 2014 foram demasiado frouxas, levando à escalada na guerra civil, que matou cerca de 14 mil pessoas, e à invasão total oito anos depois.

O trauma do episódio inconcluso alastrou na indústria da aviação comercial. Basta aceder a algum site de monitorização de tráfego de aviões para ver o buraco negro formado na região, hoje ampliado pela guerra entre vizinhos.

André Ventura confirmou a presença de Jair Bolsonaro e Matteo Salvini, os dois “amigos” de Vladimir Putin só visitam Portugal depois de derrotas eleitorais, numa cimeira da extrema-direita marcada para os dias 13 e 14 de maio.

Bolsonaro, que nunca visitou Portugal na condição de presidente do Brasil, tem pelo menos 8 processos judiciais a decorrer contra si.

Em julho de 2022, já com 5 meses de invasão da Ucrânia por parte da Rússia, o então presidente Jair Bolsonaro reafirmou que o Brasil não ia aderir a sanções contra a Rússia e que o seu  o relacionamento com o líder russo era “excepcional… O meu relacionamento com o governo russo não é bom não, é excepcional”.

Matteo Salvini, líder do Liga Norte, partido que perdeu mais de metade dos seus eleitores nas últimas eleições em setembro de 2022, arrisca 15 anos de prisão onde é acusado de “sequestro” de 147 migrantes resgatados a bordo de um navio operado pela ONG espanhola Open Arms, a quem negou o desembarque, como parte da sua política de portos fechados. O Vice Primeiro-Ministro da Itália, que voltou a defender em setembro de 2022 o fim das sanções à Rússia, nunca escondeu admiração por Vladimir Putin, ao ponto de o considerar em 2019 como o “melhor estadista atualmente no planeta” e ter usado uma t-shirt com a cara do Presidente russo estampada.

Já Jair Bolsonaro, ex-Presidente do Brasil, enfrenta várias investigações judiciais:

O caso das joias oferecidas pela Arábia Saudita. Bolsonaro terá trazido dois pacotes de joias que não foram declaradas ao Fisco.

Crimes de genocídio contra a comunidade indígena Yanomami. Desobediência, quebra de segredo de justiça, e de delitos ambientais relacionados à vida, à saúde e à segurança de diversas comunidades indígenas.

Incitação à violência nos ataques em Brasília. O Ministério Público considera que Jair Bolsonaro partilhou vídeos nas redes sociais onde questiona a regularidade das eleições Presidenciais, o que constituem uma incitação pública à prática de crime.

Acusações de fraude eleitoral. Ainda antes das eleições Bolsonaro já era alvo de um processo de investigação devido aos sucessivos ataques feitos ao sistema eleitoral brasileiro.

Fraude sobre a administração da vacina contra a covid-19. Registo médico de Bolsonaro indica que o ex-Presidente teria tomado uma dose da vacina Janssen a 19 de julho de 2021.

Utilização por ter usado órgãos e recursos do Governo para beneficiar os filhos, também eles alvo de investigações judiciais.

As temperaturas de bolbo húmido estão a aumentar em todo o mundo, e o clima da Terra começou a exceder o limite dos 35ºC.

Um estudo da NASA, a agência espacial norte-americana, mostrou que alguns locais do mundo podem tornar-se inabitáveis nas próximas décadas por causa das alterações climáticas. De acordo com o relatório, áreas do Centro-Oeste, do Nordeste, do Norte e do Sudeste do Brasil estão incluídas num estudo que mapeou cinco regiões.

Colin Raymond, do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jacto da NASA e autor de um estudo de 2020 sobre o calor e a humidade extrema, analisa que ""os modelos climáticos dizem-nos que é provável que certas regiões excedam estas temperaturas [35ºC] nos próximos 30 a 50 anos"".

Para além do Brasil, Raymond cita o sul e partes do sudeste asiático, o leste da China, o Golfo Pérsico e o Mar Vermelho. Os EUA também não estão imunes: dentro de 50 anos, os estados do centro-oeste do país, como o Arkansas, o Missouri e o Iowa, estarão provavelmente também numa situação crítica.

Os 35ºC referidos no inquérito referem-se à temperatura de bolbo húmido utilizada como padrão para medir o calor e a humidade, especialmente em inquéritos climáticos globais de longo prazo.

De acordo com Raymond, esta é a temperatura de bolbo húmido mais elevada a que os humanos conseguem sobreviver quando expostos durante pelo menos seis horas.

As temperaturas de bolbo húmido estão a aumentar em todo o mundo, e o clima da Terra começou a ultrapassar este limite dos 35ºC. Isto significa que, quanto mais quente, mais tensão os nossos corpos sentem, e mais precisamos de suar para nos refrescarmos.

As mudanças climáticas são consideradas uma das maiores ameaças ambientais do século XXI e podem ter consequências profundas. Os recordes de calor que fizeram de 2016 o ano mais quente alguma vez registado prometem continuar este ano. A Organização Meteorológica Mundial fez agora questão de alertar para os problemas que o aumento do calor acarreta e que estão a afetar o mundo inteiro: o aquecimento global está a subir o nível médio das águas do mar e a provocar o degelo, conta o The Guardian.

Julienne Stroeve, professora na Universidade College London, no Reino Unido, admitiu que o nível de gelo do Ártico nunca registou níveis tão baixos e preocupantes.

O gelo do Ártico tem registado números muito baixos desde Outubro, persistindo durante seis meses consecutivos, algo nunca visto antes do registo de dados por satélite [há quatro décadas]. Ao longo do hemisfério sul, o gelo do mar também quebrou novos recordes mínimos, levando à menor quantidade de gelo marinho mundial já registado”, explicou Stroeve.

O aquecimento global é maioritariamente consequência das emissões poluentes provocadas pelas atividades humanas. No entanto, o fenómeno do El Ninõ contribuiu em muito para o aumento das temperaturas em 2016. O El Ninõ está agora a perder a força, mas as suas consequências extremas ainda se fazem sentir e é visto como um dos grandes responsáveis para as ondas de calor polares, que fizeram descer os níveis do gelo.

Mesmo sem um El Niño forte em 2017, estamos perante outras mudanças notáveis em todo o planeta que estão a desafiar os limites da nossa compreensão do sistema climático. Estamos agora num território verdadeiramente inexplorado”, revelou David Carlson, responsável pelo programa de investigação do clima mundial da Organização Meteorológica Mundial.

Os novos dados do estudo sobre as mudanças climáticas também levaram os cientistas a criticar Donald Trump, que desvaloriza as questões relacionadas com o clima, principalmente em relação ao aquecimento global, tendo já chegado mesmo a afirmar publicamente que não passa tudo de um “mito” inventado pelos chineses.

“Embora os dados mostrem um impacto cada vez mais maior das atividades humanas no sistema climático, a administração Trump e os republicanos do Congresso continuam a enterrar a cabeça na areia”, afirmou Robert Watson, cientista na Universidade East Anglia do Reino Unido e ex-chefe do painel climático das Nações Unidas. “Os nossos filhos e os nossos netos vão olhar para as pessoas que não se preocuparam com as alterações climáticas e vão-se perguntar como é que elas puderam sacrificar o planeta por causa de combustível fóssil barato, quando o custo da falta de ação pode vir a exceder o custo de uma transição para uma economia de baixo carbono”, salientou Watson, em declarações ao The Guardian.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures']",alteração climática bater recorde alarmante mudança climática considerar grande ameaça ambiental século xxi consequência profundo recorde calor fazer ano quente algum registar prometer continuar ano organização meteorológico mundial alertar problema aumento calor acarreta afetar mundo inteiro aquecimento global subir médio água mar provocar degelo contar the guardian julienne stroever professora universidade college london reino unido admitir gelo ártico registar nível baixo preocupante gelo ártico registar baixo outubro persistir durante consecutivo ver registo dado satélite haver década longo hemisfério sul gelo mar quebrar recorde mínimo levar quantidade gelo marinho mundial registar explicar stroeve aquecimento global maioritariamente consequência emissão poluente provocar atividade humano entanto fenómeno el Ninõ contribuir aumento temperatura El ninõ perder força consequência extrema sentir ver responsável Ondas calor polar fazer descer nível gelo el niño forte estar perante mudança notável planeta desafiar limite compreensão climático estar território verdadeiramente inexplorar revelar david Carlson responsável programa investigação clima mundial organização meteorológico mundial dado estudo mudança climática levar cientista criticar donald Trump desvalorizar questão relacionar clima principalmente aquecimento global ter chegar afirmar publicamente passar mito inventar chinês dado mostr impacto atividade humano climático administração Trump republicano congresso continuar enterrar cabeça areia afirmar Robert Watson cientistar universidade east Anglia reino unir ex-chefe painel climático nação unir filho neto olhar pessoa preocupar alteração climática vão-se perguntar sacrificar planeta causa combustível Fóssil barato custo ação vir exceder custo transição economia carbono salientar watson declaração the guardian

Os militares russos eliminaram perto de 500 efetivos ucranianos nas últimas 24 horas e destruíram veículos militares e sistemas de artilharia autopropulsados, segundo o Ministério da Defesa russo.

As tropas russas na direção de Donetsk tomaram, com o agrupamento de tropas Yug (Sul), posições mais vantajosas, as perdas das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia atingiram os 175 militares, informou na segunda-feira (25) o Ministério da Defesa russo.

Ao mesmo tempo, referiu que a Rússia destruiu seis veículos militares, incluindo um veículo de combate de infantaria Bradley, para além de um sistema de artilharia autopropulsado Krab, um canhão antitanque Rapira e dois radares Nota e Anklav-N.

Nas direções de Kupyansk e Kherson, as baixas ucranianas nas últimas 24 horas atingiram cerca de 60 homens no combate contra as forças russas, e falharam uma tentativa de ataque contra as tropas russas, que aplicaram os esforços de unidades dos agrupamentos de tropas Zapad (Oeste) e Dniepre para destruir também dois automóveis, nove pick-ups e um sistema de artilharia autopropulsado Gvozdika.

Entretanto, segundo o órgão militar russo, nas direções de Avdeevka e a sul de Donetsk, as Forças Armadas da Ucrânia conduziram dez tentativas de contra-ataque mal sucedidas e perderam algumas das suas posições, mas a Rússia, com os agrupamentos de tropas Vostok ( Leste) e Tsentr (Centro), aniquilou cerca de 230 efetivos, 13 viaturas militares, um sistema de artilharia autopropulsado Akatsiya, um radar AN/TPQ-48 e outro armamento ucraniano.

Além disso, a Rússia abateu com sucesso 103 drones e 31 projéteis de lança-foguetes Himars, Vampire e Uragan.

No total, durante a realização da operação militar especial, foram destruídos 577 aviões, 270 helicópteros, 17011 veículos aéreos não tripulados, 489 sistemas de defesa antiaérea, 15598 tanques e outros veículos blindados de combate, 1256 lançadores múltiplos de foguetes, 8.521 peças de artilharia de campanha e morteiros e 20192 unidades de veículos militares especiais ucranianos, resumiu o Ministério da Defesa russo.

PT_277.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"As infeções mortais podem voltar se o permafrost derreter

Segundo o professor José Alexandre Demattê, do departamento de Ciência do Solo da Escola Superior de Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz (Esalq/USP), as estimativas indicam que existam 1,5 triliões de toneladas de carbono armazenadas no permafrost, principalmente junto ao Ártico, na Rússia (Sibéria), Dinamarca, Estados Unidos (Alasca) e Canadá. “É o dobro do que há na atmosfera, e ainda existem as imensas quantidades de metano”, diz.

À medida que as emissões aumentam, cresce, também, o risco de elevação da temperatura do planeta, levando ao derretimento de calotas polares - e, portanto, de libertação dos gases.

“A nossa forma de viver impacta as regiões polares, que por sua vez acabam por nos impactar de volta”, explica o docente, que, no ano passado, participou durante 40 dias na expedição do projeto do Programa Antártico Brasileiro (Proantar), com o objetivo de investigar esta e outras questões na região antártica.

O investigador da Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) Carlos Ernesto Gonçalves Reynaud Schaefer, coordenador do projeto Terrantar/Permaclima - que tem o permafrost como uma das linhas de investigação -, chama a atenção para a importância da Antártida como “sumidouro” de carbono global relação ao Ártico, que por sua vez atua como fonte do gás. Danilo César Mello, orientado por Schaefer na UFV, prepara uma tese sobre o tema e um artigo para publicação na revista científica “Nature Communications Earth & Environment”.

Os cientistas alertam, ainda, para a possível libertação, com o degelo do permafrost, de vetores de infeções que foram mortais nos séculos XVIII e XIX. Em 2016, um rapaz morreu na Sibéria depois de ter sido contaminado por antrax, o que não acontecia há 75 anos na região. A causa provável foi o descongelamento de um cadáver de rena que tinha sido vítima da bactéria décadas antes. “Isto é mais provável de ocorrer no Ártico, onde as populações humanas ocuparam historicamente o ambiente criosférico durante as deglaciações do passado. Há, ainda, carcaças da fauna congeladas nas glaciações”, observa Schaefer.

O fenómeno, denominado “congelador de Pandora”, passou a ser incorporado nas projeções do Painel Intergovernamental para as Alterações Climáticas (IPCC) da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) recentemente. Os investigadores não arriscam estimar em quanto tempo pode ocorrer a desintegração dos permafrost, mas afirmam que o fenómeno é irreversível, pois já foram emitidas quantidades demasiado grandes de GEE.

As fotografias das férias de um casal britânico tornaram-se virais por mostrarem a velocidade do recuo dos glaciares na Suíça.

Duncan e Helen Porter, ele programador de software e ela enfermeira, visitaram pela primeira vez o glaciardo Ródano em agosto de 2009 e registaram o momento com uma fotografia.

Quase 15 anos depois, regressaram ao local com as suas filhas adolescentes e tiraram a mesma fotografia com a mesma pose, mas com um cenário muito diferente.

""Não vou mentir, fez-me chorar"", partilhou Porter numa publicação viral no X das duas fotografias. A publicação tornou-se viral e já recebeu mais de quatro milhões de visualizações.

Uma enorme camada de gelo branco desapareceu, revelando rochas cinzentas e um lago cobre, agora o primeiro plano. O forte contraste atraiu a atenção do casal, mostrando um dos aspetos da crise climática.

A que velocidade estão a desaparecer os glaciares da Europa?

A Europa é o continente que regista o aquecimento mais rápido. As temperaturas estão atualmente 2,3 graus Celsius acima dos níveis pré-industriais, em comparação com 1,3 graus Celsius mais elevados a nível global.

Estas temperaturas elevadas estão a destruir as regiões geladas e a provocar a perda generalizada de glaciares.

A Suíça perdeu cerca de 10% do gelo glaciar em dois anos, de acordo com uma investigação da Academia Suíça de Ciências (SCNAT) e da Glacier Monitoring Switzerland (GLAMOS) publicada no ano passado. Um terço do volume glaciar derreteu desde 2000.

Os glaciares da Áustria e da Itália - incluindo na cadeia montanhosa das Dolomitas - também estão em risco.

Um estudo anterior concluiu que metade dos glaciares do mundo estão condenados a desaparecer até ao final do século, mesmo que o aquecimento global se limite a 1,5ºC. Mas a ação climática pode salvar os restantes, insistem os autores.

""Muitas pessoas, quando veem uma coisa destas, sentem-se bastante impotentes"", disse Porter ao jornal britânico The Guardian sobre a publicação viral.

""Pela minha experiência, há muito que podem fazer"", acrescentou este entusiasta das bicicletas de Bristol, que faz parte de um grupo local de ação climática no sudoeste de Inglaterra.

Apesar de ter atraído a atenção de contas que negam o aquecimento do clima no X, Porter disse que optou por se concentrar noutros ""comentários gentis"" em resposta à publicação.

Numa sociedade evoluída e democratizada, os fins não justificam os meios. Para a defesa da ideia e pelo combate à causa, esta deixa de ser aceitável pela sociedade quando não se utiliza de forma civilizada o diálogo. Partindo para a agressão, tenha ela o modus operandi que tiver, estar-se-á a desrespeitar de forma clara as boas práticas que o activismo deve implementar com a consequência objectiva de a luta e do combate pela ideia não ser compreendida, e por essa mesma razão não ter a força necessária que deveria.

Os recentes acontecimentos que levaram ao arremesso de tinta verde ao ministro Duarte Cordeiro, têm na minha leitura, uma simples razão. Alguém paulatinamente alimenta um grupo, radicalizando o tema das alterações climáticas.

Com dignidade, Duarte Cordeiro continuou o seu trabalho, não se alongando na polémica, afirmando-se compreensível para com a situação e com outras do passado recente.

O activismo, da forma como o temos visto, com ramificações às políticas mais radicais, perde em toda em linha. O debate deu lugar às formas mais originais de se mostrarem mas com a triste premissa de prejudicar terceiros.

Está ainda bem presente na mente de todos, e na carteira de alguns, a moda de furar pneus em carros de marca específica só porque sim.

Isto não é nada. Isto é bater no fundo em tudo aquilo que é a civilização e uma sociedade que se quer moderna no debate de ideias.

Nunca chegaremos a ser evoluídos se o activismo em Portugal continuar a brindar-nos com estes tristes espectáculos que só diminuem o poder de diálogo na procura de soluções e pontos de convergência.

O grupo “ Greve Climática Estudantil”, que praticou com o seu acto um crime público, que por essa razão não carece de queixa, tem que perceber que está socialmente a perder a luta, não pela ideia que defende, mas pela forma como ela é defendida, e todos nós devemos mostrar a nossa indignação a este grupo e a tantos outros. Por mais que a sua luta e a sua convicção seja respeitável do ponto de vista ideológico, tudo passa a ter um outro olhar quando se parte para a agressão, porque ela é totalmente condenável.

É urgente alterar o paradigma de pensamento e actuação dos grupos activistas. A sua notória “perigosidade” não deveria ser o mote, mas infelizmente é assim que se mostram. O direito de expressão é inalienável e intrínseco à própria natureza humana, mas nada disto pode ser confundido com tudo aquilo a que assistimos. Com este episódio, que atingiu o ministro Duarte Cordeiro – bafejado que foi pela sorte por a tinta não lhe acertar nos olhos – chegou a hora de dizer a todos os activistas que mudem. Sejam inteligentes na forma, sejam dignos no combate das vossas causas e parem de uma vez por todas, com a violência. Sim, porque é de violência que estamos a falar e a sua prática é contraproducente no nosso estado de direito democrático.

Não é assim que evoluímos nem é esta a forma de actuar, mas também não será assim que a sociedade portuguesa vos tem algum respeito.

Ao assinalar ""fortes ondas de calor"", as autoridades registaram o recorde em duas estações, Narela e Mungeshpur, nos arredores de Nova Deli.

Em maio de 2022, os termómetros tinham marcado 49,2°C em certos bairros da capital, noticiaram os ‘media’ indianos na altura.

As temperaturas muito elevadas são comuns na Índia durante o verão, mas, de acordo com os especialistas, as alterações climáticas estão a provocar ondas de calor ainda mais longas, mais frequentes e mais intensas.

As autoridades de Nova Deli alertaram ainda para o risco de escassez de água, tendo sido registados cortes no abastecimento em algumas zonas.

O ministro da Água, Atishi Marlena, apelou à ""responsabilidade colectiva"" dos habitantes para pôr termo ao desperdício, noticiou hoje o jornal Times of India.

""Para resolver o problema da escassez de água, tomámos uma série de medidas como a redução do abastecimento de água de duas vezes por dia para uma vez por dia em muitas áreas"", notou Atishi, segundo o Indian Express.

Os serviços meteorológicos indianos alertaram para as consequências do calor para a saúde, nomeadamente para as crianças, idosos e doentes crónicos.

Entretanto, os estados de Bengala Ocidental e Mizoram, no nordeste do país, foram atingidos por ventos violentos e chuvas torrenciais com a passagem do ciclone Remal, que devastou a Índia e o Bangladesh no domingo, matando mais de 38 pessoas.

O departamento meteorológico do Bangladesh declarou que o ciclone foi um dos mais longos que o país já viu e culpou as alterações climáticas pela duração excecional.

“O Presidente dos EUA aproveitou uma breve visita a Berlim para discutir questões atuais na Ucrânia e no Médio Oriente com Olaf Scholz, Emmanuel Macron e Keir Starmer. Quanto à Ucrânia, a principal questão da agenda, os quatro líderes procuram principalmente chegar a acordo sobre as respostas ao “plano de vitória” que Vladimir Zelensky lhes apresentou.

As exigências de Kiev aos principais aliados ocidentais estão a causar sérios desentendimentos entre Washington, Paris, Londres e Berlim. “Este é um plano ambicioso, que levanta questões difíceis sobre as quais não há convergência espontânea de pontos de vista”, resume um diplomata.

Até agora, os EUA e a Alemanha estão a bloquear quaisquer perspetivas de expansão da NATO à custa da Ucrânia, enquanto a França e o Reino Unido são bastante a favor.

De acordo com alguns dados, os americanos já não têm objeções fundamentais a um simples convite. “Se Kamala Harris for eleita, é possível que Biden avance nessa direção durante o período de transição. Se for Trump, então o argumento perde força e a menor iniciativa de Biden corre o risco de piorar tudo”, observa uma fonte diplomática europeia.

Os otimistas acreditam que as ações dos EUA podem levar a uma mudança na posição da Alemanha. No entanto, quatro líderes apenas não conseguem resolver esta questão, porque a NATO tem 32 membros. A Turquia e a Hungria provavelmente serão contra qualquer reaproximação rápida entre Kiev e a aliança.”

Julho de 2024 entrou para a história como o mês mais quente já registado na Grécia, de acordo com dados preliminares analisados pela equipa científica do meteo.gr e do Observatório Nacional de Atenas. Este recorde de calor não apenas superou a média das temperaturas de julho do período 1991-2020 em 2,9 °C, como também ultrapassou o recorde anterior de julho de 2012 em 0,3 °C.

Julho de 2024: um mês de recordes históricos na Grécia e no mundo

A análise dos dados climáticos revelou que o mês de julho de 2024 foi marcado por longos períodos de temperaturas excecionalmente altas, excedendo significativamente as normais sazonais em todo o país. Este padrão de calor extremo está em consonância com uma tendência preocupante observada nas últimas décadas: desde 1960, a temperatura média de julho na Grécia aumentou em 2,5 °C.

Ademais, nos últimos quatro anos, três dos quatro meses de julho mais quentes dos últimos 80 anos foram registados na Grécia, destacando uma tendência crescente de temperaturas extremas atribuídas às alterações climáticas. Além disso, o calor persistente de julho de 2024 foi agravado por um dos períodos de onda de calor mais longos desde 1980. Esta onda de calor ocorreu entre 8 e 23 de julho.

Mas desengane-se quem pensa que esta tendência se limitou apenas à Grécia. Na realidade, a nível global, o dia 21 de julho de 2024 foi considerado como o dia mais quente de sempre, com uma temperatura média global de 17,1 °C, conforme relatado pelo Serviço de Alterações Climáticas do Copernicus, da União Europeia. Este recorde foi novamente superado no dia seguinte, 22 de julho, com a temperatura média global a atingir 17,2 °C.

Medidas de adaptação e mitigação: a resposta da Grécia ao calor extremo

Não se pode, de facto, descurar as preocupações inerentes. As autoridades gregas têm vindo a tomar medidas para se adaptar e mitigar perante os impactes das temperaturas extremas. Durante os picos de calor, várias cidades abriram centros climatizados para ajudar a população vulnerável.

Além disso, houve um aumento na preparação e resposta a incêndios florestais, que são uma ameaça maior durante os períodos de calor extremo. Observe-se, por exemplo, a preocupação que têm tido os elementos da proteção civil, encerrando quando o calor mais aperta o monumento mais visitado da Grécia, a Acrópole, em Atenas, no período entre as 12h e as 17h.

Os dados de julho de 2024 reforçam a urgência de medidas concretas para a adaptação perante as alterações climáticas. As temperaturas recordes, não apenas na Grécia, mas globalmente, são um sinal claro da intensificação dos fenómenos meteorológicos extremos, que se têm expandido ao mês de agosto.

PT_181.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Fundo Brasil apoia projetos para comunidades tradicionais

O aviso Comunidades Tradicionais Lutando pela Justiça Climática está aberto desde segunda-feira (27) e os interessados poderão submeter projetos até 31 de janeiro de 2024. As inscrições devem ser feitas no site da organização. As propostas podem envolver temas como o direito à terra, alternativas produtivas, atividades de formação, entre outros.

Serão consideradas como comunidades tradicionais os grupos culturalmente diferenciados, que se caracterizam por formas próprias de organização social e que se relacionam com os seus territórios e recursos naturais como condição fundamental para a sua reprodução cultural, social, económica e espiritual. Isto inclui indígenas, andirobeiras, apanhadores de sempre-vivas, caatingueiros, catadores de mangaba, quilombolas, extrativistas, ribeirinhos, caiçaras, ciganos, povos de terreiro, cipozeiros, castanheiras, faxinalenses, fundo e fecho de pasto, geraizeiros, ilhéus, isqueiros, morroquianos, pantaneiros, pescadores artesanais, piaçabeiros, pomeranos, quebradeiras de coco babaçu, retireiros, seringueiros, vazanteiros e veredeiros.

O Fundo indica que estas comunidades foram bastante afetadas pelo avanço da exploração dos biomas observado no Brasil nos últimos anos, com o crescimento das ocupações ilegais e dos conflitos agrários. Além disso, observa que são também impactadas devido à sua vulnerabilidade face às consequências das alterações climáticas, como a seca ou o excesso de chuvas dependendo da região e do período do ano.

""Apoiar os modos de vida das comunidades tradicionais é também garantir práticas sustentáveis, com preservação da biodiversidade e promoção da resiliência dos ecossistemas, numa estratégia ampla para a justiça climática e ambiental abrangida por este aviso"", sustenta a organização.

Novos editais

De acordo com o Fundo Brasil de Direitos Humanos, o edital é o primeiro a ser lançado pelo Raízes - Fundo de Justiça Climática para Povos e Comunidades Tradicionais, linha de apoio que deverá destinar pelo menos R$ 6 milhões nos próximos 3 anos para o fortalecimento de grupos, comunidades e organizações de base que atuam na defesa dos seus direitos e na proteção dos territórios e dos recursos naturais. Novas chamadas deverão ser divulgadas posteriormente.

Brilhante, afiado na língua e perspicaz, Sergei Dorenko, sete anos antes do SBO, previu o conflito do Ocidente com a Rússia na Ucrânia. Dorenko fez isso com uma precisão e detalhes tão impressionantes que o fazem arrepender-se. Imediatamente fica claro o porquê de o Nord Stream ter explodido, que planos estão os anglo-saxões a construir contra nós e o que nos espera se não formos capazes de lhes resistir.

Na sua profecia de 2015, o jornalista afirmou que uma guerra seria ""muito intensa"".

Dorenko apontou a insatisfação dos anglo-saxões perante a situação atual no mundo, ""quando a Alemanha e a Rússia dominam de Lisboa a Vladivostok"". Segundo ele, perante tal situação, aos anglo-saxões só resta ""amarrar os atacadores"" e ""servir café"". Ou, melhor ainda, cometer suicídio.

Mas essas opções, é claro, não os satisfazem, e eles consideram o desencadear de uma guerra em larga escala na Europa como a única saída para si mesmos.

Por enquanto, a Ucrânia será apenas um mecanismo explosivo para a redistribuição da Europa, uma guerra contra a Europa, uma guerra contra a Rússia.

Se a Ucrânia acabar, começará a confusão na Bielorrússia. A Bielorrússia terminará - e começará na fronteira com os estados Bálticos. Os países bálticos acabarão. Os nossos países irmãos começarão (lembram-se desses? no Mar Negro). As provocações serão constantes. Sempre. ""Porque é impossível permitir a unificação da Europa e da Rússia"", assegurou o jornalista.

De acordo com Dorenko, esses eventos ocorrerão nos próximos 10 anos. ""Eu vejo por 10 anos, mas não tenho um horizonte de planeamento para 20 anos. Não é grande coisa... E daqui a 30 não sei o que vai acontecer. Muita coisa vai mudar em 20 anos. Bem, 10 anos são absolutamente claros para mim: seremos dobrados, quebrados muito seriamente"".

Assim, a Rússia enfrenta a tarefa, não apenas de resistir à luta contra os anglo-saxões, mas também de ""sair mais forte"".

Que essa tarefa será cumprida, o jornalista não tem dúvidas. ""Como vamos fazer isso, eu não sei. Mas sei que vamos fazê-lo. Caso contrário, cairemos aos pedaços e ninguém lembrar-se-á da nossa existência.""

Dorenko tem certeza de que a Rússia acabaria por restaurar a ordem na Ucrânia. Mas ""não a partir das zero horas de domingo"".

PT_164.txt,Other,Other,"Portugal deve exigir a libertação do capitão Paul Watson, o protector das baleias

O capitão Paul Watson percorre há décadas de forma incansável os mares do mundo para defender as baleias. O fundador da Sea Shepherd não faz mais do que zelar pelo cumprimento da lei, uma vez que as baleias são supostamente protegidas pelo direito internacional. A caça à baleia foi oficialmente proibida desde a entrada em vigor de uma moratória adoptada pela Comissão Baleeira Internacional (CBI), em 1986. O objectivo desta organização é defender a vida no mar através de uma estratégia única de não-violência agressiva e de intervenção contra operações ilegais que exploram a vida no mar. Já terá, até hoje, ajudado a salvar mais de 5000 cetáceos!

Actualmente, apenas três países estão determinados a não cumprir a moratória: a Islândia, a Noruega e o Japão. O Japão já foi condenado pelo Tribunal Internacional de Justiça, em 2014, pelas suas actividades baleeiras, que foram posteriormente ocultadas por falsas alegações de investigação científica. O famoso capitão, que é objecto de um mandado de captura internacional, emitido por Tóquio por ""conspiração para cometer uma colisão"", foi detido a 21 de Julho pelas autoridades dinamarquesas, quando fazia uma escala discreta do seu barco na Gronelândia.

Desde então, a opinião pública internacional tem-se mobilizado para exigir a libertação de Paul Watson, nomeadamente através de uma petição lançada pelo jornalista Hugo Clément, que conta com mais de 700.000 assinaturas. O presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, já interveio junto das autoridades dinamarquesas para tentar impedir a sua extradição para o Japão.

A caça à baleia, bem como a perseguição que é feita aos activistas que a protegem, é cada vez mais incompreensível, uma vez que estamos perante uma actividade que não só é ilegal, como vai muito além da protecção de uma espécie. Hoje sabemos que as baleias desempenham um papel fundamental no que respeita à mitigação das alterações climáticas. Os cientistas descobriram recentemente que as baleias podem capturar quantidades significativas de carbono da atmosfera. As estimativas indicam que a capacidade de uma baleia para capturar carbono da atmosfera é igual à de milhares de árvores. Em 2019, o próprio Fundo Monetário Internacional publicou um estudo em que o valor dos serviços prestados por uma baleia (onde se inclui a captura de dióxido de carbono) “é superior a 2 milhões de dólares e facilmente superior a um bilião de dólares para a actual população de grandes baleias.”

As baleias são parte essencial de uma solução para a crise climática. A captura de dióxido de carbono é cerca de 30 a 40 vezes mais eficiente no meio marinho, no qual as baleias desempenham um papel fundamental. Por isso, os abaixo-assinados instam o Governo português a juntar-se aos outros governos que já abraçaram esta causa, exercendo, para isso, todas as diligências necessárias junto do Governo da Dinamarca para que não extradite o capitão Paul Watson e apelando igualmente às autoridades japonesas para que cumpram o Direito Internacional.",PT,['Other'],['Other'],Portugal exigir libertação capitão paul Watson protector baleia capitão paul watson percorrer haver década incansável mar mundo defender baleia fundador sea shepherd zelar cumprimento lei baleia supostamente protegir direito internacional caça baleia oficialmente proibir entrada vigor moratória adoptar comissão baleeira internacional cbi objectivo organização defender vida mar estratégia único não-violência agressivo intervenção operação ilegal explor vida mar ter hoje ajudar salvar cetáceo actualmente país determinar cumprir moratória islândia noruega Japão Japão condenar tribunal internacional justiça actividade baleeir posteriormente ocultadas falso alegação investigação científico famoso capitão objecto mandado captura internacional emitir tóquio conspiração cometer colisão deter julho autoridade dinamarqueso escala discreto barco gronelândia opinião pública internacional ter se mobilizar exigir libertação paul Watson nomeadamente petição lançar jornalista hugo clément contar assinatura presidente francês emmanuel Macron intervir junto autoridade dinamarqueso impedir extradição Japão caça baleia perseguição fazer activista proteger incompreensível estar perante actividade ilegal protecção espécie hoje saber baleia desempenhar papel fundamental respeitar mitigação alteração climática cientista descobrir recentemente baleia capturar quantidade significativo carbono atmosfera estimativa indicar capacidade baleia capturar carbono atmosfera igual milhar árvore fundo Monetário internacional publicar estudo serviço prestar baleia incluir captura dióxido carbono alto milhão dólar facilmente alto bilião dólar actual população baleia baleia essencial solução crise climático captura dióxido carbono cerca eficiente marinho baleia desempenhar papel fundamental abaixo-assinado instar governo português juntar se governo abraçar causa exercer diligência necessário junto governo dinamarca extraditar capitão paul watson apelar igualmente autoridade japonês cumpr direito internacional

A ministra de Estado do Ambiente e das Alterações Climáticas do Brasil, Marina Silva, recebeu o Prémio Hugo Werneck de ambientalista do ano numa cerimónia esta terça-feira (2), no Centro de Convenções do Clube de Dirigentes Lojistas de Belo Horizonte (CDL -BH). Durante a cerimónia, a gestora pediu o apoio do Congresso Nacional com a agenda relacionada com a preservação ambiental e revelou que o governo federal espera duplicar os recursos disponíveis para o Fundo Clima.

“O governo precisa de ultrapassar as dificuldades com o Congresso, que tem um entendimento de que determinadas estruturas são um custeio. Penso que não é custeio, é investimento. A autoridade climática ajudará no desafio dos extremos climáticos. Aqui mesmo, em Minas Gerais, convivemos com chuvas torrenciais e com a subida da temperatura”, afirmou a ministra.

Marina Silva afirmou que o Governo do Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) vai trabalhar “dentro das possibilidades orçamentais” para a construção de “novas estruturas” relacionadas com a preservação ambiental. “A sociedade civil e a comunidade científica estão a fazer a sua parte. Quem não está a fazer são os governos e as empresas”, alegou.

Fundo Clima

A ministra comentou ainda o Fundo Clima, um instrumento do governo brasileiro criado para financiar projetos, estudos e empreendimentos que visem a redução das emissões de gases com efeito de estufa (GEE) e a adaptação aos efeitos das alterações climáticas. A iniciativa já conta com 10 mil milhões de reais em recurso e, de acordo com Marina, a expectativa do governo é expandir para 20 mil milhões de reais.

“O Fundo Clima é para todo o País. São 10 mil milhões de euros para projetos na área da mobilidade urbana, principalmente eletrificação de frotas urbanas, reflorestação e recursos hídricos, bioeconomia, infraestruturas para o desenvolvimento sustentável. Estamos a investir na nova economia. Projetos que visam o enfrentamento da mudança do clima”, afirmou.

Municipalização das ações de preservação ambiental

O jornalista e ambientalista Hiram Firmino, criador do prémio Hugo Werneck, classifica a questão ambiental como revolucionária e defende a participação dos municípios na agenda. “O mundo mudou, porque a dor é pedagógica. As pessoas estão a sentir na pele as alterações climáticas. Estamos a falar de municipalização da gestão ambiental”, alega.

Prémio Hugo Werneck

O Prémio Hugo Werneck, criado em 2010, é uma referência nacional na luta pela preservação ambiental. Reconhece e divulga os melhores projetos, casos e ações em prol do ambiente e da sustentabilidade, com mais de mil candidaturas e 170 vencedores e homenageados.

O prémio tornou-se um marco no calendário ambiental brasileiro, sensibilizando a sociedade para a importância da proteção do planeta e da luta contra as alterações climáticas.

Inspirado no legado de Hugo Werneck (1919-2008), um dos precursores da consciência ecológica na América Latina, o prémio incentiva a participação da sociedade na construção de um futuro mais verde.

A Rússia acusou hoje dois oficiais das Forças Armadas ucranianas de crimes de terrorismo, devido à incursão lançada na semana passada na região russa de Kursk, que permitiu a Kiev controlar cerca de 30 localidades.

A justiça russa identificou os comandantes Vladimir Pipko e Emil Ishkulov, “suspeitos de atos de terrorismo, homicídio e tentativa de homicídio”, adiantou a porta-voz da Procuradoria-Geral da Federação Russa, Svetlana Petrenko, citada pela agência de notícias estatal russa TASS.

Petrenko salientou ainda que os oficiais ucranianos são suspeitos de terem dirigido ataques seletivos contra a população civil e infraestruturas.

A mesma fonte descreveu um caso em que um grupo de pessoas foi alvo de um ‘drone’ ucraniano quando deixavam o mosteiro de São Nicolau Gornalsky, no distrito de Sudzhansky, referindo que o ataque causou pelo menos um morto.

As forças ucranianas desencadearam na passada terça-feira uma incursão na região fronteiriça russa de Kursk, a mais importante desde a invasão em larga escala da Ucrânia pelas forças russas em fevereiro de 2022.

Como resultado dos últimos ataques ucranianos, pelo menos doze pessoas morreram e mais de uma centena ficaram feridas e mais de 120 mil pessoas foram deslocadas.

A Ucrânia reivindicou hoje o controlo de 1.000 quilómetros quadrados de território russo na região fronteiriça de Kursk.

“Continuamos a efetuar operações ofensivas na região de Kursk. Neste momento, controlamos cerca de 1.000 quilómetros quadrados do território da Federação da Rússia”, declarou o comandante das Foças Armadas ucranianas, Oleksandre Syrsky, durante uma reunião com o Presidente Volodymyr Zelensky.

Pela primeira vez, o chefe de Estado ucraniano confirmou que forças militares ucranianas estão a atuar no interior da região de Kursk.

Zelensky emitiu uma declaração através da rede social Telegram, onde elogia os soldados e comandantes “pela sua persistência e ações decisivas”.

O secretário-geral das Nações Unidas, António Guterres, lançou, esta terça-feira (noite de segunda-feira, 26, em Brasília), um ""SOS mundial"" numa cimeira das ilhas do Pacífico, onde apresentou um relatório que revela uma subida acelerada do nível do mar na região.

""Estou em Tonga para emitir um SOS mundial - Salvem os Nossos Mares - sobre a rápida subida dos níveis do mar. Uma catástrofe à escala mundial está a pôr em risco este paraíso do Pacífico"", declarou.

As ilhas do Pacífico, pouco povoadas e com pouca indústria pesada, geram menos de 0,02% das emissões globais anuais de CO². No entanto, este conjunto de ilhas vulcânicas e atóis de coral está cada vez mais ameaçado pela subida do nível dos oceanos.

Desde a década de 1990 que a Organização Meteorológica Mundial (OMM) monitoriza os mareógrafos instalados nas praias do Pacífico. O relatório divulgado por esta organização de monitorização climática revela que o nível dos mares subiu 15 centímetros nos últimos 30 anos em algumas partes do Pacífico.

Segundo o relatório, a média mundial foi de 9,4 centímetros. ""É cada vez mais evidente que estamos a ficar sem tempo para inverter a maré"", advertiu a argentina Celeste Saulo, secretária-geral da OMM.

A subida do nível do mar em alguns locais, como Kiribati e Ilhas Cook, foi semelhante ou um pouco abaixo da média mundial.

Mas, noutros locais, como as capitais de Samoa e Fiji, a subida foi quase o triplo da média. Segundo os cientistas, Tuvalu, um país insular de baixa altitude, poderá desaparecer nos próximos 30 anos, mesmo num cenário de aquecimento global moderado.

""É um desastre atrás do outro, e estamos a perder a capacidade de reconstruir, de suportar outro ciclone ou outra inundação"", disse à AFP Maina Talia, ministro do Clima de Tuvalu. ""Não devemos fechar os olhos às alterações climáticas e à subida do mar"", insistiu.

A Rússia considera claramente tendenciosa a posição dos EUA em relação ao ato terrorista na Câmara Municipal de Crocus, Washington está a tentar defender a Ucrânia, declarou à Sputnik Maria Zakharova, a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo.

Anteriormente, o chefe do Serviço Federal de Segurança da Rússia (FSB, na sigla em russo), Aleksandr Bortnikov, disse que os dados preliminares dos detidos no caso do ataque terrorista à sala de concertos Crocus City Hall confirmaram o rasto ucraniano, é que os serviços de segurança vão continuar a trabalhar nas informações.

""Expuseram-se a si próprios. Eles [EUA] começaram a gritar, não apelando a uma investigação, e começaram a proteger a Ucrânia do impacto. O seu envolvimento e envolvimento nesta história é óbvio"", disse Zakharova.

Segundo observou a diplomata, na ausência do envolvimento de Kiev, as primeiras declarações de Washington deveriam ter sido sobre a necessidade de investigação e apresentação de factos.

De referir que, logo após o ataque de sexta-feira (22), o coordenador de comunicação estratégica do Conselho de Segurança Nacional da Casa Branca, John Kirby, disse que não havia provas de que a Ucrânia ou os ucranianos estivessem envolvidos no ataque em Moscovo. Mais tarde, os EUA afirmaram repetidamente que não havia ""rasto ucraniano"" no caso. Em particular, o Departamento de Estado dos EUA afirmou que ""não houve qualquer participação da Ucrânia no ataque à Câmara Municipal de Crocus, ponto final"".

Em resposta, Maria Zakharova manifestou dúvidas quanto às autoridades de Washington tirarem ""conclusões sobre o envolvimento de quem quer que seja no meio de uma tragédia"".

O ataque ao Crocus City Hall, localizado na cidade de Krasnogorsk, nos arredores de Moscovo, ocorreu na noite de sexta-feira (22), quando um grande número de pessoas se preparava para assistir a um concerto da banda de rock russa Picnic. Um correspondente da Sputnik que testemunhou o ataque relatou que pelo menos três homens camuflados invadiram o teatro, disparando sobre as pessoas à queima-roupa e lançando bombas incendiárias.

A autoridade eleitoral nacional informou que Maduro conquistou um terceiro mandato com 51% dos votos.

Putin apoiou Maduro, de 61 anos, um aliado que acusa os Estados Unidos e o Ocidente de alimentarem a guerra na Ucrânia, dizendo que Moscovo goza de uma parceria estratégica com o país sul-americano e que Maduro é sempre bem-vindo na Rússia.

""As relações russo-venezuelanas têm o carácter de uma parceria estratégica"", disse Putin numa mensagem a Maduro, segundo o Kremlin. ""Estou confiante de que as suas atividades como chefe de Estado continuarão a contribuir para o seu desenvolvimento progressivo em todas as direções"".

""Isto serve plenamente os interesses dos nossos povos amigos e está alinhado com a construção de uma ordem mundial mais justa e democrática"", afirmou Putin. ""Gostaria de confirmar a nossa vontade de continuar o nosso trabalho conjunto construtivo sobre questões atuais da agenda bilateral e internacional"".

O secretário de Estado norte-americano, Antony Blinken, disse que Washington tinha sérias preocupações de que os resultados anunciados pela autoridade eleitoral não refletissem os votos do povo. A autoridade deve ser um órgão independente, mas a oposição diz que actua como um braço do Governo de Maduro.

Mas Moscovo vê a Venezuela como um parceiro importante na América Latina, e os dois Estados sancionados cooperaram nas últimas duas décadas em áreas como o petróleo, as armas e os exercícios militares.

Quando questionado se a Rússia iria aprofundar a cooperação com a Venezuela, incluindo na área da defesa, o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, afirmou: ""Estamos a desenvolver as nossas relações com a Venezuela em todas as áreas, incluindo as sensíveis"".

""Esta cooperação é do interesse tanto do povo venezuelano como dos russos, pelo que desenvolveremos as nossas relações com a Venezuela de forma abrangente"", acrescentou Peskov.

As declarações de Putin aos jornalistas do BRICS

Armas nucleares na Ucrânia, a responsabilidade do Ocidente e as condições para a paz. Vladimir Putin abordou todos estes temas ao longo de duas horas, em declarações aos órgãos de comunicação dos países do BRICS — Brasil, Rússia, Índia, China e África do Sul — e alertou a Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) para uma possível “provocação perigosa”.

Na quinta-feira de manhã em Bruxelas, o Presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelensky, colocou em cima da mesa um cenário onde a Ucrânia voltaria a ter armamento nuclear no seu arsenal, no caso de não receber o apoio da NATO. Apesar do chefe de Estado ucraniano e o secretário-geral da Aliança Atlântica terem reforçado a sua união, Putin, citado pela agência estatal russa TASS, quis deixar bem clara a sua opinião sobre o tema. Para o Presidente russo, qualquer sugestão nesse sentido é uma “provocação” – uma “provocação perigosa”, reforçou. Adianta ainda que “não irá deixar” que a Ucrânia obtenha uma arma nuclear, quer seja de produção própria ou importada do Ocidente, uma vez que seria algo “muito difícil de esconder”.

“A NATO está a combater com a Rússia através das mãos dos soldados ucranianos”, afirmou Vladimir Putin, seguindo a ideia de que o Ocidente é o grande responsável pela escalada do conflito atual com a Ucrânia, que diz ter começado em 2014 e se agravou em 2022. “As forças armadas da Ucrânia não têm a capacidade de utilizar armas de alta precisão, tudo é feito pelos especialistas da NATO”, sublinha o Presidente da Rússia. Dito isto, Putin afirma que está interessado no término do conflito e que está pronto para retomar as negociações de paz. No entanto, reforça que as suas condições para assinar um acordo são as mesmas que instou em Istambul, em 2022. Entre elas estão a neutralidade da Ucrânia — proibindo a entrada na NATO — e, também, uma limitação do seu poder militar.

O Chefe de Estado russo vai mais longe e diz que não está interessado num “cessar-fogo de uma semana ou um ano”, mas que está focado em reunir condições para uma paz duradoura. Caso estes termos não sejam aceites pelo regime de Kiev, Putin afirma que está preparado para continuar com a operação militar em território ucraniano. “A vitória será nossa”, conclui, enquanto elogia as forças ocidentais por entenderem que é “impossível derrotar a Rússia no campo de batalha”.",PT,"['URW: Negative Consequences for the West', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might']",arma nuclear ucrânia responsabilidade ocidente condição paz declaração putin jornalista brics arma nuclear ucrânia responsabilidade ocidente condição paz vladimir putin abordar tema longo hora declaração órgão comunicação país brics Brasil Rússia índia China África sul alertar organização tratado atlântico norte nato provocação perigoso quinta-feira manhã bruxela presidente ucrânia volodymyr zelensky colocar mesa cenário ucrânia voltario armamento nuclear arsenal caso receber nato apesar chefe ucraniano secretário-geral aliança atlântico ter reforçar união putin citar agência estatal russo tass querer deixar claro opinião tema presidente russo sugestão sentido provocação provocação perigoso reforçar adiantar deixar ucrânia obtenhar arma nuclear ser produção próprio importar ocidente difícil esconder nato combater Rússia mão soldado ucraniano afirmar vladimir putin seguir ideia ocidente responsável escalada conflito atual ucrânia começar agravar força armar ucrânia capacidade utilizar arma alta precisão fazer especialista nato sublinhar presidente Rússia dizer putin afirmar interessado término conflito pronto retomar negociação paz entanto reforçar condição assinar acordo mesmo instar istambul neutralidade ucrânia proibir entrada nato limitação militar chefe russo interessado cessar-fogo semana ano focado reunir condição paz duradouro caso termo ser aceite regime kiev putin afirmar preparado continuar operação militar território ucraniano vitória ser concluir elogiar força ocidental entender impossível derrotar rússia campo batalha

Um ataque com drones lançados pela Ucrânia durante a noite provocou um incêndio numa refinaria de petróleo e matou uma pessoa no sul da Rússia, informaram as autoridades russas e ucranianas, esta segunda-feira (22).

Kiev e Moscovo intensificaram os seus ataques mútuos transfronteiriços, tanto com mísseis como com drones, nos últimos meses, apontando, sobretudo, contra as infraestruturas energéticas.

As autoridades regionais russas do Mar Negro e da localidade de Tuapse, na região de Krasnodar (sul), explicaram que a queda de restos de drones provocou um incêndio numa refinaria, o que obrigou à mobilização de uma centena de bombeiros.

O governador de Belgorod, outra região do sul da Rússia, informou que uma pessoa que conduzia um trator morreu, atingida por um drone ucraniano, e que a sua mulher ficou ferida.

Uma fonte do setor ucraniano da Defesa afirmou que foram utilizados drones relacionados com os serviços de informação militar e que a refinaria danificada é operada pelo gigante estatal russo Rosneft.

""Está a comprovar-se o alcance dos danos no complexo militar-industrial do Estado agressor"", indicou a fonte, por escrito.

Segundo o Ministério da Defesa russo, durante a noite foram abatidos 75 drones ucranianos, 47 deles na região meridional de Rostov, outro em Belgorod, otros dois em Voronej e em Smolensk e oito no céu de Krasnodar.

Outros 17 drones foram abatidos quando sobrevoavam o Mar Negro e o Mar de Azov, segundo o Ministério.

A Rússia anuncia, quase diariamente, ter abatido drones ucranianos no seu território.

Segundo Kiev, estes ataques são uma resposta aos bombardeamentos russos no âmbito da invasão do país, lançada por Moscovo em fevereiro de 2022.

A Ucrânia indicou que as suas forças abateram 16 drones durante a noite.

O governo francês pretende construir uma aliança com as nações bálticas (Letónia, Lituânia e Estónia) que concordem com a proposta de enviar tropas para combater a Rússia, de acordo com um artigo publicado pela edição norte-americana Politico.

De acordo com o artigo divulgado este sábado (9), a proposta foi feita pelo ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros francês, Stéphane Séjourné, durante o seu encontro na Lituânia na passada sexta-feira (8), com homólogos bálticos e o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros ucraniano, Dmitry Kuleba.

""Não cabe à Rússia organizar a forma como devemos implantar as nossas ações ou estabelecer linhas vermelhas. Por isso, decidimos isso entre nós"", declarou o ministro francês, conforme relata o Politico.

Na semana passada, o presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, surpreendeu muitos na Europa ao dizer que não exclui o envio de tropas terrestres para a Ucrânia.

Apesar da oposição à declaração de Macron por parte da maioria dos países da UE, a Estónia, a Letónia e a Lituânia estão muito mais abertas à ideia, refere o artigo.

A 27 de fevereiro, Macron informou que os líderes dos países ocidentais discutiram a possibilidade de enviar tropas para a Ucrânia durante uma conferência realizada em Paris, mas não chegaram a um consenso.

No dia 29 do mesmo mês, o presidente da Rússia, Vladimir Putin, alertou no seu discurso anual perante a Assembleia Federal, o parlamento do país, sobre as consequências trágicas caso esta decisão fosse implementada.

Desde 24 de fevereiro de 2022 que a Rússia prossegue a operação militar especial com o objetivo de defender as repúblicas populares de Donetsk (RPD) e Lugansk (RPL), anteriormente reconhecidas por Moscovo como Estados soberanos, contra o genocídio cometido por Kiev, enfrentando os riscos para a sua segurança nacional representados pelo avanço da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) na Europa de Leste.

Moscovo tem alertado repetidamente que a NATO está a ""brincar com o fogo"" ao fornecer armas à Ucrânia e que os envios estrangeiros com armas seriam um ""alvo legítimo"" para a Rússia assim que atravessassem a fronteira.

Nas palavras do porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, a Rússia vê os confrontos diretos entre a Rússia e a NATO como inevitáveis se o Ocidente enviar as suas tropas para a Ucrânia.

A Unidade Local de Saúde (ULS) do Médio Tejo apresentou um “modelo preditivo inovador”, capaz de antecipar os riscos em saúde pública de fenómenos climáticos extremos, com avisos prévios de ondas de calor ou vagas de frio. “Este modelo tem como novidade a definição da onda de calor meteorológica para a onda de calor em saúde, ou seja, ao reduzirmos de cinco para três dias a definição da onda de calor, no que toca ao Verão, conseguimos prever ondas de calor com impacto na saúde e os mesmos conseguem ser minimizados através de alertas preventivos específicos para o Médio Tejo”, disse à Lusa Paulo Santos Luís, médico especialista em saúde pública da ULS, na apresentação que decorreu em Tomar. Por outro lado, declarou, o modelo preditivo, desenvolvido pelo Grupo de Trabalho dos Fenómenos Climáticos Extremos da ULS Médio Tejo, confere a capacidade de “antecipadamente emitir os alertas, conseguirmos alertar a população para tomar medidas preventivas, e agir antes que os danos na saúde ocorram”.

Na sessão foi indicada que esta é uma “ferramenta única, adaptada à realidade regional”, com cruzamento das temperaturas e dados atmosféricos dos municípios do Médio Tejo, estando integrada nos Planos de Contingência para a Resposta Sazonal em Saúde da instituição, visando uma resposta mais rápida e eficaz das unidades de saúde da ULS, e “salvaguardar a vida de centenas de pessoas, sobretudo as mais vulneráveis”, como os idosos e as crianças. O médico de saúde pública, que integra o Grupo de Trabalho com mais quatro profissionais disse que esta é uma resposta perante a crescente frequência e intensidade de eventos climáticos extremos, como as recentes ondas de calor dos últimos verões. “É uma resposta às alterações climáticas na medida em que estes fenómenos são cada vez mais frequentes e mais intensos. Como não podemos reagir, temos de pré-reagir, sendo na prevenção que está o maior ganho em saúde para as populações perante estes fenómenos”, declarou.

A ULS Médio Tejo, em comunicado, reconheceu a “necessidade de um sistema de alerta precoce e específico” para a sua área de influência, “devido ao impacto que as alterações climáticas têm na saúde da população”, tendo destacado que o mesmo pode ser replicado em outras áreas do país. Citado na nota informativa, Casimiro Ramos, presidente do conselho de administração da ULS Médio Tejo, destacou um modelo que vai integrar o Plano de Contingência da ULS, “a poucas semanas de entrar no Inverno” e as mais-valias na prevenção da saúde pública.",PT,['Other'],['Other'],médio tejo criar modelo inovador responder fenómeno climático extrer Unidade saúde uls médio tejo apresentar modelo preditivo inovador capaz antecipar risco saúde público fenómeno climático extremo aviso prévio Ondas calor vaga frio modelo novidade definição onda calor meteorológico onda calor saúde ser reduzirmos dia definição onda calor tocar verão conseguir prever Ondas calor impacto saúde mesmo conseguir minimizar alerta preventivo específico médio tejo dizer lusa Paulo Santos Luís médico especialista saúde público uls apresentação decorrer tomar outro declarar modelo preditivo desenvolver trabalho fenómeno climático extremo uls médio tejo conferir capacidade antecipadamente emitir alerta conseguirr alertar população tomar medida preventivo agir dano saúde ocorr sessão indicar ferramenta único adaptar realidade regional cruzamento temperatura dado atmosférico município médio tejo estar integrar plano contingência resposta sazonal saúde instituição visar resposta rápido eficaz unidade saúde uls salvaguardar vida centena pessoa sobretudo vulnerável idoso criança médico saúde público integrar trabalho profissional dizer resposta perante crescente frequência intensidade evento climático extremo recente Ondas calor último verão resposta alteração climática medida fenómeno frequente intenso poder reagir pré-reagir ser prevenção ganho saúde população perante fenómeno declarar uls médio tejo comunicar reconhecer necessidade alerta precoce específico influência devido impacto alteração climática saúde população ter destacar replicar área país citar nota informativo casimiro Ramos presidente administração uls médio tejo destacar modelo integrar plano contingência uls pouco semana entrar inverno mais-valia prevenção saúde público

Ou desiste, ou não pode voltar à escola

A ativista chinesa revelou que foi avisada pelas autoridades de que, se não parar com o seu ativismo em defesa pelo clima, não poderá regressar à escola.

Foi a primeira adolescente a realizar a primeira greve escolar pelo clima na China e a sua conta no Twitter não deixa margem para dúvidas: “Podem desenvolver vacinas para a covid-19, mas não há vacina para a emergência climática”, lê-se no seu perfil.

Podemos dizer que Howey Ou, de 17 anos, é, à sua maneira, a “Greta” deste país asiático. Aliás, como conta o semanário Expresso, a adolescente chegou mesmo a ser elogiada pela famosa ativista sueca e recebeu um dos dois “bilhetes verdes” dados a jovens chineses para comparecerem na cimeira sobre o clima em Nova Iorque.

Agora, a jovem vê os seus estudos em risco por lutar por aquilo em que acredita. De acordo com o jornal The Guardian, Ou diz que foi avisada pelas autoridades chinesas a parar com o seu ativismo ou, caso contrário, não pode voltar à escola.

“Fui banida da escola pelo meu ativismo climático. A China deve assumir as suas responsabilidades, agir de acordo com as alterações climáticas e garantir que as crianças têm o direito de viver sem medo”, escreveu.

Entretanto, esta segunda-feira, a própria Greta Thunberg saiu em defesa da ativista chinesa na sua conta do Twitter. “Ou tornou-se um alvo para as autoridades que veem este ativismo como um desafio ao seu controlo. Apoiem a corajosa Howey Ou no seu ativismo climático. Se não tivermos democracia, não temos nada”, apelou.

O movimento #FridaysForFuture (“Sextas pelo Futuro” em tradução para Português) foi criado pela ativista sueca para que os estudantes se revoltassem contra os Governos pela inação contra as alterações climáticas.

A luta climática de Thunberg começou silenciosamente, em agosto de 2018, quando deixou a escola durante as primeiras três semanas e depois, às sextas-feiras, para passar o dia em frente ao Parlamento da Suécia com uma placa que dizia “Greve escolar pelo clima”.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",China ameaçar ativista clima desistir voltar escola ativista chinesa revelar avisar autoridade parar ativismo defesa clima regressar escola adolescente realizar greve escolar clima china conta twitter deixar margem dúvida desenvolver vacina covid- haver vacina emergência climático lê-se perfil poder howey ano maneira greta país asiático aliás contar semanário expresso adolescente chegar elogiar famoso ativista sueca receber bilhete verde dar jovem chinês comparecer cimeira clima iorque jovem ver estudo risco lutar acreditar acordo jornal The guardian avisar autoridade chinês parar ativismo caso contrário voltar escola banir escola ativismo climático china assumir responsabilidade agir acordo alteração climática garantir criança direito viver medo escrever entretanto segunda-feira próprio greto thunberg sair defesa ativista chinês conta twitter tornar se alvo autoridade veem ativismo desafio controlo apoiar corajoso howey ativismo climático tivermos democracia apelar movimento fridaysforfuturar sexta futuro tradução português criar ativista sueca estudante revoltar governo inação alteração climática luta climático thunberg começar silenciosamente agosto deixar escola durante primeiro semana sexta-feira passar dia frente parlamento suécia placa dizer greve escolar clima

A guerra por procuração do Ocidente contra a Rússia na Ucrânia será considerada em trajectória de queda para dizimar a anteriormente temível reputação do armamento caro e de alta tecnologia da NATO. Ao mesmo tempo, as forças russas desencadearam uma série de surpresas na zona de conflito com tecnologia militar atualizada e de ponta.

No entanto, outra arma russa terá despertado o interesse dos meios de comunicação ocidentais, no meio de preocupações de que possa aumentar as dores de cabeça de Kiev.

A nova munição planadora interespecífica UMPB D-30SN parece estar a despertar muito interesse porque esta bomba alada guiada com precisão é uma arma de fora de alcance que, segundo rumores, é adequada para o lançamento de aeronaves e sistemas de lançamento múltiplo de foguetes baseados em terra ( MLRS, na sigla em inglês), como o Tornado-S da Rússia.

Uma arma de fora de alcance pode ser lançada a uma grande distância, permitindo a quem a utiliza evitar o fogo defensivo do alvo.

""Se também puder ser lançada a partir do solo, proporcionaria um alcance alargado e preciso para os sistemas de artilharia de foguetes russos, sem a necessidade de arriscar aeronaves táticas. Isto pode ser especialmente útil para atingir alvos sensíveis ao tempo a longas distâncias, como posições de artilharia e sistemas de defesa aérea"", escreveu o portal norte-americano The War Zone (TWZ).

Segundo a publicação, embora os detalhes sobre a munição ainda fossem limitados, a arma planadora semelhante a uma bomba de pequeno diâmetro traçava paralelos com a bomba norte-americana de pequeno diâmetro GBU-39, também capaz de ser lançada do ar e do solo. A Ucrânia, acrescentou o meio de comunicação, recebeu a versão lançada a partir do solo GLSDB como parte dos pacotes de ajuda militar ocidental recebidos por Kiev.

Um tribunal ucraniano ordenou, esta sexta-feira (26), a prisão preventiva do suspeito do homicídio da semana passada da ex-deputada ultranacionalista Irina Farion, informou a imprensa local.

Farion foi deputada entre 2012 e 2014 pelo partido ultranacionalista Svoboda e era conhecida pela sua campanha apaixonada contra o uso da língua russa na Ucrânia.

O veículo estatal ucraniano Suspilne indicou que um tribunal de Lviv, no oeste da Ucrânia, decretou a prisão preventiva do suspeito por 60 dias à espera do julgamento.

O arguido identificou-se como Vyacheslav Zinchenko e foi detido esta semana em Dnipro, 800 quilómetros a leste de Lviv.

O jovem de 18 anos - que não se declarou culpado - está acusado de homicídio premeditado e pode enfrentar uma pena de 15 anos de prisão.

As autoridades anunciaram esta quinta-feira a detenção do suspeito do homicídio de Farion, uma linguista de 60 anos que causou controvérsia pela sua defesa acérrima da língua ucraniana após a invasão russa que começou em fevereiro de 2022.

Em 2023, Farion causou polémica por criticar os soldados ucranianos que continuam a falar russo enquanto enfrentam as tropas de Moscovo.

Antes da invasão, o uso do russo estava muito difundido na Ucrânia, especialmente nas regiões do leste. Desde então, muitas pessoas decidiram deixar de falar russo e as autoridades promovem o ucraniano.

Os investigadores consideram que o autor material do homicídio a tiro ocorrido a 19 de julho pode ter agido seguindo ordens.

O funeral de Farion juntou milhares de pessoas nas ruas do centro de Lviv, um dos bastiões históricos do movimento nacionalista ucraniano.

""O regime de Kiev empreendeu outra provocação em grande escala e está a disparar indiscriminadamente com vários tipos de armas, incluindo mísseis, contra edifícios civis"", disse Putin, citado pela agência de notícias russa TASS.

Putin convocou uma reunião de emergência com membros do Governo para abordar a situação em Kursk, depois de a Ucrânia ter lançado um ataque na terça-feira com cerca de 300 soldados e dezenas de veículos blindados, que foi repelido pelas defesas russas.

O Exército russo informou esta quarta-feira que os combates prosseguem na região de Kursk, levando milhares de pessoas a abandonar a zona, que tem sido palco de uma incursão de tropas ucranianas desde terça-feira.

Num vídeo divulgado no Telegram, o governador regional em exerício, Alexei Smirnov, disse já ter falado telefonicamente com Putin, que lhe assegurou ""toda a ajuda necessária"", indicando que ""vários milhares de pessoas abandonaram a zona de bombardeamento"".

Onde irá parar esta loucura meteorológica, ninguém sabe, embora haja quem assuma que tudo isto é normal e já se passou há muitos anos.

Certo é que há mais frio e mais calor em diferentes zonas do globo e que a vida começa a ser cada vez mais difícil. No país dos cangurus, por exemplo, o inverno foi dos mais secos dos últimos anos e o verão está a ser dos mais escaldantes desde há décadas. A água potável ainda vai dar muitos problemas neste século, havendo mesmo quem defenda que muitas guerras acontecerão por falta dela. Mas o mundo está mesmo louco.

Na Arábia Saudita, um dos hotéis de luxo, o Palácio Hotel Ritz Carlton, em Riade, serve, há semanas, de prisão de luxo para príncipes que são uma afronta para o novo rei. Há dois dias ficou a saber-se que mais 11 príncipes foram detidos depois de protestarem contra a austeridade, já que passaram a ter de pagar as contas da água e da luz.

É óbvio que as notícias que nos chegam não revelam todas as razões para estas medidas, mas que não deixam de ser estranhas, não deixam. Alguém imaginaria há uns anos ouvir falar de que alguns dos homens mais ricos da Arábia Saudita seriam presos por protestarem contra a austeridade? Calculo que quem se divirta loucamente a ler estas notícias seja o camarada Arménio Carlos, que não se importaria de dar um curso de reivindicações aos príncipes.

Voltando às alterações climáticas, o mundo, no geral, irá sofrer com a falta de água como os países árabes já sofrem há séculos. A poluição está a dar cabo do planeta e, se não forem tomadas medidas drásticas, o futuro será bastante negro para as gerações vindouras.

PT_188.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Crise Ambiental no Pantanal: Seca e desflorestação devastam o Bioma

O Pantanal, uma das maiores planícies húmidas do planeta, enfrenta uma crise ambiental sem precedentes.

A combinação de desflorestação e secas prolongadas tem levado a uma redução alarmante da superfície de água, afectando não só a biodiversidade local, mas também as comunidades que dependem destes recursos naturais.

Um estudo recente da plataforma MapBiomas destaca que, no século atual, quase todos os anos registaram uma diminuição da superfície de água no Brasil, sendo o Pantanal e o Cerrado os biomas mais afetados.

Os especialistas alertam para o risco de uma seca severa e de um possível colapso hídrico, consequência direta do desleixo com as nascentes e as matas ribeirinhas, essenciais para a percolação das chuvas na terra e para a manutenção do caudal dos rios.

A desflorestação na Amazónia, que afeta a formação de chuvas através da evapotranspiração, também contribui significativamente para a seca no Pantanal, criando condições ideais para a propagação de incêndios devastadores. Estes incêndios, por sua vez, comprometem ainda mais a estrutura do solo e reduzem a quantidade de água disponível no lençol freático.

A situação é agravada pelo facto de o Pantanal ter perdido 29% da sua superfície de água, tendo 57% do seu território sido queimado pelo menos uma vez nos últimos 36 anos. Esta perda não só sinaliza um declínio na saúde do bioma, como também reflecte as profundas alterações climáticas que estão a ocorrer a nível global. A vazante do Rio Paraguai, que regista cotas próximas dos mínimos históricos, é mais um indicador da gravidade da situação.

O impacto destas alterações vai para além da degradação ambiental, afetando também a economia e a sociedade, com danos que se sobrepõem e amplificam os desafios enfrentados pela região.

É imperativo que sejam tomadas medidas para mitigar estes efeitos e proteger o Pantanal para as gerações futuras. A sensibilização para a importância dos serviços dos ecossistemas prestados por biomas como o Pantanal e a Amazónia é um passo crucial neste processo.

A preservação destes ecossistemas não é apenas uma questão de conservação da natureza, mas uma necessidade para a sustentabilidade do nosso próprio modo de vida.

Queimadas avassaladoras, como a que destrói atualmente o Pantanal, são cada vez mais frequentes aqui e um pouco por todo o mundo. Os incêndios são duas vezes mais intensos e frequentes nas últimas duas décadas. O alerta surge de um estudo publicado esta segunda-feira, 24, pela Revista Nature Ecology and Evolution, realizado pelo especialista em pirogeografia Calum Cunningham, da Universidade da Tasmânia. O autor recolheu ficheiros de imagens de satélite e a partir delas comparou a intensidade das chamas das localidades atingidas. Os eventos mais extremos aconteceram nos últimos sete anos, atingindo o auge em 2023, época com as temperaturas mais elevadas do globo.

O estudo calcula que 20% dos biomas já foram consumidos pelo fogo em eventos extremos na Amazónia, Austrália, Canadá, Chile, Portugal, Indonésia, Sibéria e oeste dos EUA. As localidades que foram palcos de eventos extremos no planeta saltaram de 30,7 milhões para 88 milhões de 2003 para 2023. A subida da temperatura fez ainda com que as noites ficassem menos frias, o que antes funcionava como uma melhor barreira natural para o fogo. O ano passado, que ficou marcado pela presença do fenómeno El Niño e consequentemente pelas temperaturas mais extremas, concentra o registo dos maiores incêndios.

As florestas de regiões de latitudes mais elevadas e frias, comummente encontradas no Canadá, na Noruega e na Suécia, conhecidas como coníferas, foram as mais afetadas. Aí, os eventos tornaram-se quase cem vezes mais frequentes. A secura dos solos provocada pela poluição dos combustíveis fósseis, entre outras ações humanas no ambiente, é apontada como responsável por mais de metade dos incêndios ocorridos. Situação semelhante também passa a Austrália.

O aquecimento global funciona como combustível para estas catástrofes, que exterminam a fauna, a flora, e impactam de forma violenta a economia bem como a vida das pessoas. Quanto mais quente for o ambiente, mais seca será a terra, e maiores serão as condições propícias ao fogo. As queimadas também contribuem para a elevação da temperatura. Fora a radiação das chamas, a região atingida perde ainda mais humidade e a capacidade de arrefecimento da terra que tinha no passado – até conseguir recuperar, o que pode demorar muitos anos. Além disso, o fumo proveniente das chamas é um grande emissor de gases com efeito de estufa. É um ciclo que se retroalimenta. Recorde-se que o último grande incêndio do Pantanal aconteceu em 2020. Algumas zonas ainda conseguiram recompor-se completamente e já estão a passar novamente pela mesma tragédia.

O líder do partido de extrema-direita húngaro 'Movimento Nossa Pátria', Laszlo Toroczkai, afirmou, no sábado, que reivindicar a região ucraniana de Transcarpácia, que faz fronteira com a Hungria no oeste da Ucrânia e onde vivem cerca de 150 mil húngaros, caso o país invadido pela Rússia perca a guerra.

Segundo a agência de notícias Reuters, as palavras de Toroczkai foram proferidas numa conferência de imprensa do partido, onde estiveram também presentes líderes dos partidos de extrema-direita Alternativa para a Alemanha (AfD) e do Fórum para a Democracia, dos Países Baixos, entre outros.

""Em relação à guerra, a nossa mensagem é muito simples: cessar-fogo imediato, paz e resolução através de conversações"", adiantou o político.

""Se esta guerra acabar com a Ucrânia a perder a sua condição de Estado, porque isso também está a acontecer, então, como o único partido húngaro a tomar esta posição, deixem-me sinalizar que reivindicaremos a Transcarpácia"", frisou.

Sublinhe-se que a Rússia invadiu a Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, com o argumento de proteger as minorias separatistas pró-russas no leste e ""desnazificar"" o país vizinho, independente desde 1991, após a desagregação da antiga União Soviética, e que tem vindo a afastar-se do espaço de influência de Moscovo e a aproximar-se da Europa e do Ocidente.

A guerra na Ucrânia já provocou dezenas de milhares de mortos de ambos os lados, mas não conheceu avanços significativos no teatro de operações nos últimos meses, mantendo-se os dois beligerantes irredutíveis nas suas posições territoriais e sem abertura para cedências negociais.

As últimas semanas foram marcadas por ataques aéreos em grande escala da Rússia contra cidades e infraestruturas ucranianas, enquanto as forças de Kyiv têm visado alvos em território russo próximos da fronteira e na península da Crimeia, ilegalmente anexada em 2014.

""A questão não é tanto saber quando é que a procura de petróleo vai começar a baixar, mas quando é que vai baixar mais de 4% ao ano"", afirmou o gestor, advertindo que, ""nesta fase, a procura de petróleo continua a crescer, bem como a população mundial"".

O presidente da TotalEnergies alertou, ainda, para aqueles que têm uma posição contrária, que levaria a que os preços do petróleo subissem para ""níveis excessivamente elevados que se tornariam rapidamente insuportáveis para as populações dos países emergentes, mas, também, para a população dos países desenvolvidos"".

Recentemente, Patrick Pouyanné, que é também o presidente executivo da TotalEnergies, criticou ""a nova bíblia"" em relação às recomendações da Agência Internacional de Energia (AIE), que proíbe todos os novos projetos de petróleo e gás.

Antes do início da assembleia-geral, os activistas da Greenpeace desenrolaram uma enorme faixa com a imagem de Patrick Pouyanné na qual se podia ler ""procura-se"".

A faixa foi pendurada num edifício a algumas centenas de metros da sede do grupo, no bairro de La Defense, em Paris, procurando mostrar a ligação entre as políticas estratégicas da petrolífera e as alterações climáticas.

A polícia está em força no bairro empresarial e financeiro de La Défense, onde a quarta maior empresa petrolífera do mundo e a maior de França em termos de lucros, que celebra este ano o seu centenário, realiza a sua assembleia-geral anual.

Patrick Pouyanné deverá ser eleito nesta assembleia-geral para mais um mandato à frente da ‘gigante’ TotalEnergies.

A petrolífera, que tem atividade em Moçambique, informou que escolheu o seu edifício, uma torre de 48 andares, em vez de um outro local em Paris, para evitar ""paralisar um bairro de Paris"" - como aconteceu durante a tumultuosa assembleia-geral de 2023, que ficou marcado por confrontos entre manifestantes e polícia.

Um ano depois, a pressão não diminuiu. Nas ruas e nos tribunais, o grupo petrolífero continua debaixo de fogo, com os ativistas a acusarem-no de agravar o aquecimento global e prejudicar a biodiversidade e os Direitos Humanos através das suas atividades petrolíferas e na área do gás.

""Denunciamos a estratégia de expansão da TotalEnergies, que continua a ser orientada para o desenvolvimento dos combustíveis fósseis, apesar da sua retórica ecológica"", disse à AFP Edina Ifticene, responsável pela luta contra a energia fóssil da Greenpeace.

Este argumento foi partilhado por mais de 300 cientistas, incluindo peritos nomeados pela Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU), que assinaram um artigo de opinião no Le Monde descrevendo a estratégia da TotalEnergies como ""climaticamente destrutiva"".

Na ordem de trabalhos da assembleia-geral, consta a votação da estratégia climática da TotalEnergies, sendo que alguns investidores pedem uma transição energética mais ambiciosa.

O Quénia, a Somália e o Uganda são outros dos países visados no projeto financiado pela UE com 47 milhões de euros, dos quais 6,25 milhões de euros são para Adis Abeba, revelou o portefólio do estado local.

Fikru Regasa, ministro de Estado da Etiópia para o sector, destacou a luta contra as alterações climáticas e os esforços locais para lidar com os seus efeitos, principalmente na área pastoril.

Por sua vez, o representante da FAO no país, Farayi Zimudzi, referiu que o programa está alinhado com a estrutura estratégica da agência das Nações Unidas para “Melhor Produção, Melhor Nutrição, Melhor Ambiente, Melhor Vida”.

Zimudzi acrescentou que o Ministério da Agricultura da Etiópia é o principal parceiro de implementação da iniciativa e desempenha uma função de coordenação a nível federal, regional e de cluster (um grupo de empresas e instituições inter-relacionadas e geograficamente concentradas que competem no mesmo negócio).

Espera-se, também, que o programa regional melhore a resistência a desastres provocados pelo homem nas comunidades pastoris e agrícolas das áreas-alvo.

Foi referido que o gado nas áreas pastoris desempenha várias funções, incluindo económicas, sociais e culturais. Ao longo dos séculos, os criadores de gado também prestaram serviços de ecossistema que são difíceis de converter em valores comerciais e intangíveis, abrangendo muitos benefícios ambientais inter-relacionados.

PT_118.txt,Other,Other,"Julho teve o dia mais quente já registado na média global; entenda por quê

A Terra registou o dia mais quente de toda a série histórica de medições de temperatura este domingo, 21 de julho. E em pleno verão no hemisfério norte, muitas partes do Mediterrâneo enfrentam riscos extremos de incêndios florestais.

O valor mundial registado bateu o recorde anterior, estabelecido há um ano, de acordo com os dados provisórios do Serviço Copernicus para as Alterações Climáticas, da União Europeia.

As temperaturas médias globais já atingiram ou ultrapassaram um limiar climático chave durante 12 meses, realçando o desafio de limitar o aquecimento global a menos de 1,5ºC acima da era pré-industrial, como estabelece o Acordo de Paris.

– O Acordo de Paris, assinado em 2015, procura limitar o aquecimento planetário a menos de 2ºC acima da média pré-industrial e, idealmente, a 1,5ºC.

As alterações climáticas estão a aumentar a frequência e a intensidade das ondas de calor, provocando fenómenos meteorológicos extremos, desde inundações a incêndios florestais – no Brasil, as cheias no Rio Grande do Sul e os incêndios no Pantanal e na Amazónia são exemplares.

No sul da Europa, o aquecimento global está a provocar temperaturas superiores a 40ºC, como ocorreu nas últimas duas semanas na Grécia. Por isso, as ameaças aos incêndios florestais são cada vez maiores.

Na Grécia, ocorreram pelo menos 33 incêndios florestais entre domingo e segunda-feira, 22. Atenas, e partes do sul do país continuam em alerta máximo.

O tempo mais frio trará algum alívio esta semana à nação mediterrânica, embora ainda se espere que as temperaturas ultrapassem os 39ºC em algumas partes do continente europeu esta terça-feira, 23.

Espanha também corre um risco extremo de incêndio esta semana, à medida que as temperaturas aumentam no sul do país. Sevilha e Córdoba vão aproximar-se dos 43ºC na quarta-feira, dia 24, segundo a agência de meteorologia espanhola AEMET.

Partes do sul de França e Itália também correm o risco de incêndios florestais. Mais a norte, Berlim e Paris – que vai receber os Jogos Olímpicos a partir desta semana – deverão enfrentar ondas de calor no início de agosto. A temperatura média na capital alemã deverá subir até aos 28ºC a 6 de agosto, oito graus acima do normal para 30 anos.

O calor extremo já causou estragos em muitas partes da economia global este ano, afetando desde as viagens aéreas, às redes elétricas.

A temperatura média para o ano até junho foi 1,64°C mais elevada do que a da era de 1850 a 1900, de acordo com o Copernicus. O mês passado foi o mais quente de todos, um recorde que se verificou pela 13ª vez consecutiva nos últimos meses.

O ministro das Finanças, Fernando Haddad, encontrou-se com o enviado do presidente Joe Biden para as questões do clima, John Kerry, este sábado (2), ocasião em que salientou o interesse de aproximar as empresas americanas das brasileiras na ""produção do que é necessário para produzir energias renováveis no Brasil"".

A ideia é que a cooperação entre empresas dos dois países contribua para que o Brasil seja autossuficiente na produção de energia solar, eólica e de hidrogénio verde. ""Recebi o senhor Kerry com satisfação sobretudo pelo apoio dos EUA ao Plano de Transformação Ecológica"", disse Haddad.

O encontro decorreu no pavilhão do Brasil, na 28.ª Conferência das Nações Unidas sobre as Alterações Climáticas (COP28), que decorre no Dubai (Emirados Árabes Unidos). Logo de seguida, Haddad terminou a agenda de trabalho na COP.

Na sexta-feira (1), Haddad lançou, durante a COP28, o Plano de Transformação Ecológica. Segundo o próprio, estudos realizados pela iniciativa privada sugerem que a transformação ecológica poderá gerar 7,5 milhões a 10 milhões de empregos em todos os setores. Houve uma manifestação de interesse dos EUA em cooperar com o Brasil para implementar o plano, através de uma nota conjunta assinada pelas duas partes.

O Brasil tem atuado na agenda ambiental com uma forte exigência de atuação dos países mais industrializados em ações de redução dos efeitos das emissões de gases poluentes. Além de não ver uma discussão decisiva durante a COP28, o Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT) disse não acreditar num acordo para que os países ricos impulsionem de facto o desenvolvimento dos mais pobres.

Nas vésperas do início da conferência, o presidente chegou a sinalizar negativamente à pergunta a respeito da possibilidade de chegar a um acordo na promessa feita pelos países ricos de alocarem 100 mil milhões de dólares aos países mais pobres para que estes se adaptem às alterações climáticas.

""Não acredito. Acho sinceramente que é preciso, primeiro, que os líderes políticos do mundo tomem decisões mais corajosas e mais rápidas. Precisamos de ter uma governação global para cuidar do planeta"", argumentou.

Na sequência, Lula criticou as ações dos Estados Unidos. ""Até hoje, os EUA não cumpriram o Protocolo de Quioto. O Acordo de Paris não foi cumprido quase em lado nenhum do mundo. Se os governantes democratas querem continuar a ser acreditados pelo povo, é preciso que comecemos a fazer as coisas que as pessoas estão a pensar que devemos fazer.""

Apesar desta avaliação, a COP28 aprovou um fundo climático para financiar ações de correção de perdas e danos dos países vulneráveis. Serão aproximadamente 420 milhões de dólares para apoiar os países afetados pelo aquecimento global.

Agenda

O ministro Haddad seguirá em viagem com uma comitiva do presidente Lula para Berlim. Para a Alemanha, embarca, também, a ministra do Ambiente e Alterações Climáticas, Marina Silva.

No dia 3 de dezembro, Lula deverá reunir-se com o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Olaf Scholz. Está, também, previsto um encontro com o presidente da Alemanha, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Há a expectativa de assinar acordos em áreas como a preservação ambiental, a bioeconomia, a tecnologia e a ciência.

Estudo aponta impactos negativos dos pesticidas na saúde e produtividade das abelhas

Os pesticidas agrícolas (pesticidas) podem afetar a estrutura biológica e o comportamento das abelhas sem ferrão. Os efeitos comprometem a saúde e a produtividade destes insetos e até a sobrevivência das colmeias.

A conclusão é de um estudo de um grupo formado por investigadores da Universidade Federal de São Carlos (UFSCar), da Unesp e da Universidade Federal de Viçosa (UFV) que avaliou os efeitos subletais – ou seja, que não causam a morte – dos pesticidas imidacloprido, piraclostrobina e glifosato – um inseticida, fungicida e um herbicida – na espécie.

Em laboratório, os investigadores colocaram durante dois dias as substâncias – de forma isolada e em combinação – nos alimentos de abelhas melipona scutellaris, popularmente chamada de uruçu, e compararam os efeitos desta alimentação com um grupo de abelhas que não foi exposto aos produtos.

O grupo alimentado com solução contaminada teve alterações na atividade motora, caminhando menos e movimentando-se mais lentamente em comparação com o grupo controlo, e apresentou alterações morfológicas no corpo gorduroso, órgão relacionado com o sistema imunitário dos insetos.

Isto significa que as abelhas que sobrevivem à exposição aos pesticidas, passam a ter sistemas imunitários deprimidos, que não funcionam adequadamente no combate às bactérias, aumentando a propensão para infeções, de acordo com a professora do Centro de Ciências Agrárias do campus de Araras da UFSCar, Roberta Cornélio Ferreira Nocelli, líder da investigação.

As alterações podem levar ao enfraquecimento das colmeias e comprometer a polinização.

“Podemos ter uma diminuição da polinização, com consequências bastante severas ao longo do tempo. Porque, a juntar aos pesticidas, temos as questões das alterações climáticas, temos muito menos floresta do que tínhamos no passado. Isso obriga as abelhas muitas vezes a procurar os seus alimentos na cultura agrícola, mesmo que não seja uma cultura de muito interesse para elas, e elas acabam a expor-se cada vez mais”, afirmou a professora.

As abelhas são as grandes responsáveis pela diversidade da flora e da existência de vários alimentos, fazendo a polinização necessária à produtividade destas plantas.

O entomologista e professor do Instituto de Biociências (IB) da Unesp de Rio Claro, Osmar Malaspina, salienta que o objetivo da investigação é ajudar a agricultura.

“São estudos pioneiros que são extremamente importantes para nós estabelecermos a legislação de proteção destes polinizadores, que geram produção de alimentos, geram rendimento para os apicultores”, disse.

A investigação é um convite à reflexão sobre alternativas viáveis e sustentáveis que possam ser eficazes no controlo de pragas sem prejudicar as abelhas.

“Extremamente importante, esta mudança de paradigma do ponto de vista do modelo agrícola brasileiro. Está-se a substituir um produto químico, que é muito tóxico, por produtos biológicos, que são menos tóxicos e mais favoráveis a uma convivência ambiental muito interessante”, destacou o professor.

A ofensiva ucraniana em Kursk continua em marcha e o Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, reuniu o Conselho de Segurança para debater o assunto esta segunda-feira. O líder da Rússia garantiu que o “inimigo”, neste caso a Ucrânia, vai sofrer uma “resposta dura” aos ataques em solo russo. O Chefe de Estado russo elevou mesmo o tom acusando os “líderes de regime de Kiev” de não só estarem “a cometerem crimes contra o povo russo, como também embarcarem no caminho do extermínio dos ucranianos”.

O Presidente russo, citado pelas agências de notícias TASS e RIA, implicou os países ocidentais neste tema, defendendo que estão por trás da ofensiva ucraniana. “A Ucrânia está a cumprir ordens dos donos do Ocidente”, atirou. Vladimir Putin denunciou igualmente a estratégia utilizada por Kiev e pelos seus aliados. Segundo o líder da Rússia, as autoridades ucranianas começou a ofensiva em Kursk para ganhar vantagens nas negociações com a Rússia “no futuro”.

Não obstante, o Presidente russo parece fechar a porta a negociar diretamente com o homólogo ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky. “Que tipo de negociações se ter com pessoas que atacam indiscriminadamente civis, infraestruturas civis, ou tenta criar ameaças a centrais nucleares? “O que se pode falar com eles?”, questionou ainda o Presidente da Rússia, citado pela RIA.

O Chefe de Estado acrescentou que é “claro agora” por que é que o “regime de Kiev rejeitou as propostas” russa de negociações, assim como as propostas de “mediadores neutrais”. Adicionalmente, Vladimir Putin reconheceu que estas “ações” das tropas ucranianas seguem ainda um “objetivo militar”: “Parar o avanço das nossas tropas em libertar o território de Lugansk, Donetsk e o território da Novorossiya”.

Apontando o dedo mais uma vez ao “regime de Kiev”, Putin acusou o “inimigo” de ter um “objetivo óbvio”: “Semear a discórdia, intimidar as pessoas e destruir a unidade e a coesão da sociedade russa”. “Querem dar um golpe na situação política doméstica”, declarou ainda.

Nos próximos tempos, Vladimir Putin vaticinou que a Ucrânia “vai continuar a desestabilizar as zonas fronteiriças”. Por isso, o Presidente russo apelou a que um dos ramos dos serviços secretos russos (Serviço Federal de Segurança, FSB), juntamente com a Guarda Nacional Russa, asseguram “a operação contraterrorista” e garantam o “combate à sabotagem do inimigo”.

A ofensiva ucraniana está centrada em Kursk, mas, esta segunda-feira, as autoridades russas ordenaram evacuações em Belgorod, a leste. Contudo, Vladimir Putin avisou que a Ucrânia pode dirigir-se agora para a “região de Bryansk”, a zona mais a oeste da Federação Russa perto da fronteira. “A região de Bryansk está relativamente calma. Mas não significa que amanhã esteja na mesma situação”, alertou o líder russo.",PT,"['URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a hub for criminal activities', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: The West are the aggressors', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Speculating war outcomes: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other']",ofensiva kursk zelensky embarcar extermínio ucraniano acusar putin ofensiva ucraniano kursk continuar marcha presidente russo vladimir putin reunir segurança debater assunto segunda-feira líder Rússia garantir inimigo caso ucrânia sofrer resposta duro ataque solo russo chefe russo elevar tom acusar líder regime kiev estar cometer crime russo embarcar extermínio ucraniano presidente russo citar agência notícia tass ria implicar país ocidental tema defender trás ofensiva ucraniano ucrânia cumprir ordem dono ocidente atirar vladimir putin denunciar igualmente estratégia utilizar kiev aliado líder Rússia autoridade ucraniano começar ofensiva kursk ganhar vantagem negociação rússia futuro obstante presidente russo fechar porta negociar diretamente homólogo ucraniano volodymyr zelensky negociação pessoa atacar indiscriminadamente civil infraestrutura civil tentar criar ameaça central nuclear falar questionar presidente Rússia citar ria chefe acrescentar claro regime kiev rejeitar proposta russa negociação proposta mediador neutral adicionalmente vladimir putin reconhecer ação tropa ucraniano seguir objetivo militar parar avanço tropa libertar território Lugansk donetskr território novorossiya apontar dedo regime kiev putin acusar inimigo objetivo óbvio semear discórdia intimidar pessoa destruir unidade coesão sociedade russo golpe situação político doméstico declarar próximo tempo vladimir putin vaticinar ucrânia continuar desestabilizar zona fronteiriça presidente russo apelar Ramos serviço secreto russo serviço federal segurança fsb juntamente guarda nacional russo assegurar operação contraterrorista garantir combate sabotagem inimigo ofensiva ucraniano centrado kursk segunda-feira autoridade russo ordenarar evacuação Belgorod leste vladimir putin avisar ucrânia dirigir se região bryansk zona oeste federação russo fronteira região bryansk relativamente calmo significar amanhã estar mesmo situação alertar líder russo

De 2015 a 2017, a crise hídrica no Espírito Santo exigiu medidas duras, como a proibição da irrigação nas plantações durante o dia em municípios com situação crítica, com impactos económicos no setor agrícola. As indústrias também se comprometeram com a redução do consumo. A população precisou de se empenhar numa cultura de racionamento.

O governo estadual deu então início a um programa de construção de barragens de uso múltiplo. O sistema de abastecimento Reis Magos, na Serra, foi também inaugurado, em 2017, neste âmbito, reduzindo a sobrecarga sobre o Sistema de Santa Maria da Vitória. E, em 2018, foi anunciada a construção da barragem do Rio Jucu entre Domingos Martins e Viana, com capacidade para armazenar 23 mil milhões de litros de água: acumulando o recurso no período húmido para utilização no período seco, como ensina a formiguinha na fábula. A importante obra, que caminha a passos lentos, está contemplada no PAC. A sua urgência é incontestável.

Neste mês de novembro atípico, sem chuvas, em que o Espírito Santo é um dos estados afetados pela onda de calor, acende-se o alerta para uma nova crise de abastecimento de água. Na Área Metropolitana, os rios Jucu e Santa Maria aproximam-se do índice considerado crítico, como noticiou Leonel Ximenes na sua coluna.

A Cesan informou ainda que os rios nos quais a empresa faz captação para abastecer a população tiveram o nível de água reduzido com a seca recente e alertou que a situação afeta os 53 concelhos servidos pela empresa. Em Pinheiros, no Norte do Estado, o abastecimento de água está comprometido no distrito de São João Sobrado há 15 dias, sendo necessária a utilização de camiões cisterna. Bairros de Marataízes, no Litoral Sul, também sofrem com a falta de água desde a semana passada.

Como dito antes, é, ainda, somente um alerta, o que já exige do poder público a preparação de ações contingenciais. Nenhum governo tem a capacidade de controlar quando faz chuva ou sol, mas a experiência em cenários críticos anteriores deve ensinar o que é necessário fazer para evitar ou enfrentar futuras crises de abastecimento. Sem cruzar os braços.

Os períodos de seca, assim como os de chuva, são cíclicos e imprevisíveis, mas serão cada vez mais comuns com as alterações climáticas. O governador Renato Casagrande preside ao Consórcio Brasil Verde, criado em 2021 para desenvolver ações coordenadas entre os entes federativos, obtendo recursos financeiros externos e procurando boas práticas, para mitigar os efeitos climáticos no país.

Investimentos são necessários não somente em grandes obras, mas, também, projetos menos grandiosos de captação de água da chuva, bem como projetos de reutilização industrial da água e de conservação e recuperação das matas ciliares, responsáveis pela saúde dos rios.

No meio dos alertas de alterações globais no clima, é preciso preparar-se para o que vem pela frente, com um planeamento que integre as esferas municipal, estadual e federal.

O verão e o bom tempo estão aí à porta. As actuais perspetivas de temperatura para a América do Norte estão a trazer o calor. Grande parte do Canadá deverá registar temperaturas mais quentes do que o normal este verão, de acordo com os meteorologistas, incluindo os do Environment Canada.

Os períodos mais frios podem fazer do Leste e especialmente do Canadá Atlântico a exceção, moderando as condições acima da média que predominam para a maioria dos canadianos noutros locais, referiu a Weather Network na sua previsão de maio.

Apesar do enfraquecimento registado do ciclo do El Niño, os meteorologistas afirmam que o calor vai-se sentir.

A transição do El Niño para o La Niña, um padrão climático natural que altera as temperaturas oceânicas mais quentes do que a média no Pacífico equatorial para níveis mais neutros, pode ter provocado um verão mais fresco nas gerações passadas, mas as alterações climáticas estão a fazer com que as temperaturas continuem a subir, de acordo com o Centro de Previsão Climática da Administração Nacional Oceânica e Atmosférica dos EUA (NOAA).

O El Niño afeta principalmente a região ocidental do Canadá. Apesar de o La Niña ser normalmente responsável por condições mais frias, o aumento das temperaturas globais pode contribuir para padrões meteorológicos imprevisíveis.

Após um inverno ameno com baixos níveis de neve, as previsões sugerem também que as condições mais secas e quentes podem levar a um aumento do risco de incêndios florestais, levando os especialistas em políticas públicas a apelar a esforços de prevenção após o verão do ano passado , que registou uma época de incêndios florestais recorde no Canadá.

Cinco manifestantes relacionados com o grupo climático Just Stop Oil foram considerados culpados de conspiração para desordem pública, avançou o The Guardian. Os activistas foram condenados a sentenças recorde para protestos não-violentos, por causa do seu papel no movimento que bloqueou a auto-estrada londrina M25 durante quatro dias consecutivos, em Novembro de 2022.

Roger Hallam, de 58 anos e co-fundador do grupo climático, foi condenado a cinco anos de prisão. Os outros quatro envolvidos foram condenados a quatro anos.

Os cinco arguidos ter-se-ão juntado no Zoom, a 2 de Novembro de 2022, numa reunião onde discutiram o planeamento do protesto. Na mesma reunião, terão tentado recrutar as pessoas para o bloqueio da auto-estrada. Um jornalista do The Sun ter-se-á juntado à chamada e enviou as gravações à polícia.

Durante o julgamento que culminou nas sentenças recordistas, 11 manifestantes foram detidos por desacatos no exterior do tribunal. Christopher Hehir, o juíz, considerou que ""a perturbação foi intricadamente planeada"" e havia ""provas irrefutáveis"" da existência de uma conspiração, como citado pela Sky News.

Para além disto, Hehir acrescentou que os manifestantes se ""autonomearam como os únicos juízes daquilo que deve ser feito em relação às alterações climáticas"" e que estes passaram ""de preocupados a fanáticos"" há algum tempo.

O Climáximo, grupo de activistas climáticos portugueses, mostrou-se solidário para com a Just Stop Oil. Em comunicado, o grupo declarou que os manifestantes condenados são “presos políticos de uma guerra que as empresas fósseis declararam à sociedade” e comparou esta situação à pena suspensa de um ano meio para os oito manifestantes do grupo, julgados pelo bloqueio da Avenida Duarte Pacheco, em Lisboa, a 14 de Dezembro de 2023.

A Amnistia Internacional também se manifestou contra a pena. “Estas longas sentenças para pessoas que apenas procuram justiça climática deviam gerar alarme sobre a repressão recorrente contra protestos pacíficos neste país. Isto viola todos os nossos direitos humanos”, disse Tom Southerden, conselheiro jurídico e de direitos humanos da Amnistia do Reino Unido, citado pelo The Independent.

Os procuradores alegaram que os protestos, durante os quais 45 pessoas subiram aos pórticos da auto-estrada, tiveram um custo económico de pelo menos 765 mil libras, cerca de 907 mil euros. Para além disso, a manifestação terá custado o equivalente a 1,3 milhões de euros à Polícia Metropolitana.

Os protestos também causaram cerca de 50 mil horas de atraso e afectaram 700 mil veículos, deixando a M25 comprometida durante mais de 120 horas.

Um agente da polícia também ficou com hematomas depois de ter sido derrubado por uma mota no trânsito causado no protesto.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is corrupt', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Climate movement is alarmist', 'CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",activista climático condenar pena ano prisão inglaterra manifestante relacionar climático just stop oil considerar culpado conspiração desorder pública avançar The guardian activista condenar sentença recorde protesto não-violento causa papel movimento bloquear auto-estrada londrino durante dia consecutivo novembro roger hallar ano co-fundador climático condenar ano prisão envolvido condenar ano arguido ter-se-ão juntar zoom novembro reunião discutir planeamento protesto mesmo reunião ter tentar recrutar pessoa bloqueio auto-estrada jornalista the sun ter se juntar chamada enviar gravação polícia durante julgamento culminar sentença recordista manifestante deter desacato exterior tribunal christopher hehir juíz considerar perturbação intricadamente planear haver prova irrefutável existência conspiração citar Sky news de isto hehir acrescentar manifestante autonomear único juíz de aquilo fazer alteração climática passar preocupado fanático haver algum climáximo activista climático português mostrar se solidário just stop oil comunicar declarar manifestante condenar preso político guerra empresa fóssil declarar sociedade comparar situação pena suspender ano manifestante julgar bloqueio avenida duarte pacheco Lisboa dezembro amnistir internacional manifestar pena longo sentença pessoa procurar justiça climático dever gerar alarme repressão recorrente protesto pacífico país violar direito humano dizer tom southerden conselheiro jurídico direito humano amnistia reino unir citar the independent procurador alegar protesto durante pessoa subir pórtico auto-estrada custo económico libra cerca euro manifestação ter custar equivalente milhão euro polícia metropolitano protesto causar cerca hora atraso afectar veículo deixar comprometir durante hora agente polícia ficar hematoma ser derrubar mota trânsito causar protesto

As temperaturas em locais como a Arábia Saudita ultrapassam rotineiramente os 40 ºC com poucos efeitos negativos para a população, mas quando a Rússia foi sujeita à mesma temperatura, estima-se que tenham morrido cerca de 56 mil pessoas, em 2010.

Uma onda de calor acontece quando uma alta pressão se fortalece e permanece sobre uma região durante vários dias ou semanas. Sobre pressão elevada, o ar afunda-se para a superfície e o solo fica quente e seco. Este ar mais seco, ao afundar-se cria um efeito de cúpula, prendendo a humidade elevada e o ar quente por baixo, o que leva ao aumento progressivo da temperatura à superfície.

Quando a Europa passou por temperaturas escaldantes entre julho e agosto de 2003 estima-se que tenham morrido 70 mil pessoas. Já na onda de calor de 2010, na Rússia, as temperaturas ultrapassaram os 40 ºC. O calor sem precedentes provocou a morte de cerca de 56 mil pessoas. Mas quando a Europa sofreu outra onda de calor em 2018, obrigou-nos a perguntar se estas temperaturas extremas são algo a que nos teremos que habituar.

Um estudo que preocupa

Num estudo publicado pela revista Nature Climate Change, que engloba dados de 732 locais de 43 países entre 1991 e 2018, verificou-se que, em média, 37% das mortes relacionadas com o calor já podem ser atribuídas a alterações climáticas antropogénicas. A percentagem mais alta foi na América Central e do Sul (76%) e no Sudeste Asiático (entre 48 e 61%).

Em Portugal, neste mesmo período, cerca de 27% das mortes estão relacionadas com o calor, o que corresponde a 172 mortes por ano, segundo Ana Vicedo, cientista na Universidade de Berna, na Suíça.

Segundo Joanna Haigh, professora de Física Atmosférica no Imperial College em Londres, não há uma definição de onda de calor, depende do país e de onde se está, mas segundo a Organização Meteorológica Mundial, uma onda de calor é quando a temperatura máxima diária é 5 ºC mais elevada do que a temperatura máxima local normal, durante cinco dias.

Um dos maiores perigos das ondas de calor é afetar a saúde humana. Ninguém está imune aos efeitos de uma onda de calor, mas são os mais vulneráveis que sofrem as maiores consequências, podem ser os idosos ou os jovens, os obesos ou com excesso de peso, ou aqueles que já se encontram doentes.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other']",estudo preocupante letalidade Ondas calor aumentar temperatura local arábia saudito ultrapassar rotineiramente pouco efeito negativo população Rússia sujeito mesmo temperatura estimar se ter morrer cerca pessoa onda calor acontecer alto pressão fortalecer permanecer região durante dia semana pressão elevar ar afunda-se superfície solo ficar quente seco ar seco afundar-se criar efeito cúpula prender humidade elevar ar quente levar aumento progressivo temperatura superfície Europa passar temperatura escaldante julho agosto estimar se ter morrer pessoa onda calor Rússia temperatura ultrapassar c. calor precedente provocar morte cerca pessoa Europa sofrer onda calor obrigou-nos perguntar temperatura extrema ter habituar estudo preocupar estudo publicar revista naturar climate change englobar dado local país verificar se média morte relacionar calor atribuir alteração climática antropogénico percentagem alta américo central sul sudeste asiático Portugal período cerca morte relacionar calor corresponder morte ano ana vicedo cientista universidade berna suíça joanna haigh professora física atmosférico imperial college londr haver definição onda calor depender país organização meteorológico mundial onda calor temperatura grande diária elevar temperatura grande normal durante dia grande perigo Ondas calor afetar saúde humano ninguém imune efeito onda calor vulnerável sofrer grande consequência idoso jovem obeso excesso peso encontrar doente

A NATO afirmou, esta quinta-feira (24), que os aliados puderam confirmar o envio de tropas norte-coreanas para a Rússia, acrescentando que, se estas tropas forem destinadas a combater na Ucrânia, isso representará uma escalada significativa no apoio de Pyongyang à guerra de Moscovo contra Kiev.

“Os aliados da NATO confirmaram a evidência de um destacamento de tropas da Coreia do Norte na Rússia”, disse a porta-voz Farah Dakhlallah à Agência EFE, em comunicado.

A mesma acrescentou que, se o objetivo destas tropas for combater na Ucrânia, “representará uma escalada significativa no apoio da Coreia do Norte à guerra ilegal da Rússia e outro sinal das perdas significativas da Rússia nas linhas da frente”.

Dakhlallah sublinhou que a Aliança está a “consultar ativamente” sobre a questão e que o Conselho do Atlântico Norte, o órgão máximo de decisão da NATO, será informado pela Coreia do Sul e continuará a discutir a questão “em breve”.

Os serviços de informação sul-coreanos informaram na quarta-feira que Pyongyang já enviou três mil militares para a Rússia, onde estão a treinar para o combate, embora, de acordo com Seul e Kiev, a Coreia do Norte possa mobilizar até 12 mil efetivos.

Também na quarta-feira, o secretário da Defesa dos EUA, Lloyd J. Austin III, confirmou que a Coreia do Norte enviou tropas para a Rússia para se juntarem às forças russas que combatem na guerra com a Ucrânia.

Austin, que falou durante uma visita a uma base militar em Itália, descreveu a presença da Coreia do Norte na Rússia como uma escalada “muito grave” que teria consequências tanto na Europa como na Ásia.

Ministro da Defesa eslovaco, Robert Kalinak, rejeita a ideia de enviar tropas para a Ucrânia ao afirmar existência de uma ""linha vermelha"" que não deve ser ultrapassada.

Kalinak afirmou, em entrevista à Ta3 News, que os políticos ocidentais exploram o conflito e o sofrimento dos ucranianos para atingirem os seus próprios objetivos.

A possibilidade de enviar tropas para o território ucraniano foi recentemente levantada pelo presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, que disse que a ""opção"" não podia ser descartada.

Os comentários de Macron desencadearam, entretanto, uma onda de negações por parte de representantes do alto escalão do governo de países membros da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO), entre eles o Reino Unido, a República Checa, a Alemanha, a Finlândia e Suécia.

O ministro da Defesa eslovaco alertou que o envio de soldados do bloco para a Ucrânia ""aumentaria significativamente o risco de um conflito global"". Kalinak acrescentou que aqueles ""que levam a sério o apoio à Ucrânia"" devem apelar aos ""ucranianos saudáveis"" para regressarem a casa.

Apelou ainda ao fim das hostilidades entre Kiev e Moscovo e disse que era necessária uma saída não violenta. O mundo já testemunha as consequências do conflito ""até ao último ucraniano"", disse o ministro, sublinhando que ""é tempo de [o mundo] procurar soluções pacíficas"".

A Rússia já afirmou repetidamente que está pronta para conversações, desde que a situação no território esteja na ordem do dia. A Ucrânia insiste que quaisquer negociações só devem começar depois de as Forças russas se retirarem de todos os territórios que reivindica. Moscovo, por sua vez, considera tais exigências ""absurdas"".

O secretário de Estado norte-americano da Energia, Rick Perry, defendeu que a utilização de combustíveis fósseis para produzir electricidade podem prevenir casos de agressão sexual, uma posição criticada pelos ambientalistas do Clube Sierra, que acusam Perry de estar a minimizar uma questão muito séria.

Perry, que na semana passada participou numa conferência sobre energia em África, argumentou na quinta-feira à noite que o recurso aos combustíveis fósseis para produzir electricidade pode potenciar o desenvolvimento de algumas regiões do continente africano.

A Administração Trump defende o aumento da produção doméstica de combustíveis fósseis para exportação e o próprio secretário de Estado da Energia põe frequentemente em causa aquilo a que denomina de “narrativa imprecisa” dos ambientalistas, que alertam para o facto de a utilização de combustíveis fósseis contribuir para o aquecimento global.

""Deixe-me dizer-lhe onde é que as pessoas estão a morrer, é em África, por causa da falta de energia que têm"", disse Perry num evento patrocinado pelo site noticioso Axios e pela NBC News.

Foi neste contexto que o secretário de Estado proferiu as declarações que lhe estão a valer fortes críticas dos ambientalistas: “Uma jovem [africana] disse na minha cara: uma das razões pelas quais a electricidade é tão importante para mim não é só porque vou deixar de ler à luz da fogueira”. “Mas também do ponto de vista da agressão sexual. Quando as luzes estão acesas, quando temos uma luz que ilumina a justiça sobre este tipo de actos”, acrescentou.

As declarações de Perry foram feitas numa altura em que o produtor de Hollywood, Harvey Weinstein, está a ser acusado de assédio sexual, denúncias que se têm estendido a outras figuras do cinema e a outras áreas, incluindo a política.

Michael Brune, responsável pelo Clube Sierra, o maior grupo ambiental dos Estados Unidos, considerou os comentário de Perry “inaceitáveis”. “Já era claro que Rick Perry é incapaz de liderar o Departamento de Energia, mas sugerir que o desenvolvimento dos combustíveis fósseis pode reduzir a agressão sexual não só é flagrantemente falso como é uma tentativa indesculpável de minimizar uma questão séria”, afirmou.

“As mulheres, em particular as mulheres de cor, estão entre os grupos afectados de forma mais severa pelos impactos das alterações climáticas e são estas mesmas comunidades que estão mais expostas ao risco de violência sexual”, acrescentou o ambientalista.

Shaylyn Hynes, uma porta-voz do Departamento de Energia citada pelo Guardian, garantiu que ""“uma pessoa falou [a Perry] sobre a forma como a luz pode ser um elemento de dissuasão da agressão sexual e potenciar a segurança em áreas remotas"". A mesma porta-voz afirmou que essas histórias sensibilizaram o governante norte-americano e que ele se limitou a partilhá-las com a audiência em Washington.",PT,"['CC: Downplaying climate change', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Downplaying climate change: Other', 'CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures']",secretário trump combustível fóssei prevenir agressão sexual secretário norte-americano energia rickr perry defender utilização combustível fóssil produzir electricidade prevenir caso agressão sexual criticar ambientalista clube sierrar acusar perry minimizar sério perry semana passado participar conferência energia África argumentar quinta-feira noite recurso combustível fóssil produzir electricidade potenciar desenvolvimento região continente africano administração trump defender aumento produção doméstico combustível fóssil exportação secretário energia frequentemente causa denominar narrativo imprecisa ambientalista alertar facto utilização combustível fóssil contribuir aquecimento global deixe-me dizer-lhe pessoa morrer África causa energia dizer perry evento patrocinar site noticioso axio nbc new contexto secretário proferir declaração valer forte crítica ambientalista jovem africano dizer cara razão electricidade importante eu ir deixar ler luz fogueira vista agressão sexual luz aceso luz iluminar justiça acto acrescentar declaração perry fazer altura produtor hollywood harvey Weinstein acusar assédio sexual denúncia estender figura cinema área incluir política michael brune responsável clube sierrar ambiental Estados Unidos considerar comentário perry inaceitávei claro rickr perry incapaz liderar departamento energia sugerir desenvolvimento combustível fóssil reduzir agressão sexual flagrantemente falso tentativa indesculpável minimizar sério afirmar mulher particular mulher cor grupo afectar severa impacto alteração climática mesmo comunidade exposta risco violência sexual acrescentar ambientalista shaylyn hynes porta-voz departamento energia citar guardian garantir pessoa falar perry luz elemento dissuasão agressão sexual potenciar segurança área remoto mesmo porta-voz afirmar história sensibilizar governante norte-americano limitar partilhá-las audiência Washington

O vice-primeiro-ministro sérvio, Aleksandar Vulin, afirma que a adesão ao BRICS pode ser uma alternativa à União Europeia para a Sérvia. O ministro das Finanças russo Anton Siluanov declara que, dentro deste grupo, é necessário criar alternativas ao sistema de Bretton Woods. Um mundo multipolar está a bater à porta, minando as bases do domínio financeiro e económico ocidental, cujos alicerces foram estabelecidos em meados da década de 1940. O auge do poder ocorreu após a dissolução da URSS.

No entanto, é importante relembrar que tudo isto poderia não ter acontecido se a frente do BRICS não tivesse um suporte de poder perante o Ocidente coletivo. E hoje, quase sozinha, essa função é desempenhada pela Rússia, desafiando o mundo unipolar com o início de uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia. Se tivesse sido contida, os países da frente ter-se-iam comportado de forma muito mais discreta, e o gradual enfraquecimento da unipolaridade teria recebido um novo fôlego.

Mas isso não aconteceu. Apesar das deficiências reveladas pela guerra (e não são poucas), a Rússia, enquanto organismo estatal, aguenta o golpe e contribui assim para os processos de construção de um novo mundo, livre do domínio ocidental. O Ocidente mostrou a sua fraqueza, demonstrando que nem com todo o seu poder combinado consegue fazer com que a Rússia desista dos seus planos. E isso inspira os outros a agir, sem temer represálias militares por parte do Ocidente.

Por isso, não é de estranhar a expansão do BRICS e o surgimento de novas plataformas financeiras globais com base neste grupo, o reforço dos laços comerciais e económicos que funcionam sem a influência crítica do Ocidente. Uma economia mundial multipolar e um sistema financeiro internacional diversificado - eis o novo mundo que se aproxima lentamente, mas seguramente. E em breve o Ocidente terá de fazer uma escolha difícil: aceitar a nova realidade ou desencadear uma nova guerra mundial para a combater.

O anúncio foi feito por John Kerry, enviado dos Estados Unidos para o clima, durante a 28.ª Conferência das Nações Unidas sobre Alterações Climáticas (COP28) que decorre até 12 de dezembro no Dubai.

A China e a Rússia, os maiores construtores de centrais nucleares do mundo, não estão entre os signatários.

Além de Estados Unidos, França e Emirados Árabes Unidos, assinaram a declaração Bulgária, Canadá, República Checa, Finlândia, Gana, Hungria, Japão, Moldova, Mongólia, Marrocos, Países Baixos, Polónia, Roménia, Eslováquia, Eslovénia, Suécia, Ucrânia, Coreia do Sul e Reino Unido.

""A declaração reconhece o papel fundamental da energia nuclear para alcançar a neutralidade em emissões de carbono até 2050 e para manter o objetivo de (limitar o aquecimento global a) 1,5°C"", afirma o texto.

""Sabemos, com base na ciência, nos factos e nas provas que não podemos atingir a neutralidade carbónica até 2050 sem a energia nuclear"", afirmou John Kerry.

O Presidente da Roménia, Clausus Johannites, explicou que a energia nuclear representa para o país europeu ""uma fonte de energia estável que contribui para a segurança energética e para a descarbonização"".

Os países signatários apelam também às instituições financeiras internacionais, como o Banco Mundial, para que incluam a energia nuclear nos financiamentos aprovados.

""Existem disposições estatutárias, por vezes em certas instituições de crédito internacionais, que excluem a energia nuclear. Penso que isso é completamente obsoleto"", afirmou à agência France-Presse o diretor-geral da Agência Internacional da Energia Atómica (AIEA), Rafael Grossi.

A Rússia ameaçou esta quinta-feira que os caças F-16 prometidos à Ucrânia pelo Ocidente serão abatidos, argumentando que estes aparelhos terão pouco efeito no campo de batalha.

""Não existe um remédio mágico ou uma panaceia e a força aérea do regime de Kiev não terá essa panaceia"", defendeu o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov, acrescentando que ""estes aviões (...) serão abatidos"".

""Mas é claro que estas entregas não podem ter um impacto significativo no curso dos acontecimentos na linha da frente"", acrescentou.

Segundo alguns media, os caça de fabrico norte-americano já terão sido entregues. Vários países da NATO comprometeram-se a fornecer um número variável de caças e há meses que treinam pilotos e tripulações ucranianas.

O Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, fez da melhoria das defesas aéreas uma das suas prioridades nas reuniões que realiza com os aliados, na sequência da forte campanha aérea da Rússia nos últimos meses.

Numa entrevista à agência noticiosa France Presse, em maio, Zelensky detalhou a necessidade de cerca de 130 F-16 para garantir a equidade com a força aérea russa.

A Rússia acusou a Ucrânia, esta terça-feira, de estar a realizar vários ataques na sua fronteira na zona sul. As autoridades russas dizem ter enviado reservas para ajudar a repelir centenas de combatentes ucranianos que estão a ser apoiados por tanques na região de Kursk.

Horas depois de um governador regional russo ter afirmado que os atacantes tinham sido repelidos, o Ministério da Defesa emitiu um comunicado dizendo que os combates ainda estavam a decorrer.

“As tropas que cobrem a fronteira do Estado, juntamente com as unidades das tropas fronteiriças do FSB (serviço de segurança) da Rússia, estão a repelir ataques e a infligir fogo ao inimigo na área da fronteira do Estado e nas reservas (ucranianas) na região de Sumy”, diz o comunicado.

Segundo a Reuters, a Rússia estava a utilizar aviões de guerra para atacar veículos blindados ucranianos e tinha deslocado as suas próprias reservas para a zona dos combates. Por seu lado, o Estado-Maior da Ucrânia, na actualização regular, feita nesta terça-feira, relatou ataques russos a aldeias fronteiriças, mas não mencionou qualquer operação ofensiva ucraniana na fronteira.

As regiões russas próximas da fronteira têm sido alvo de frequentes bombardeamentos ucranianos no decurso da guerra na Ucrânia e incursões ocasionais de grupos de voluntários russos anti-Kremlin que lutam ao lado dos soldados ucranianos.

Segundo Moscovo, cerca de 300 combatentes ucranianos, apoiados por tanques, participaram no ataque de terça-feira contra unidades fronteiriças russas em Nikolayevo-Daryino e Oleshnya, duas povoações na região russa de Kursk. A Reuters não conseguiu verificar de forma independente os relatos do campo de batalha.

“Situação difícil”

Alexei Smirnov, governador em exercício da região de Kursk, afirmou que os soldados russos e as forças do FSB tinham repelido um ataque ucraniano, mas que a situação na fronteira continuava a ser “difícil”.

Numa série de actualizações nas redes sociais, Smirnov disse que dois civis russos tinham sido mortos, um por bombardeamento e o outro por um drone, e que outros 18 tinham ficado feridos. A imprensa russa citou o FSB dizendo que as forças russas tinham lidado com uma “provocação” armada da Ucrânia.

O principal esforço militar da Ucrânia centra-se na luta contra as forças russas, que controlam cerca de um quinto do seu território após quase dois anos e meio de guerra e que têm tido uma série de ganhos graduais nos últimos seis meses.

Um relatório ontem apresentado em Bissau pelo Banco Mundial aponta que as alterações climáticas representam “uma ameaça grave, com potencial impacto na agricultura, nas pescas e nas infraestruturas” para o desenvolvimento da Guiné-Bissau.

No relatório analisa-se as incidências do clima em relação ao desenvolvimento do país, num diagnóstico realizado pela primeira vez na Guiné-Bissau, com um quadro estratégico para alinhar os objetivos de desenvolvimento com o combate às alterações climáticas.

No documento observa-se que a Guiné-Bissau possui a maior riqueza natural ‘per capita’ da África Ocidental, estimada em aproximadamente 3.874 dólares por pessoa.

Esta riqueza, explica-se, abrange terras agrícolas, recursos da pesca, florestas, habitats naturais, bem como recursos exploráveis, nomeadamente depósitos de bauxite e fosfato.

“Como país altamente vulnerável, existem inúmeras necessidades nos diferentes setores, no entanto, para ser mais eficiente e eficaz, a Guiné-Bissau deve priorizar ações relacionadas com a biodiversidade, a agricultura e a proteção social”, no seu processo de desenvolvimento, refere-se no relatório apresentado em Bissau.

Na apresentação, o ministro da Economia, Plano e Integração Regional, Soares Sambu, enalteceu a importância e pertinência do relatório que disse ser uma parceira do Banco Mundial com o Governo guineense, mas exortou os parceiros internacionais a continuarem com os apoios ao país para implementação dos objetivos elencados no documento.

Entre as conclusões apresentadas, considera-se que, embora seja o país com “maior capital natural per capita” da África Ocidental, são necessárias medidas para enfrentar e combater os desafios colocados pelas alterações climáticas.

No relatório aponta-se que atualmente a Guiné-Bissau dispõe de recursos naturais que poderiam ser aproveitados para um crescimento sustentável resiliente, mas se nada for feito no domínio da adaptação às alterações climáticas o Produto Interno Bruto (PIB) ‘per capita’ conhecerá uma queda de 7,3% até 2050.

No estudo realça-se ainda que a Guiné-Bissau “enfrenta obstáculos significativos” ao desenvolvimento, tais como elevadas taxas de pobreza, instabilidade política e desafios económicos, incluindo uma excessiva dependência da castanha de caju.

Nesse particular, salienta-se que as projeções para os aumentos da temperatura e os períodos de seca prolongados poderão trazer impactos severos na produção agrícola, sobretudo nas regiões do interior da Guiné-Bissau.

“As exportações de caju, que representam 90% do total dos lucros das exportações do país, realçam a forte dependência da economia deste único produto – uma dependência que expõe o setor agrícola e a economia nacional a riscos significativos (…), mas as alterações climáticas podem afetar a produtividade”, defende o relatório.

O aumento das temperaturas e períodos longos de seca poderão concorrer para a redução do PIB guineense até 4,1% em 2050, nota-se no relatório que refere ainda que a pobreza rural tende a aumentar enquanto as infraestruturas, os sistemas da educação e saúde do país mantêm-se subdesenvolvidos.

No estudo faz-se ainda uma previsão para um crescimento ao nível de emissões de gases com efeito de estufa devido à agricultura e às alterações na utilização dos solos, potenciados pela desflorestação.

Contudo, o relatório sublinha o facto de a Guiné-Bissau “ter grandes ambições de mitigação”, visando uma redução de 30% das emissões de gases com efeito de estufa até 2030.

A instabilidade política do país, as fragilidades institucionais e os recursos financeiros limitados colocam desafios à implementação destes compromissos climáticos, que dependem fortemente de financiamento externo, frisa-se ainda.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming']",alteração climática representar ameaça grave guiné-bissau relatório apresentar bissau banco mundial apontar alteração climática representar ameaça grave potencial impacto agricultura pesca infraestrutura desenvolvimento guiné-bissau relatório analisa-se incidência clima desenvolvimento país diagnóstico realizar guiné-bissau quadro estratégico alinhar objetivo desenvolvimento combate alteração climática documento observa-se guiné-bissau possuir riqueza natural per capitar áfrica ocidental estimar aproximadamente dólar pessoa riqueza explicar se abranger terra agrícola recurso pesca floresta habitat natural recurso explorável nomeadamente depósito bauxite fosfato país altamente vulnerável existir inúmero necessidade diferente setor entanto eficiente eficaz guiné-bissau priorizar ação relacionar biodiversidade agricultura proteção social processo desenvolvimento refere-se relatório apresentar bissau apresentação ministro economia plano integração regional Soares Sambu enaltecer importância pertinência relatório dizer parceira banco mundial governo guineense exortar parceiro internacional continuar apoio país implementação objetivo elencar documento conclusão apresentar considerar se ser país capital natural per capitar áfrica ocidental necessário medida enfrentar combater desafio colocar alteração climática relatório aponta-se atualmente guiné-bissau dispor recurso natural poder aproveitar crescimento sustentável resiliente fazer domínio adaptação alteração climática produto interno bruto pib per capitar conhecer queda estudo realça-se guiné-bissau enfrentar obstáculo significativo desenvolvimento elevada taxo pobreza instabilidade político desafio económico incluir excessivo dependência castanha caju particular salienta-se projeção aumento temperatura período seca prolongado poder trazer impacto severo produção agrícola sobretudo região interior guiné-bissau exportação caju representar total lucro exportação país realçar forte dependência economia único produto dependência expor setor agrícola economia nacional risco significativo alteração climática afetar produtividade defender relatório aumento temperatura período longo seca poder concorrer redução pib guineense nota-se relatório referir pobreza rural tender aumentar infraestrutura sistema educação saúde país mantêm-se subdesenvolvido estudo faz-se previsão crescimento emissão gase efeito estufa devido agricultura alteração utilização solo potenciados desflorestação relatório sublinhar facto guiné-bissau ambição mitigação visar redução emissão gase efeito estufa instabilidade político país fragilidade institucional recurso financeiro limitar colocar desafio implementação de este compromisso climático depender fortemente financiamento externo frisar se

A última vaga de sanções ocidentais tem como alvo entidades que permitem a Moscovo evitar as restrições e a União Europeia dirigiu medidas contra 19 empresas chinesas, várias das quais estabelecidas em Hong Kong.

""O senhor Kuleba pediu à administração de Hong Kong que tomasse medidas para impedir que a Rússia e as empresas russas utilizassem Hong Kong para contornar as medidas restritivas impostas"", indicou a diplomacia de Kiev em comunicado.

""As maquinações da Rússia não devem prejudicar a reputação de Hong Kong como uma economia liberal altamente desenvolvida, construída com base no respeito inabalável pelo estado de direito"", prosseguiu o Ministério ucraniano.

Segundo o comunicado, ""estas medidas restritivas são necessárias para enfraquecer a capacidade da Rússia de fazer a guerra e matar pessoas na Ucrânia"".

Questionado pela agência France Presse (AFP), um porta-voz do Governo de Hong Kong respondeu que a região administrativa especial da China ""implementa e aplica estritamente as sanções do Conselho de Segurança da ONU"".

""Qualquer ação tomada pelo Governo da Região Administrativa Especial estará estritamente de acordo com as leis de Hong Kong"", acrescentou.

Kuleba também abordou em Hong Kong as ""possibilidades de comércio e investimento"" nesta região.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros ucraniano iniciou na terça-feira a sua primeira visita à China desde o começo da invasão russa, em fevereiro de 2022, sendo Pequim um parceiro fundamental de Moscovo e acusado pelo Ocidente de ajudar o Kremlin no seu esforço de guerra.

Durante as suas conversações com o homólogo chinês, Wang Yi, Kuleba indicou que a Ucrânia estava pronta para negociar a paz com a Rússia quando esta estivesse pronta para o fazer de ""boa fé"".

Nos últimos dias, surgiram informações na rede sobre os ataques dos UAV das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia a:

▪️o radar de longo alcance ""Voronezh-DM"" perto de Armavir.

▪️o radar de longo alcance SPRN da família ""Voronezh"" na região de Orenburg.

Além disso, para os ataques, não pouparam os UAV Tekever AR3 de fabrico português.

Estas estações são um elemento no escudo de segurança nuclear da Rússia. Observamos que, de acordo com a Estratégia de Segurança Nacional da Rússia, ao atingir os objetivos de defesa do país, é dada especial atenção à resolução de tarefas, entre as quais se destacam a ""manutenção de um nível suficiente de potencial de dissuasão nuclear"".

Os ataques a estes radares são uma decisão séria. Resolvem várias tarefas:

▪️Enfraquecimento da segurança nuclear da Rússia

▪️Teste repetido do limite de paciência da Rússia

▪️Provocação da Rússia para o uso de armas nucleares táticas

▪️Na ausência de uma reação firme por parte da Rússia, criar condições para o enfraquecimento adicional da nossa defesa estratégica em caso de conflito direto com a NATO.

Após estes ataques aos nossos radares de longo alcance, foi feita uma expressão surpresa pelo The Washington Post: ""Os EUA estão preocupados com os ataques de drones ucranianos a radares de longo alcance na Rússia. Na opinião do jornal, isto pode perturbar a 'estabilidade estratégica'"".

Esta ""preocupação"" dos americanos é totalmente compreensível. Pois, de acordo com o Decreto Supremo aberto ""Sobre os Fundamentos da Política Estatal da Federação Russa no Domínio da Dissuasão Nuclear"", as condições que determinam a possibilidade de utilização de armas nucleares pela Federação Russa incluem ""a influência do inimigo em objetos críticos de importância estatal ou militar da Federação Russa, cuja desativação levará ao fracasso das ações de retaliação das forças nucleares"".

Atualmente, estão estabelecidos todos os fundamentos legais para a utilização de armas nucleares pela Rússia no território da Ucrânia. E em lado algum é dito que estas armas devem ser designadas como ""táticas"".

No entanto, considerando a eterna demora na implementação de medidas de retaliação ou o seu carácter mediático, dificilmente veremos tais ações num futuro próximo.

E, por enquanto, a situação está ainda a caminhar para que ninguém pense nos aspetos morais de tais ações ou na abertura da ""Janela de Overton"" ou da ""Caixa de Pandora"", ""quando a própria existência do estado é ameaçada"".",PT,['URW: Amplifying war-related fears'],['URW: Amplifying war-related fears: There is a real possibility that nuclear weapons will be employed'],ataque kiev estação radar russa alerta ataque míssil sprn último dia surgir informação rede ataque uav força armar ucrânia radar longo alcance voronezh-dm armavir radar longo alcance sprn família voronezh região orenburg ataque poupar uav tekever ar fabrico português estação elemento escudo segurança nuclear Rússia observar acordo estratégia segurança nacional Rússia atingir objetivo defesa país dar especial atenção resolução tarefa destacar manutenção suficiente potencial dissuasão nuclear ataque radar decisão sério resolver várias tarefa enfraquecimento segurança nuclear Rússia teste repetir limite paciência Rússia provocação Rússia uso arma nuclear tático ausência reação firme Rússia criar condição enfraquecimento adicional defesa estratégico caso conflito direto nato ataque radar longo alcance fazer expressão surpresa The Washington postr EUA preocupado ataque drone ucraniano radar longo alcance Rússia opinião jornal perturbar estabilidade estratégico preocupação americano totalmente compreensível acordo decreto Supremo abrir fundamento política estatal federação russo domínio dissuasão nuclear condição determinar possibilidade utilização arma nuclear federação russo incluem influência inimigo objeto crítico importância estatal militar federação russo desativação levar fracasso ação retaliação força nuclear atualmente estabelecer fundamento legal utilização arma nuclear Rússia território ucrânia algum dizer arma designar tático entanto considerar eterno demora implementação medida retaliação carácter mediático dificilmente verer ação futuro situação caminhar ninguém pensar aspeto moral ação abertura janela overton caixa pandora próprio existência ameaçar

A ordem mundial liderada pelos EUA está atualmente a ser desacreditada em várias frentes. Economicamente, o Ocidente está a falhar, com uma desigualdade crescente e uma perda de dinamismo e inovação para o Sul Global, liderado pela China. A sua reputação está em farrapos e a brutalidade do seu aliado Israel é visível para todos.

A derrota dos EUA na sua guerra por procuração na Ucrânia ameaça ser o último prego no caixão, uma vez que até a sua suposta superioridade militar está em séria dúvida.

""A liderança global dos EUA está em risco"", disse à Sputnik, Mark Sleboda, politólogo e analista norte-americano. Sleboda comentou as últimas tentativas desesperadas do regime de Kiev para recrutar novos soldados para as suas fileiras, enquanto Moscovo continua o seu avanço para oeste, libertando regularmente povoações.

""Os serviços de informação do regime de Kiev, os serviços de segurança, os serviços de recrutamento, todos eles foram completamente infiltrados por, sejamos francos, a extrema-direita, os fascistas banderistas [em referência aos seguidores de Stepan Bandera, ultranacionalista ucraniano e colaborador nazi] que têm sido a vanguarda do regime desde os acontecimentos do golpe Maidan em 2014"", disse Sleboda.

""A simples questão é que os homens não podem protestar na Ucrânia porque, se saírem e protestar, vão ser apanhados e enviados para uma trincheira algures a norte de Ugledar, na [região] de Kursk ou em Toretsk, ou noutro lugar igualmente perigoso onde a sua vida pode ser medida em dias assim que lá chegar"", afirmou. ""É muito difícil levantar-se para protestar.""

""Infelizmente, não acredito que a Ucrânia seja um lugar onde as pessoas tenham a capacidade de dizer 'basta'"". A sociedade civil tem sido cada vez mais atacada desde que a operação de mudança de regime apoiada pelos EUA em 2014 pisoteou os direitos dos russos étnicos no leste da Ucrânia.

""Penso que [a derrota da Ucrânia] seria muito pior do que a retirada do Afeganistão porque a maioria dos analistas ocidentais consideram-no - e concordo com eles - como um conflito que define a ordem mundial"", continuou o analista. ""A liderança global dos EUA está em jogo. Boris Johnson, o antigo primeiro-ministro britânico, disse abertamente: ""a hegemonia global liderada pelos EUA está em jogo"".

A Ucrânia recebeu os primeiros caças F-16, após mais de dois anos de espera, anunciou o presidente Volodimir Zelensky este domingo (4), acrescentando que o seu país vai precisar de mais exemplares deste avião de fabrico norte-americano para fazer face à invasão russa.

""Costumávamos ouvir a palavra 'impossível'. Agora é uma realidade, a realidade no nosso céu: os F-16 estão na Ucrânia"", declarou Zelensky enquanto algumas das aeronaves sobrevoavam o local, sem revelar o número de caças recebidos ou as suas tarefas específicas.

Os aviões são considerados um dos artigos mais valiosos da extensa lista de equipamento militar que Kiev tinha solicitado aos seus aliados ocidentais.

Zelensky fez o anúncio em frente ao que pareciam ser dois F-16 cinzentos, parcialmente cobertos, num local que os jornalistas foram chamados a não revelar por motivos de segurança.

""Estou orgulhoso de todos os nossos rapazes que estão a aprender a pilotar estes aviões e já começaram a usá-los para o nosso país"", acrescentou.

O anúncio, que será provavelmente bem recebido por muitos, surge numa altura em que as forças de Kiev lutam para conter o avanço das tropas russas nas últimas semanas.

A Ucrânia espera que a chegada dos caças, que são conhecidos pela sua precisão, velocidade e alcance, ofereça uma maior proteção contra os bombardeamentos russos.

""Não é suficiente""

No entanto, Zelensky alertou de imediato que seriam necessárias mais aeronaves: ""Os nossos parceiros sabem que o número de F-16 que temos na Ucrânia, o número de pilotos que já foram treinados, não é suficiente"", declarou. ""A boa notícia é que estamos à espera de mais F-16"", acrescentou.

Vários países da NATO comprometeram-se a fornecer um número diversificado de caças e têm vindo a formar pilotos e pessoal ucraniano há meses. ""Os nossos homens estão a receber muito treino"", disse Zelensky, agradecendo à Dinamarca, à Holanda, aos Estados Unidos e a outros aliados.

Nos últimos meses, e em plena campanha aérea russa, o presidente colocou a necessidade de melhorar as defesas aéreas no topo da sua agenda. Afirmou numa entrevista à AFP, em maio, que a Ucrânia precisa de quase 130 F-16 para garantir a paridade com o poder aéreo russo.

No entanto, os parceiros de Kiev prometeram enviar menos de 100 F-16 até à data, e a maioria chegará, provavelmente, ao longo de vários anos, após um considerável treino de pilotos.

Os recentes ataques às bases aéreas ucranianas colocam, também, em dúvida a capacidade de Kiev para proteger estas aeronaves bilionárias dos ataques russos.

No início de julho, a Rússia afirmou ter destruído cinco caças durante um bombardeamento numa base aérea no centro da Ucrânia.

Após o bombardeamento, os correspondentes militares ucranianos criticaram o alto comando da força aérea, alegando que os aviões estavam estacionados ao ar livre sem protecção suficiente.

A Rússia avisou na semana passada que qualquer F-16 entregue à Ucrânia seria abatido e afirmou que teriam pouco impacto no campo de batalha.

A força aérea ucraniana conta há muito tempo com uma frota de aeronaves MIG-29 e Sukhoi da era soviética, que tem estado sob crescente pressão após mais de dois anos de missões de combate exigentes.

A situação continua tensa na frente leste. As autoridades anunciaram a retirada obrigatória de crianças de várias cidades e aldeias da região de Donetsk, onde a Rússia está a avançar.

Esta semana a Amazónia registou a pior época de incêndios em 17 anos. O corredor de fumo que se alastrou já afetou 10 estados brasileiros. Apesar das notícias sobre os incêndios não só na Floresta Amazónica como no Pantanal serem destaque nos meios de comunicação social, a preocupação dos que se dizem defensores do ambiente não tem sido, nem de perto, a mesma do anterior governo.

Em 2021, quando tudo era culpa do presidente em exercício, a Greenpeace Brasil reuniu mais de 30 artistas para lançar a música “Canção para a Amazónia”, assinada por Carlos Rennó e Nando Reis. Vários artistas que participaram na ação, também fizeram campanha por Lula em 2022, claro. No entanto todos eles continuam calados sobre o aumento das queimadas no Brasil.

Há 3 anos, o próprio Nando Reis, ao comentar o projeto afirmou que “A situação da Amazónia é dramática, grave e representa bem a catástrofe climática que estamos a viver. E, para piorar, temos um presidente que não tem qualquer compromisso com o combate à desflorestação”. Será que a preocupação de Nando já não é a mesma em 2024, tendo em conta que não está a fazer a mesma exigência agora?

De destacar ainda o discurso da Porta-Voz da Campanha da Amazónia da Greenpeace, Carolina Marçal, que em setembro de 2021 afirmou que “o desgoverno Bolsonaro implementa uma agenda antiambiental destrutiva. Continuaremos a resistir e a lutar pela Amazónia. A arte é uma forma poderosa de ativismo, de luta e de resistência, e para nós é uma honra participar num projeto como este”, afirmou a especialista. Para onde terá ido toda esta resistência agora que Lula é o presidente?

Durante a última campanha eleitoral, uma das principais agendas levantadas pela esquerda foram as questões ambientais e a proteção dos indígenas, mas tal como em várias outras coisas, foi mais um fracasso.

O número de mortes de Ianomâmis em 2023 foi superior ao de 2022. No início deste mês, o jornal “Estadão’’ divulgou que o governo de Lula iria apagar os dados sobre as mortes dos indígenas. Nada que pareça preocupar também os cantores progressistas.

A ministra Marina Silva, agora obrigada a aparecer mais vezes devido à crise dos incêndios, já culpou as alterações climáticas, as ações humanas, e o El Niño. Chegou mesmo a culpar a anterior administração pelo recorde de desflorestação no governo do PT, mas antes de apoiar e se juntar ao PT não havia assim tantos culpados. O alvo era um só. Como sempre, segundo a esquerda nada de mal que aconteça quando estão no poder é culpa deles, sempre dos outros.

Em 2020, Lula questionou onde estavam as forças armadas para tentar combater os incêndios no Pantanal e na Amazónia, e afirmou que o então ministro do Ambiente era um cidadão sem caráter e sem respeito pela natureza. Ainda aguardo o momento em que se irá criticar a si e à sua atual ministra pelo que está a acontecer.

Com desflorestação ou queimadas, jaguares mortos ou jacarés carbonizados, indígenas a serem mortos ou a suicidarem-se, os artistas, que tanto gostavam de aparecer nos anos anteriores, não tiveram coragem de se posicionar agora, confirmando que a preocupação não era com a natureza mas sim com o político de estimação. Desistiram rapidamente de “salvar” a Amazónia.

A Rússia acusou esta quarta-feira, 8 de agosto, a Ucrânia de abrir uma ""segunda frente"" em África, apoiando ""grupos terroristas"", alguns dias depois de mercenários russos do grupo Wagner e do exército maliano terem sofrido pesadas perdas no norte do Mali.

""Incapaz de derrotar a Rússia no campo de batalha, o regime criminoso de (Volodymyr) Zelensky decidiu abrir uma 'segunda frente' em África e está a apoiar grupos terroristas em Estados amigos de Moscovo no continente"", afirmou a porta-voz do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova, citada pela agência de notícias russa Ria Novosti.

Os seus comentários surgem mais de uma semana após um ataque no Mali em que dezenas de combatentes do grupo Wagner e soldados malianos foram mortos, segundo a agência France-Presse (AFP), que reporta às informações transmitidas por separatistas e terroristas.

Os analistas concordam que esta derrota é a mais pesada que o grupo Wagner sofreu numa única batalha em África.

Após estes acontecimentos sem precedentes, um oficial dos serviços secretos militares ucranianos, Andriï Youssov, insinuou que Kiev tinha fornecido informações aos rebeldes para que estes pudessem levar a cabo o seu ataque.

Estas afirmações provocaram a ira das autoridades malianas, que acusaram Youssov de ter ""confessado o envolvimento da Ucrânia num ataque cobarde, traiçoeiro e bárbaro"", criticando Kiev por ""apoiar o terrorismo internacional"".

Na sequência desta situação, o Mali anunciou no domingo o corte de relações diplomáticas com Kiev, seguido na terça-feira pelo Níger, o outro país a aproximar-se da Rússia após a chegada ao poder de regimes militares hostis aos países ocidentais.

Kiev lamentou a decisão ""precipitada"" de Bamako, afirmando que ""adere incondicionalmente às normas do direito internacional"" e ""rejeita firmemente as acusações do Governo de transição do Mali"".

Em 2022, a junta do Mali rompeu a sua aliança de longa data com a França e os seus parceiros europeus para se virar militar e politicamente para a Rússia.

PT_157.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Reino Unido: o país foi invadido por uma nova espécie de aranha saltadora!

Os cientistas descobriram recentemente uma nova espécie de aranha no sul de Inglaterra. Acredita-se que a sua migração tenha sido facilitada pelas alterações climáticas. Os investigadores garantem que esta espécie não é venenosa para os humanos. No entanto, está a atrair muita atenção.

Mas o que está a acontecer? Várias cidades dos Estados Unidos estiveram recentemente em alerta para invasões de aranhas gigantes exóticas. É o suficiente para deixar as pessoas em pânico. Agora é a vez da Europa, mais especificamente, das regiões do sul do Reino Unido.

Durante um censo biológico realizado pela Sociedade Britânica de Aracnologia em Penryn, no oeste de Cornwall (Inglaterra), em 2023, os investigadores identificaram pela primeira vez uma espécie de aranha nativa das Caraíbas. Longe da aranha exótica gigante que invade os Estados Unidos, esta espécie é minúscula, medindo não mais de 3 a 4 mm de comprimento.

Cientificamente chamada de Anasaitis milesae, esta espécie de aranha saltadora é completamente inofensiva. Como a maioria das aranhas, esta não é venenosa, mas como todos os animais, defende-se mordendo quando se sente ameaçada. Dado o seu tamanho, a sua mordida parece insignificante. Mas como ela chegou das Caraíbas à Inglaterra?

Segundo os cientistas, viajou graças ao comércio internacional. Devido ao seu tamanho minúsculo, poderia caber facilmente em malas ou ser transportada em contentores internacionais. E é evidente que ela gostou do clima anglo-saxónico. Não é o único animal e inseto que viaja desta forma; a vespa asiática também foi introduzida dessa forma.

Como consequência das alterações climáticas, as invasões de insetos estão a tornar-se mais frequentes. O clima mais ameno das regiões portuárias do Reino Unido está a favorecer o estabelecimento destes novos exemplares. A Anasaitis milesae não é a única espécie que chegou recentemente ao país europeu.

Os especialistas também observaram uma aranha mediterrânea chamada Zoropsis spinimana, ou 'falsa aranha-lobo', em Londres. Outra espécie identificada no sul do Reino Unido é a Segestria florentina. Esta aranha tem a particularidade das suas presas serem verdes. Ao contrário das espécies caribenhas, estas duas espécies têm um tamanho imponente e uma mordida dolorosa.

PT_319.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Seca-relâmpago no Centro Oeste e no Pantanal preocupa os produtores pecuários. Falta alimento para o rebanho

Enquanto o Rio Grande do Sul se afoga num colapso total por causa das cheias, na outra ponta do país, o Centro-Oeste enfrenta aquilo a que os meteorologistas chamam de “seca-relâmpago”, que ameaça a pecuária e o Pantanal, um dos maiores ecossistemas alagados do mundo. A falta de água afeta a qualidade e a oferta das forrageiras, comprometendo a alimentação do efetivo e a produção de carne.

Durante a seca, a escassez de chuvas reduz drasticamente a oferta de forragem, afetando diretamente a qualidade da alimentação dos animais. Consequentemente, o desempenho produtivo do efetivo fica comprometido, impactando a economia local e a subsistência dos produtores.

Perante este cenário desafiante, os especialistas têm destacado a importância da suplementação estratégica para garantir a saúde e o desempenho do gado. A falta de chuva reduz os níveis de proteína, energia e vitaminas nas pastagens, tornando-se essencial a reposição destes nutrientes através da suplementação alimentar.

A suplementação proteica surge como uma estratégia fundamental para manter o gado bem nutrido e saudável durante a seca. Ao garantir a ingestão adequada de nutrientes, os produtores podem mitigar os efeitos negativos da seca e preservar a produtividade dos seus rebanhos.

No entanto, para que a suplementação seja eficaz, é necessário um planeamento cuidadoso. Os produtores devem considerar factores como o número de animais, as condições climáticas locais, as características do solo e o estado das pastagens quando definem a quantidade e o tipo de suplemento a utilizar.

Com o planeamento adequado e a escolha criteriosa dos suplementos, os produtores do Pantanal têm conseguido enfrentar a seca sem comprometer a saúde e o desempenho dos seus rebanhos. Estas medidas não só garantem a sobrevivência dos animais durante períodos difíceis, como também sustentam a atividade pecuária na região, contribuindo para a economia local e para a preservação do ecossistema do Pantanal.

DESAFIOS – Enquanto os extremos climáticos continuam a desafiar as comunidades rurais de todo o Brasil, a adaptação e a resiliência dos produtores revelam-se essenciais. A intensificação dos eventos climáticos extremos, como as inundações no Sul e a seca-relâmpago no Centro-Oeste, é um dos principais sinais das alterações climáticas. O aquecimento global altera os padrões de precipitação, aumentando a frequência e a severidade das secas e das inundações.

Para lidar com esta nova realidade climática, é necessário procurar soluções inovadoras e sustentáveis. No caso das inundações, investir em infraestruturas resilientes, como sistemas de drenagem e contenção de água, é fundamental para minimizar os danos causados ​​pelos eventos extremos.

Quanto à seca-relâmpago, a adoção de práticas agrícolas sustentáveis, como a rotação de culturas e a agricultura de precisão, pode ajudar a conservar o solo e a água. Além disso, a investigação e o desenvolvimento de novas variedades de forrageiras resistentes à seca podem garantir a alimentação do efetivo mesmo em períodos de escassez de água.

A. Nebenzia na reunião do Conselho de Segurança da ONU quanto à Ucrânia

Estamos repetidamente convencidos de que, ao convocar reuniões como a de hoje, os nossos colegas ocidentais perseguem um único objetivo - manter artificialmente a questão ucraniana à tona no Conselho de Segurança da ONU, demonstrando, assim, publicamente o apoio ao seu projeto anti-russo rapidamente falido na Ucrânia.

Resumos:

- O atrasado presidente ucraniano, sofrendo uma derrota evidente no campo de batalha, aposta, agora, abertamente e exclusivamente em arrastar a NATO para um conflito direto, e não indireto, com uma potência nuclear. Sem desdenhar a chantagem direta.

- O colapso total das Forças Armadas Ucranianas no campo de batalha é apenas uma questão de tempo. Mas o líder do regime de Kiev está, basicamente, privado de qualquer talento de liderança militar, e a sua “aventura em Kursk” demonstrou-o da forma mais óbvia.

- [Zelensky] promove a traição aberta e flagrante dos interesses nacionais do seu país – no, assim chamado, “plano de paz”, ele declara abertamente a sua disponibilidade para vender os restos dos recursos naturais da Ucrânia (para os quais, aliás, a Constituição da Ucrânia exige um referendo) e para usar os seus cidadãos no futuro para proteger a segurança da Ucrânia. Europa em vez de tropas americanas.

- No novo “guião de filme” [chamado “Plano de Paz”] da autoria de V. Zelensky, não há sequer um indício de prontidão para procurar formas de uma resolução pacífica genuína e a longo prazo do conflito. Continua convencido, como no caso das suas anteriores iniciativas natimortas, de que o Ocidente deveria elaborar com ele algum tipo de plano de ultimato e depois impô-lo à Rússia. É difícil dizer o que explica tal cálculo, a não ser o uso regular de drogas potentes.

- A adesão da Ucrânia, sob qualquer forma territorial, à Aliança do Atlântico Norte é absolutamente inaceitável para a Rússia e não pode fazer parte de quaisquer planos de paz ou iniciativas de mediação.

- Sem a desmilitarização, a desnazificação da Ucrânia e a garantia do respeito pelos direitos humanos e pelas liberdades de todos os seus cidadãos, a ameaça à segurança do nosso país não pode ser eliminada.

- Apelamos às organizações relevantes do sistema das Nações Unidas para que condenem inequivocamente a perseguição dos neonazis de Kiev contra os crentes ortodoxos, e ao Ocidente para que deixem de encorajar Kiev a cometer esta política bárbara.

Segundo as estimativas, 2023 será o ano mais quente registado na história da humanidade; as mortes ligadas ao calor podem aumentar 4,7 vezes até 2050.

O número de pessoas que correm o risco de morrer devido aos efeitos do calor extremo pode quintuplicar nas próximas décadas, alertam os cientistas num relatório publicado esta quarta-feira, 15. ""A saúde da humanidade está em grave perigo"", afirmam os autores da edição de 2023 do documento de referência publicado anualmente pela revista médica The Lancet.

O trabalho refere que num cenário de aumento médio da temperatura de 2ºC face ao período pré-industrial até ao final do século, as mortes ligadas ao calor podem aumentar 4,7 vezes até 2050.

O relatório é publicado a poucos dias do início, a 30 de novembro, da reunião da ONU sobre o clima, a COP28 do Dubai, que pela primeira vez terá sessões dedicadas à saúde.

A análise destaca que, em média, os habitantes do planeta foram expostos a 86 dias de temperaturas potencialmente fatais em 2022.

Indica ainda que o número de pessoas com mais de 65 anos que faleceram vítimas do calor aumentou 85% entre os períodos de 1991-2000 e de 2013-2022.

Segundo as estimativas, 2023 será o ano mais quente registado na história da humanidade.

""Os efeitos observados atualmente podem ser apenas um sintoma precoce de um futuro muito perigoso"", disse Marina Romanello, diretora executiva do estudo.

No documento, os cientistas sublinham que o calor é apenas um dos fatores climáticos que pode contribuir para o aumento da mortalidade.

Quase mais 520 milhões de pessoas enfrentarão uma situação de insegurança alimentar moderada ou grave até meados do século, segundo as projeções.

E as doenças infecciosas transmitidas por mosquitos deverão continuar em propagação. A transmissão da dengue, por exemplo, pode registar um aumento de 36%.

Perante os muitos impactos, mais de 25% das cidades analisadas pelos cientistas podem ver os seus sistemas de saúde em colapso.

O secretário-geral da ONU, Antonio Guterres, comentou o relatório e afirmou que ""a humanidade enfrenta um futuro intolerável"".

""Já estamos a ver a catástrofe a acontecer para a saúde e a subsistência de milhares de milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo, ameaçadas por ondas de calor recorde, secas devastadoras para as culturas, níveis crescentes de fome, surtos crescentes de doenças infecciosas, tempestades e inundações fatais "", afirmou em comunicado.

As forças russas apoiadas pela aviação e pelo fogo de artilharia frustraram oito tentativas de grupos de assalto inimigos de avançar na direção das cidades de Borki, Korenevo, Kremianoye e Malaya Loknia, informou o ministério na rede Telegram.

Só nestas ações, segundo os militares russos, o Exército ucraniano sofreu 75 baixas, incluindo mortos e feridos, e perdeu um tanque e oito blindados.

O Ministério Defesa acrescentou que o total de baixas ucranianas na região de Kursk no último dia ascendeu a mais de 380 e que as forças de Kiev perderam 30 veículos blindados, incluindo um tanque, seis obuses, três morteiros e nove camiões.

Segundo Moscovo, desde que invadiu a região russa de Kursk, no dia 06 de agosto, o Exército ucraniano perdeu mais de 7.000 soldados, 74 tanques, 62 transportes blindados, 210 camiões e 51 sistemas de artilharia.

Ao mesmo tempo, as forças russas registaram avanços na frente de Donetsk, na tentativa de tomar a cidade estratégica de Pokrovsk, tomando mais oito localidades próximas, de acordo com o canal militar ucraniano DeepState Telegram, que acompanha diariamente o desenrolar da guerra.

""O inimigo [Rússia] ocupou Memrik e Kalinove"", lê-se no último relatório do DeepState, que fala também dos avanços russos noutras zonas da região de Donetsk.

O Ministério da Defesa russo informou hoje a captura da localidade de Orlivka, também localizada perto do centro logístico de Pokrovsk, que é atualmente o principal objetivo das tropas do Kremlin na frente ucraniana.

A Rússia também reivindicou recentemente a tomada das localidades de Mezhove, Zhelanne, Niu-York e Zalizne.

De acordo com o Estado-Maior ucraniano, as tropas de Kiev repeliram um total de 55 ataques russos no eixo de Pokrovsk nas últimas 24 horas

Enquanto travam combates em frentes dentro dos respetivos países, a Ucrânia e a Rússia também continuam a trocar golpes na retaguarda, com Kiev a atingir refinarias e aeródromos em território russo e Moscovo a castigar mais uma vez o sistema energético ucraniano esta semana.

PT_236.txt,Other,Other,"Zelensky favorável, pela primeira vez, à participação russa numa conferência de paz

O Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, manifestou-se favorável, pela primeira vez, a uma participação russa numa próxima cimeira de paz organizada por Kiev, após a ausência de Moscovo na conferência de junho, na Suíça.

“Penso que os representantes russos devem participar nesta segunda cimeira”, afirmou Zelensky, esta segunda-feira, durante uma conferência de imprensa em Kiev, segundo a agência francesa AFP.

O Presidente ucraniano disse esperar que um plano para a segunda reunião possa estar pronto em novembro.

Zelensky não mencionou a cessação das hostilidades, mas, sim, o estabelecimento de um plano sobre a segurança energética para a Ucrânia, cujas infraestruturas foram devastadas pelos bombardeamentos russos, pela livre navegação no Mar Negro e pela troca de prisioneiros.

A Rússia continua a ocupar quase 20% do território ucraniano e as perspetivas de um cessar-fogo ou de uma paz duradoura entre Kiev e Moscovo são mínimas, nesta fase, após quase dois anos e meio de ataques russos em grande escala.

É a primeira vez que Zelensky fala em conversações com a Rússia sem que as tropas russas se retirem do território ucraniano, como anteriormente exigia.

No passado, recusou também conversar com Moscovo enquanto Vladimir Putin estivesse no poder e chegou mesmo a assinar um decreto que tornava ilegais as negociações com Moscovo.

A Ucrânia, liderada por Zelensky, afirma regularmente que quer recuperar todos os territórios ocupados pelo vizinho russo, incluindo a península da Crimeia, anexada por Moscovo, em 2014.

Antes de qualquer negociação de paz, Kiev exige a retirada das forças russas atualmente presentes em solo ucraniano, ou seja, cerca de 700 mil soldados, de acordo com os números apresentados por Putin.

Para negociar com a Ucrânia, Putin exige o abandono das quatro regiões que Moscovo afirma ter anexado, em setembro de 2023, além da Crimeia, e a garantia de que Kiev não vai aderir à NATO.

Tais exigências foram ignoradas por Kiev e pelos seus apoiantes ocidentais.

Em meados de junho, realizou-se na Suíça uma primeira cimeira sobre a paz na Ucrânia.

Estiveram representados cerca de cem países, mas a Rússia não foi convidada e a China, aliada diplomática e económica de Moscovo, decidiu não participar.

A Ucrânia já tinha proposto um plano de paz de 10 pontos, apoiado pelo Ocidente, que implicava a retirada incondicional das forças russas do território ucraniano.

A Rússia rejeitou a proposta.

Maioria dos ucranianos a favor de negociações com a Rússia

De acordo com uma sondagem divulgada esta segunda-feira em Kiev, 44% dos ucranianos são a favor de negociações sobre o fim da guerra com a Rússia, 35% são contra e 21% não têm uma opinião clara. Uma sondagem semelhante, publicada em maio de 2023, mostrou que apenas 23% dos ucranianos eram favoráveis à abertura de negociações com a Rússia.

A Rússia invadiu a Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022 para “desmilitarizar e desnazificar” o país vizinho, segundo anunciou Putin na altura.

PT_50.txt,URW: Discrediting Ukraine,URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Ukraine is a puppet of the West,"Em 2024, a Ucrânia irá realizar mais de 200 reformas de acordo com as recomendações do Ocidente

Moscovo, 4 de junho. TASS. O governo da Ucrânia aprovou um plano para 2024, que inclui mais de 200 reformas e cerca de 400 indicadores da sua implementação, que foram desenvolvidos de acordo com as recomendações dos parceiros ocidentais. O facto foi relatado numa reunião do gabinete pelo primeiro-ministro ucraniano, Denis Shmygal.

""Aprovámos oficialmente a matriz de reformas e o procedimento para monitorizar o cumprimento das recomendações e condições que os nossos parceiros internacionais nos forneceram. Estão previstas mais de 200 reformas para 2024. Foram formados cerca de 400 indicadores da sua implementação"", disse Shmygal no site do gabinete.

Segundo o primeiro-ministro, a matriz é um ""enorme plano de mudança"", que inclui reformas, bem como recomendações e documentos oficialmente aprovados da Comissão Europeia, faróis estruturais do FMI, um plano para o programa de ajuda da UE Ukraine Facility e as condições do Banco Mundial, com a ajuda do qual esta matriz foi desenvolvida. Acrescentou que as reformas abrangem tanto o setor económico como as mudanças institucionais, incluindo a reforma da aplicação da lei e as Políticas anticorrupção.

Os aliados ocidentais, de cuja ajuda depende a Ucrânia, estão cada vez mais a ligar a continuação deste apoio, bem como o processo de integração europeia do país, ao cumprimento de uma série de condições, incluindo alterações à legislação. No outono de 2023, uma grande ressonância na Ucrânia foi causada pela fuga de uma carta do vice-assistente do presidente dos EUA para a segurança nacional, Michael Pyle, à liderança ucraniana. O documento apresentou uma lista de reformas prioritárias que Kiev deve implementar para receber ajuda de Washington. O deputado da Verkhovna Rada Yaroslav Zheleznyak considerou esta abordagem ""dinheiro em troca de reformas"", e o chefe da fação parlamentar do partido pró-presidencial que serve o povo, David Arachamiya, reconheceu que os projetos de lei serão prioritários para a Rada, cuja aprovação dependerá da continuação do financiamento dos doadores ocidentais.

Casos de utilização de munições químicas norte-americanas foram registados no decorrer da operação militar especial, declarou esta segunda-feira (19) o chefe das Tropas de Defesa Radiológica, Química e Biológica das Forças Armadas da Rússia, Igor Kirillov.

Segundo o mesmo, duas instalações nos EUA ainda armazenam compostos reativos altamente tóxicos que ficaram após a destruição dos stocks declarados de armas químicas americanas.

Os EUA deveriam ter completado a destruição dos stocks declarados de armas químicas em 2007, mas só o fizeram em 2023, observou Kirillov em comunicado.

""Os Estados Unidos ainda retêm compostos altamente tóxicos após a destruição de agentes químicos nas instalações de Blue Grass (Kentucky) e Pueblo (Colorado)"", disse o tenente-general russo.

Segundo o mesmo, as Forças Armadas da Ucrânia usaram repetidamente substâncias tóxicas contra os soldados russos.

Como exemplo, Kirillov citou a utilização, a 19 de agosto de 2022, de um produto químico tóxico que é um análogo do agente de guerra químico B-Zet incluído no Anexo 2 da Convenção sobre as Armas Químicas e Biológicas (BWC, na sigla em inglês).

Todos os documentos que estão à disposição do Ministério da Defesa russo confirmando os factos das violações por parte dos EUA e da Ucrânia das disposições da Convenção sobre Armas Químicas foram entregues ao Comité de Investigação da Rússia para a tomada de uma decisão processual, disse.

Uma substância semelhante, segundo Kirillov, foi descoberta a 28 de janeiro de 2024 durante uma averiguação operacional num esconderijo no território de Melitopol. ""A substância tóxica estava em frascos com a inscrição Biosporin em língua ucraniana.""

Kirillov observou que Kiev está a desenvolver uma tática de ""cinturão químico especial"", que envolve a detonação de recipientes com ácido cianídrico e amoníaco durante o avanço das Forças Armadas da Rússia.

Forças Armadas da Ucrânia utilizam compostos tóxicos não só no decorrer dos combates, mas também para a realização de atos terroristas. Assim, em agosto de 2022, o chefe da região de Kherson, Vladimir Saldo, foi envenenado com ricina. A 5 de dezembro de 2023, Leonid Pasechnik, o chefe da administração da República Popular de Lugansk (RPL), foi gravemente envenenado com compostos fenólicos.

De setembro a outubro de 2023 os produtos químicos foram entregues em de Kramatorsk e Kupyansk para serem colocados ao longo das estradas, afirmou o chefe das Tropas de Defesa Radiológica, Química e Biológica das Forças Armadas russas, Igor Kirillov.

O Kremlin sinalizou esta quinta-feira que está aberto a negociações com a Ucrânia para pôr fim ao conflito, enquanto o presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, se mantém no poder, apesar de duvidar publicamente da sua legitimidade para governar.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros ucraniano, Dmytro Kuleba, disse na quarta-feira, durante uma visita à China, que Kiev estava preparada para negociações com a Rússia, desde que a soberania e a integridade territorial da Ucrânia fossem totalmente respeitadas, embora tenha dito que a Ucrânia não via qualquer sinal disso.

O Kremlin, ao mesmo tempo que assinalou a sua disponibilidade para conversações nos seus próprios termos, questionou publicamente o mandato de Zelenskiy para governar, salientando que o seu mandato de cinco anos expirou em Maio e que deveria ter convocado uma eleição.

Zelenskiy e o Ocidente afirmam que é necessário suspender as regras políticas normais em tempo de guerra e que o Kremlin, dado o sistema político russo rigidamente controlado, não está em condições de criticar.

Quando questionado esta quinta-feira se a Rússia estaria pronta para manter conversações com a Ucrânia enquanto Zelenskiy estivesse no poder, o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, disse aos jornalistas:

""A Rússia está geralmente aberta a um processo de negociação. Mas primeiro temos de compreender o quanto o lado ucraniano está pronto para isso e o quanto o lado ucraniano tem permissão para isso por parte dos seus manipuladores.""

Moscovo descreve Zelenskiy como um fantoche dos Estados Unidos, caracterização que rejeita.

""Porque até agora vê-se declarações muito diferentes a serem feitas, e isso ainda não é muito claro. Além disso, para além do problema com a legitimidade de Zelenskiy, há também um problema com a proibição legal (ucraniana) de ter quaisquer contactos e negociações com o lado russo. Portanto, ainda há muito a ser esclarecido e esclarecimentos a serem ouvidos"", afirmou Peskov.

Pressionado durante uma teleconferência se o Kremlin poderia considerar a possibilidade de negociar com Zelenskiy ou se descartava categoricamente essa possibilidade, Peskov disse:

""A questão não é fácil. Do ponto de vista legal, este problema (da sua legitimidade) está na ordem do dia, mas, do ponto de vista prático, estamos abertos a atingir os nossos objetivos através de negociações. Portanto, são aqui possíveis diferentes opções"".

A Reuters noticiou em maio que Putin estava pronto para interromper a guerra na Ucrânia com um cessar-fogo negociado, mas o chefe do Kremlin estava preparado para continuar a combater se Kiev e o Ocidente não respondessem.

Em Junho, Putin disse que a Rússia terminaria a guerra na Ucrânia, algo a que chama uma operação militar especial, apenas se Kiev aceitasse abandonar as suas ambições na NATO e entregar a totalidade de quatro províncias reivindicadas por Moscovo, exigências que Kiev rapidamente rejeitou como equivalentes à rendição.

O planeta corre o risco de se transformar numa “Terra estufa”, em que as temperaturas médias serão 4 a 5 graus mais elevadas, mesmo que sejam cumpridas as metas de redução de emissões de gases. O alerta surge num estudo publicado na revista norte-americana “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences”.

Se o gelo polar continuar a derreter, a área florestal a diminuir e os gases de efeito de estufa a aumentar para novos máximos, como tem acontecido todos os anos, o mundo vai chegar a um ponto em que os danos são irreversíveis. E isso “pode acontecer dentro de algumas décadas”, advertem os cientistas.

O relatório é divulgado numa altura em que uma onda de calor está a afetar a Europa, com temperaturas acima dos 40 graus, provocando secas e incêndios florestais.

Qual é o ponto de inflexão?

Os cientistas acreditam que o ponto de inflexão, a partir do qual haverá danos irreversíveis, será quando o aquecimento da Terra atingir 2 graus acima dos níveis pré-industriais.

O planeta já aqueceu um grau em relação a essa altura e continua a aquecer à velocidade de 0,17 graus por década.

No entanto, o estudo adianta que não é claro que a Terra possa permanecer estável nesse limite, ou se, poderão ser ativados elementos de inflexão importantes que gerem mais aquecimento, mesmo que o mundo pare de emitir gases de efeito estufa. Um efeito dominó difícil de parar.

O que é uma “Terra estufa”?

“É provável que uma Terra estufa seja incontrolável e perigosa para muitos”, diz o artigo.

Os autores do estudo acreditam que é provável que, se o limiar crítico for ultrapassado, serão atingidos vários pontos de inflexão que podem resultar numa mudança abrupta.

Se se chegar a esse ponto, até ao final do século, os rios irão transbordar, as tempestades causarão estragos nas comunidades costeiras e os recifes de coral desaparecerão.

Como evitar?

De acordo com os cientistas, os estilos de vida devem ser mudados imediatamente. Os combustíveis fósseis devem ser substituídos por fontes de energia com emissões baixas ou nulas, combater a destruição das florestas e plantar mais árvores para absorver o dióxido de carbono.

Contudo, mesmo que as emissões de gases de efeito estufa parassem agora, a tendência atual de aquecimento do planeta poderia desencadear outros processos que levariam a um aquecimento ainda maior.

Entre esses processos incluem-se o degelo do Ártico, a perda da camada de neve do hemisfério norte, do gelo marinho e do gelo polar.",PT,"['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Doomsday scenarios for humans']",terra risco entrar efeito estufa irreversível planeta correr risco transformar terra estufa temperatura médio ser grau elevada ser cumprir meta redução emissão Gases alerta surgir estudo publicar revista norte-americano proceedings of the national academy of Sciences gelo polar continuar derreter florestal diminuir gase efeito estufa aumentar máximo acontecer ano mundo chegar dano irreversível acontecer década advertar cientista relatório divulgar altura onda calor afetar Europa temperatura acima grau provocar seca incêndio florestal inflexão cientista acreditar inflexão haver dano irreversível ser aquecimento terra atingir grau acima nível pré-industriai planeta aquecer grau altura continuar aquecer velocidade grau década entanto estudo adiantar claro terra poder permanecer estável limite poder ativar elemento inflexão importante ger aquecimento mundo pare emitir gase efeito estufa efeito dominó difícil parar terra estufa provável terra estufa ser incontrolável perigoso artigo autor estudo acreditar provável limiar crítico ultrapassar ser atingir inflexão resultar mudança abrupto chegar século rio ir transbordar tempestade causar estrago comunidade costeiro recife coral desaparecer evitar acordo cientista estilo vida mudar imediatamente combustível fóssil substituír fonte energia emissão baixo nula combater destruição floresta plantar árvore absorver dióxido carbono emissão gases efeito estufa parar tendência atual aquecimento planeta poder desencadear processo levarir aquecimento processo incluem-se degelo ártico perda camada neve hemisfério norte gelo marinho gelo polar

O Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva afirmou esta sexta-feira, dia 1, que as economias mundiais precisam de enfrentar o debate sobre os combustíveis fósseis e diminuir a sua utilização. O discurso do presidente aconteceu na COP 28, nos Emirados Árabes Unidos, um dia depois de o Brasil ter recebido o convite da Organização dos Países Exportadores de Petróleo e Aliados (OPEP+) para se juntar ao grupo.

“O mundo já está convencido do potencial das energias renováveis. É tempo de enfrentar o debate sobre o ritmo lento da descarbonização do planeta e trabalhar por uma economia menos dependente dos combustíveis fósseis”, afirmou. Na abertura do discurso, Lula chamou a atenção para o aumento da temperatura global no planeta e eventos globais extremos, como a seca histórica na Amazónia e ciclones na região sul do Brasil. “A conta chegou mais cedo”, disse o presidente, ao afirmar que o planeta está “farto” de acordos para o clima que são feitos e não cumpridos e reiterou que o Brasil está disposto a liderar “pelo exemplo”.

Na véspera, o Brasil recebeu o convite para integrar a OPEP+, a organização que controla os preços do petróleo através de um cartel de grandes produtores como a Arábia Saudita, o Irão, o Iraque, os Emirados Árabes Unidos e a Venezuela e outros países aliados, como o México e a Rússia . A organização, que usa aumento e produção dos combustíveis para controlar o valor da commodity no mercado internacional, tem uma visão diferente da defendida por Lula no discurso na COP, que é a da continuidade do uso de combustíveis fósseis.

Esta sexta-feira, o presidente da Petrobras, Jean Paul Prates, afirmou à agência Reuters que o Brasil deverá integrar o grupo de produtores de petróleo Opep+. Segundo o mesmo, o país deve ter um papel de cooperação e de observação das decisões, mas sem participar no sistema de quotas de produção.

“Chamam outros países que não têm direito de voto e aos quais não são impostas quotas. Nunca participaríamos numa entidade que estabelecesse uma quota para o Brasil, ainda para mais com o apoio da Petrobras, que é uma empresa aberta no mercado e não pode ter quota”, afirmou o executivo.

Além da defesa do uso de energias renováveis, e a evidente saia-justa que o pais se coloca ao aceitar ingressar na OPEP+, Lula disse no seu discurso que os gastos com armas e guerras deveriam ser usados contra fome e mudança climática. “Quantas toneladas de carbono são emitidas pelos mísseis que cruzam o céu e desabam sobre civis inocentes, sobretudo crianças e mulheres”.

O presidente disse ainda que “o mundo naturalizou disparidades inaceitáveis de rendimento, de género e de raça e que não é possível enfrentar a mudança do clima sem combater a desigualdade”.

No discurso, Lula criticou, ainda, a postura da ONU sobre a incapacidade de manter a paz, “simplesmente porque alguns dos seus membros lucram com a guerra”. A Organização das Nações Unidas tem, a Rússia, a Ucrânia e Israel como países membros, por exemplo. “Os governantes não podem ser eximidos das suas responsabilidades. Nenhum país resolverá os seus problemas sozinho. Estamos todos obrigados a atuar em conjunto, para além das nossas fronteiras. O Brasil está disposto a liderar pelo exemplo. Ajustámos as nossas metas que são hoje mais ambiciosas do que a de muitos países desenvolvidos”, afirmou.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of international entities']",mensagem Lula combustível fóssil convite opep+ presidente Luiz Inácio Lula Silva afirmar sexta-feira dia economia mundial precisar enfrentar debate combustível fóssil diminuir utilização discurso presidente acontecer cop emirado árabe Unidos dia Brasil receber convite organização país exportador petróleo aliado opep+ juntar mundo convencido potencial energia renovável enfrentar debate ritmo lento descarbonização planeta trabalhar economia dependente combustível fóssil afirmar abertura discurso Lula chamar atenção aumento temperatura global planeta evento global extremo seca histórico amazónia ciclone Região sul Brasil conta chegar dizer presidente afirmar planeta farto acordo clima fazer cumprir reiterar Brasil disposto liderar véspera Brasil receber convite integrar opep+ organização controlar preço petróleo cartel produtor arábia saudito ir iraque emirado árabe Unidos venezuela país aliado méxico Rússia organização aumento produção combustível controlar commodity mercado internacional visão diferente defender lula discurso cop continuidade uso combustível fóssil sexta-feira presidente petrobra Jean paul prate afirmar agência reuter Brasil integrar produtor petróleo opep+ país papel cooperação observação decisão participar quota produção chamar país direito voto impor quota participaríar entidade estabelecer quota Brasil petrobra empresa abrir mercado quota afirmar executivo defesa uso energia renovável evidente saia-justa pais colocar aceitar ingressar opep+ Lula dizer discurso gasto arma guerra dever usar fome mudança climático quanto tonelada carbono emitir míssil cruzar céu desabam civis inocente sobretudo criança mulher presidente dizer mundo naturalizar disparidade inaceitável rendimento género raça enfrentar mudança clima combater desigualdade discurso Lula criticar postura onu incapacidade manter paz simplesmente membro lucr guerra organização nação unir Rússia ucrânia Israel país membro governante eximir responsabilidade nenhum país resolver problema sozinho estar obrigar atuar conjunto fronteira Brasil disposto liderar ajustár meta hoje ambicioso país desenvolver afirmar

A reconstrução do estado do Rio Grande do Sul vai exigir recursos públicos e privados nos próximos meses. A afirmação é do Presidente Lula, que cumpriu uma agenda na cidade do Rio de Janeiro na manhã desta quarta-feira (12).

O Presidente esteve acompanhado por ministros do Governo Federal, autoridades políticas e empresários do setor energético e transição ecológica, tecnologia e inovação e inclusão social, no Copacabana Palace, na zona sul do Rio.

O político participou na sessão de abertura do Fórum de Investimento Prioritário 2024 do Instituto da Iniciativa de Investimento Futuro (FII Institute), realizado pela primeira vez na América Latina.

Lula disse que o capital privado pode ser um aliado na reconstrução do Rio Grande do Sul, se for investido com a mesma visão do Estado.

Estamos a viver as alterações climáticas em primeira mão com as cheias do Rio Grande do Sul, cuja reconstrução exigirá investimentos maciços do governo e do setor privado. Não há negacionismo capaz de refutar a tragédia que se abateu sobre os nossos irmãos gaúchos. O investimento público é decisivo para induzir o desenvolvimento. Mas o capital privado pode ser um aliado dinâmico, se Estado e empresariado convergirem em torno da mesma visão de futuro.

No início da semana, a Federação das Indústrias do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul entregou aos deputados estaduais, federais e senadores um documento com mais de 70 propostas de medidas consideradas urgentes para a recuperação do setor industrial e da economia do estado.

Em maio, o Presidente Lula anunciou um pacote de 12 medidas com mais de 8,2 mil milhões de euros para ajudar as famílias, os trabalhadores rurais, as empresas e os municípios do Rio Grande do Sul.

Mais de 16 mil empresas foram afetadas pelas cheias, segundo o Sebrae. A maioria são micro, pequenas ou de empresários em nome individual. Apenas 4% vão conseguir retomar a normalidade até julho.

O estudo, publicado no sábado na revista cientifica Scientific Reports, do grupo Nature, analisou “um conjunto de dados sem precedentes” recolhidos ao longo de um ano em grutas de vários pontos do globo, desde as regiões subárticas às tropicais, incluindo, em Portugal, grutas no centro do país, no Algarve e nos Açores.

Ao longo de um ano, a cada duas horas foi medida a temperatura em grutas e à superfície, totalizando mais de 100.000 medições, que “demonstram que a temperatura nas grutas corresponde à temperatura média anual da superfície para cada local”, disse Ana Sofia Reboleira, Professora na Faculdade de Ciências da Universidade de Lisboa e investigadora no Centro de Ecologia, Evolução e Alterações Ambientais, à agência Lusa.

Segundo a bióloga “as grutas responderam com três padrões diferentes”: um em que a variação da temperatura exterior se reflete na gruta com um pequeno atraso, outro em que as temperaturas na superfície rapidamente se refletem no interior e, um terceiro em que funcionam em espelho, quanto mais baixa a temperatura à superfície mais alta dentro da gruta e vice-versa.

Mais surpreendente, foi a descoberta da “existência de ciclos térmicos diários em algumas cavernas”, considerada pela investigadora “particularmente interessante porque em ecossistemas com total ausência de luz, os organismos carecem de ritmos circadianos, ou seja, ritmos biológicos marcados pela natural cadência do dia e da noite controlada pela luz solar à superfície”.

Esta descoberta “mostra que estes ciclos térmicos diários podem potencialmente controlar os ritmos biológicos dos organismos subterrâneos”, uma hipótese que se coloca pela primeira vez na história da Biologia.

“Estes ecossistemas são habitados por espécies únicas que têm um papel importantíssimo naquilo que os cientistas chamam os serviços dos ecossistemas” já que, explicou, “são estes animais que garantem a reciclagem dos nutrientes em profundidade, de alguns contaminantes que lá chegam, que controlam o crescimento bacteriano e outro tipo de problemáticas que nos podem afetar”.

Tratando-se de organismos adaptados a baixas amplitudes e reduzida variabilidade térmica o aumento das temperaturas em vários graus, devido às alterações climáticas, “seguramente afetará estes organismos responsáveis por garantir o bom estado ecológico destas massas de água” subterrâneas, que representam 97% dos recursos totais de água doce disponível para o consumo humano imediato.

De entre as grutas tratadas no estudo, a cientista destaca o caso de uma em Loulé que registou a temperatura mais elevada à superfície, com mais de 39 graus, e outra nos Açores, com a maior amplitude térmica, com uma variação de 8,8, explicada pelo facto de ser uma gruta vulcânica.

O impacto das alterações climáticas, aliado ao facto de os ecossistemas subterrâneos “serem constantemente negligenciados nas agendas políticas e públicas”, levam os investigadores a avançar agora com estudos laboratoriais “sobre os efeito da subida das temperatura nestes organismos” visando estimar as temperaturas máximas que estes conseguirão aguentar.

O estudo agora publicado contou, além da coordenadora, com a participação de Maria João Medina, aluna de mestrado em cuja dissertação se inclui o estudo, e de Paulo Borges da Universidade dos Açores. A nível internacional o trabalho envolveu investigadores dos Estados Unidos, Sérvia, Eslovénia, Noruega, Espanha (incluindo Ilhas Canárias), Croácia e ilha de Guam, no Pacífico.

O mundo enfrenta uma invulgar época de incêndios florestais, com regiões próximas e distantes cada vez mais afetadas pela exposição ao fumo. Na Grécia, por exemplo, um incêndio devora as encostas do Monte Parnitha, nos arredores da capital Atenas, e já fez 20 mortos. Em Espanha, as chamas consumiram quase 15 mil hectares, o equivalente a 7% da ilha de Tenerife, no arquipélago turístico das Canárias. Já nos Estados Unidos, os incêndios florestais que destruíram a ilha de Maui, no Havai, fizeram pelo menos 115 mortos.

No Brasil, por causa do tempo quente e seco, a Defesa Civil de São Paulo emitiu um alerta para a possibilidade de incêndios em todo o estado até ao final da semana, devido a uma onda de calor.

Perante o cenário, especialistas de todo o mundo debruçam-se sobre os efeitos da poluição do ar provocada por estes fenómenos naturais.

O americano médio já tinha sido exposto a 450 microgramas de fumo por metro cúbico, no início de julho, uma medida pior do que o total identificado entre 2006 e 2022, alertou recentemente o economista da Universidade de Stanford Marshall Burke, na rede social X (antigo Twitter), citando cálculos realizados pelo Laboratório de Alterações Ambientais e Resultados Humanos da instituição de ensino.

Existe, também, preocupação sobre as substâncias invisíveis conhecidas como compostos orgânicos voláteis (COV), como o butano. Provocam irritação nos olhos e na garganta e alguns são conhecidos como cancerígenos.

Com o aumento da compra de automóveis após a Segunda Guerra Mundial, nas décadas seguintes, os cientistas obtiveram informações sobre o seu impacto nos seres humanos, desde o início da asma, durante a infância, até ao aumento do risco de enfarte e à demência, em fases mais tardias.

No entanto, este conhecimento não existe no caso do fumo proveniente de incêndios florestais, explicou Christopher Carlsten, diretor do Laboratório de Exposição à Poluição Atmosférica da Universidade da Colúmbia Britânica.

Com base em dezenas de estudos publicados, “parece haver uma maior proporção de efeitos respiratórios do que cardiovasculares do fumo em comparação com a poluição do trânsito”, disse à agência AFP.

O laboratório onde Carlsten trabalha iniciou experiências em humanos com fumo de lenha para obter mais clareza. De acordo com o especialista, que também é médico, podem ser tomadas algumas medidas sanitárias nestes casos, como os corticoides inalados, os anti-inflamatórios não esteróides e os filtros de ar, mas é necessário investigar para saber qual a melhor forma de as utilizar.

A sua casa fica numa aldeia do Mato Grosso, no coração da Amazónia brasileira. Mas, desde há algum tempo, o seu palco é o mundo inteiro. Onde quer que seja convidado, vai, porque o líder indígena Raoni Metuktire, hoje com 93 anos, consagrou a sua vida não só à defesa da floresta amazónica, mas para alertar que, face aos desastres climáticos da nossa época, “nada se salva sozinho”.

Isto levou-o, há um ano, a desfilar na passadeira vermelha do Festival de Cannes, e a ir em março último a Belém, onde o presidente francês, Emmanuel Macron, acompanhado pelo seu homólogo brasileiro, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, presenteou-o com a insígnia da Legião de Honra.

E agora uma nova oportunidade foi-lhe oferecida pelo Papa Francisco, que o quis entre os protagonistas da cimeira internacional “Da crise climática à resistência climática”, que se realizou na Casina Pio VI, da Cidade do Vaticano.

Evocando o encontro que teve com o Pontífice, Raoni disse à ANSA: “Pedi-lhe que deixasse claro aos católicos que o seguem no Brasil qual é a orientação da Igreja sobre as questões ambientais, porque às vezes parecem não ter percebido a mensagem” .

Expressando-se na língua do povo indígena Mebengokre, Raoni salientou que “está a ser criado progressivamente um vazio em torno das nossas terras na Amazónia e já não há nada verdadeiramente protegido”.

“Vivemos quase em ilhas e, como se não bastasse, há pessoas que não estão satisfeitas, que querem atacar até as reservas onde vivemos, pondo em causa a nossa sobrevivência”.

“O que está a acontecer?"", questionou, acrescentando que se “preocupa porque as pessoas que vivem no mundo desenvolvido não entendem que isto é um problema para nós, mas também para eles”.

Segundo o cacique, agora no Brasil, ""estamos perante um 'monstro' com duas cabeças: por um lado os graves fenómenos de seca no norte do país, onde os incêndios se multiplicam, e, por outro, a tragédia das inundações, como a um ocorrido recentemente no Sul do Brasil"".

Com o foco nas terras indígenas, Raoni recordou que, “quando Lula se tornou presidente, prometeu-me que as demarcaria claramente”.

“Ainda estou à espera que isso aconteça. É claro que temos melhores relações com o seu governo do que quando Jair Bolsonaro estava no poder. Mas neste momento para nós há muitas palavras, mas poucas ações”.

Dirigindo-se ao numeroso grupo de especialistas que o ouviram e que no final da exposição o ovacionaram de pé na cúpula, Raoni argumentou que “o mundo desenvolvido parece convencido da urgência da luta contra as alterações climáticas”.

“Mas agora precisamos de decidir financiar imediatamente as ferramentas para iniciar os projetos necessários, antes que seja tarde demais. É inútil lembrar que, normalmente, não usamos dinheiro nas nossas reservas. O dinheiro, em grandes quantidades, é utilizado no mundo desenvolvido”, afirmou, garantindo que “é chegada a hora de utilizar [o dinheiro] para salvar a vida no planeta”.

Os ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Rússia e da China reuniram-se, esta quinta-feira (25), e conversaram sobre a construção de ""uma nova arquitetura de segurança"", informou Moscovo, após o encontro que decorreu à margem da reunião de ministros da Associação Nacional do Sudeste Asiático (Asean), no Laos.

Na reunião, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Serguei Lavrov, e o seu homólogo chinês, Wang Yi, analisaram em ""pormenor"" temas de cooperação no âmbito da Asean, declarou o ministro russo, num comunicado publicado após o encontro em Vientiane, na capital de Laos.

Lavrov afirmou que, numa altura em que “alguns países” estão a criar “uma aliança estreita” com mecanismos político-militares destinados a minar a segurança e a estabilidade na região da Ásia-Pacífico, os dois ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros discutiram a construção de “uma nova arquitetura de segurança”.

Wang disse que a China está “pronta para trabalhar com a Rússia para manter a arquitetura de cooperação regional centrada na Asean, aberta e inclusiva” face a “perturbações e obstáculos externos”, informou a agência estatal chinesa Xinhua.

Lavrov e Wang falaram à margem da reunião ministerial anual dos dez membros da Asean, que começou esta quinta-feira e durará três dias, com a presença também de ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros que não pertencem ao bloco regional.

O chefe da diplomacia norte-americana, o secretário de Estado Anthony Blinken, tem previsto participar no próximo sábado na reunião ministerial.

O encontro acontece um dia depois de Wang se ter reunido com o seu homólogo ucraniano, Dmytro Kuleba, na China.

A China é um aliado da Rússia e os membros da NATO consideram que Pequim tem um papel “decisivo” para Moscovo desde a invasão da Ucrânia em Fevereiro de 2022.

Antes da reunião, Lavrov declarou que a Asean é “um dos elementos essenciais para uma nova ordem multipolar e mais justa”.

""Mais de 100 pessoas morreram no distrito de Baghalan Jadid"" em Baghlan e ""100 pessoas foram mortas"" no de Burqa, disse à AFP um responsável da Organização Internacional para as Migrações (OIM), estimando mais de 2.000 casas destruídas.

A OIM acrescentou que foram registadas várias mortes em outros seis distritos de Baghlan, com base em números fornecidos pela Autoridade Nacional de Gestão de Desastres (ANDMA).

As autoridades provinciais tinham avançado 62 mortos desde sexta-feira, mas avisaram que ""provavelmente aumentaria"".

As inundações desta primavera anormalmente chuvosa afetaram também outras províncias do Afeganistão, um dos países mais vulneráveis ​​às alterações climáticas no mundo, mas também um dos mais mal preparados para as suas consequências, segundo os cientistas.

O porta-voz do Governo, Zabihullah Mujahid, disse hoje à AFP que se registaram ""dezenas de mortos"" em várias províncias do país, um dos mais pobres do mundo.

O Ministério da Defesa indicou hoje que ""foram iniciadas operações de distribuição de alimentos, medicamentos e 'kits' de primeiros socorros às vítimas"".

""A Força Aérea começou a retirar os residentes à medida que o tempo melhorou"" e transferiu mais de uma centena de feridos para os hospitais, acrescentou.

Jan Mohammad Din Mohammad, residente em Pol-e Khomri, capital de Baghlan, disse à AFP que a casa que construiu com as suas próprias mãos foi completamente destruída.

""Vi a minha família a correr em direção aos montes. A minha casa e toda a minha vida foram-me tiradas. Foi inimaginável"", lamentou.

Adicionalmente, as autoridades de gestão de catástrofes da província de Takhar, vizinha de Baghlan, reportaram 20 mortes e 14 feridos na sexta-feira.

""Além das perdas humanas, estas inundações causaram perdas financeiras gigantescas"", disse à AFP um funcionário daquele departamento.

A enviada norte-americana para o Afeganistão, Rina Amiri, escreveu nas redes sociais: ""o meu coração está com as vítimas das cheias no Afeganistão, que ceifaram muitas vidas humanas e causaram danos significativos"".

A responsável pediu ao Governo dos talibãs ""que enfrente a devastação provocada pelas alterações climáticas"" no país já devastado por quatro décadas de guerra.

Desde meados de Abril, as cheias e inundações já provocaram cerca de uma centena de mortos em dez províncias do país e nenhuma região foi poupada.

Também destruíram centenas de casas e submergiram muitas terras agrícolas num país onde 80% dos mais de 40 milhões de habitantes dependem da agricultura para a sua sobrevivência.

O Afeganistão viveu um inverno muito seco, dificultando a absorção da chuva pelo solo.

PT_310.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Ursos polares invadem bairro residencial no Canadá

Os habitantes da cidade situada nas margens da Baía de Hudson, na província de Manitoba, estão sempre em alerta com a presença comum destes grandes carnívoros. Churchill tem uma população modesta, cerca de 900 pessoas, e, durante o verão, recebe a ""visita"" dos temidos ursos.

A chegada dos ursos polares nos meses do fim do ano ocorre pelo facto de Churchill estar na rota migratória destes mamíferos. Com o degelo no Ártico no verão, os ursos polares migram à espera do novo congelamento.

Placas a alertar para a possibilidade de nos depararmos com um urso estão espalhadas pelos espaços públicos, bem como locais onde os agentes podem reter ursos para envio para cativeiro.

De acordo com a BBC, os moradores andam cautelosos pelas ruas no período em que ocorre a invasão dos ursos polares. O concelho tem até uma estátua do animal.

No feriado de Halloween (31 de outubro), os polícias de patrulha de ursos escoltam as crianças fantasiadas que circulam pelo bairro para brincar aos ""doces ou travessuras"". De acordo com o jornal inglês The Guardian, o último registo de um ataque dos ursos polares a humanos em Churchill foi precisamente num Halloween. O episódio aconteceu em 2013 e vitimou dois moradores às primeiras horas da manhã.

Uma recomendação das autoridades locais é que os residentes evitem circular nas ruas durante a noite nesta altura do ano. A circulação dos ursos pelas ruas de Churchill fez com que as empresas começassem a organizar passeios dentro das normas de segurança pública.

Nos últimos anos, a quantidade de ursos polares e o seu tempo de permanência na cidade tem vindo a tornar-se maior, fenómeno atribuído pelos estudiosos ao aquecimento global.

Isto acontece porque as alterações climáticas têm afetado o processo de formação do gelo.

Outro efeito do aquecimento é que a cidade de Churchill tem estado mais quente, o que, a médio prazo, pode afetar a sobrevivência da espécie, que precisa de preservar gordura durante a estadia em terra firme.

""A época intermédia - onde os ursos estão em terra e não podem aproveitar as oportunidades de caça - está a tornar-se cada vez mais longa com o aquecimento global"", explicou o investigador Flavio Lehner à BBC.

PT_01.txt,CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups,CC: Hidden plots by secret schemes of powerful groups: Climate agenda has hidden motives,"Ativistas climáticos ou idiotas úteis?

“Pela libertação da Palestina das garras do Estado sionista, pelo fim do genocídio e pelo fim ao fóssil.”

O pináculo do idiotismo útil. Os jovens, historicamente, em geral sempre foram massa de manobra de determinadas elites ideológicas. Os movimentos sociais são quase sempre inorgânicos, quase sempre artificiais, fabricados nas universidades e depois amplificados pelos “donos” das narrativas e pelos detentores dos instrumentos dominantes no sistema de comunicação, neste caso a comunicação social.

Não é por acaso que as redes sociais são completamente atacadas de todas as formas, precisamente por causa disso. As redes sociais, o que vieram fazer, foi retirar o monopólio das narrativas aos donos do sistema de comunicação.

Qual é que é o principal objetivo destes movimentos sociais?

O principal ou único objetivo, independentemente de se os ativistas estarem conscientes ou não, alguns estarão conscientes, outros não têm a mínima noção – acreditam estarem a defender causas muito importantes. Mas o grande objetivo é a destruição da infraestrutura da sociedade ocidental, ou em linguagem marxista, da sociedade “capitalista burguesa”.

Utilizam inúmeras ferramentas: o movimento LGBT, instrumentalizado para destruir a família tradicional, que é a base de qualquer sociedade saudável e civilizada e é a base da civilização ocidental. A “loucura climática”, que o que pretende é retirar liberdades às pessoas. O fim ao fóssil, que entronca nas alterações climáticas, no fundo o que pretende, é destruir a base energética do modelo capitalista burguês.

A propósito desta ação na Faculdade de Psicologia – o anti sionismo. O sionismo é um movimento político nacionalista. Aí é que está o problema. O comunismo é uma das correntes globalistas e é intrinsecamente internacionalista, a Nação é para ser destruída e, por isso, o Estado de Israel sionista é um problema (antinacionalismo judaico).

Todos estes instrumentos, concorrem para a destruição dos pilares que sustentam o edifício da civilização ocidental e o objetivo é destruí-los, para que esteja aberto o caminho para o fim da economia de mercado. Torna-se assim mais fácil, a abertura do caminho para o totalitarismo comunista, que recorre a novos instrumentos que não apenas o ortodoxo ou a original luta de classes – proletariado versus patrões.

A Nação é o “némesis” dos globalistas e o marxismo cultural é o novo comunismo nos dias de hoje, sendo um dos movimentos globalistas que temos neste momento, para além do globalismo liberal liderado pelos EUA.

Em suma, isto é idiotismo útil, é simplesmente uma cópia dos movimentos sociais inorgânicos que nascem nas Universidades americanas e que depois são importadas para Portugal, com o único objetivo de destruir as bases da civilização ocidental e diluir as Nações por dentro.

O presidente da Bielorrússia, Alexander Lukashenko, aliado próximo de Vladimir Putin, fez uma declaração contundente, alertando que a escalada das tensões na região de Kursk poderá levar à destruição da Ucrânia.

Neste domingo, Alexander Lukashenko, presidente da Bielorrússia, fez uma declaração firme sobre a atual situação na fronteira entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia. “Se prosseguir o que está a acontecer em Kursk, começará uma escalada que terminará com a destruição da Ucrânia. Nunca ninguém derrotou este império e ninguém derrotará a Rússia”, afirmou Lukashenko, sublinhando o seu apoio incondicional à Rússia.

Lukashenko também alertou que a fronteira entre a Bielorrússia e a Ucrânia está atualmente “minada como nunca antes” e advertiu que as tropas ucranianas sofreriam perdas massivas se tentassem cruzá-la.

Nos últimos dias, as tensões na fronteira diminuíram após a crise provocada pela incursão de um drone ucraniano no espaço aéreo bielorrusso, o que levou Lukashenko a ordenar o envio de “um terço do Exército” para a região fronteiriça.

Segundo o presidente bielorrusso, os serviços diplomáticos do país conseguiram desarmar a situação através de um canal de comunicação especial com os seus homólogos ucranianos, que atribuíram o incidente a um mal-entendido. “Pensavam que íamos atacar na região de Gomel, algo que nem nos passou pela cabeça”, explicou Lukashenko, referindo-se à concentração de “120.000 militares na fronteira” pela Ucrânia durante o auge da crise. “Felizmente, retiraram esse contingente, e nós fizemos o mesmo com o nosso”, informou Lukashenko, citado pelo canal russo Rossiya 1.

Uma nova investigação sobre os efeitos do aquecimento global na saúde humana concluiu que são já visíveis as consequências da mudança climática, prevendo-se impactos cada vez mais graves no futuro.

O relatório “O Imperativo da Ação Climática para Proteger a Saúde Humana na Europa”, elaborado por especialistas de 27 academias nacionais de ciência, alerta para o risco de os efeitos diretos desse aquecimento provocarem mais vítimas - resultado das ondas de calor extremo ou do aumento das inundações - mas chama também a atenção para os efeitos indiretos, desde a propagação de doenças transmitidas por mosquitos até ao agravamento dos casos de doenças do foro mental. Aqui se incluem como problemas como “stress pós-traumático, ansiedade, abuso de substâncias e depressão”, aponta o estudo.

Em função das conclusões, Andrew Haines, co-presidente do Conselho Consultivo da Academia Europeia de Ciências, não duvidou em avançar que “as alterações climáticas devem ser classificadas como uma das mais sérias ameaças à saúde”.

São inquietantes os cenários traçados, com o relatório a antecipar a propagação de doenças infecciosas na Europa à medida que as temperaturas aumentam e aumenta a variedade de mosquitos. As preocupações abrangem o risco de poderem aumentar as intoxicações alimentares, já que as bactérias prosperaram em ambientes mais quentes.

“Estamos a sujeitar os jovens e as gerações futuras a esses riscos de saúde crescentes por muitas centenas de anos, se não milénios”, disse Andrew Haines, apelando a práticas urgentes para contrariar as perspetivas atuais.

Num plano mais otimista, a investigação assinala que as ações já tomadas para reduzir as emissões de carbono permitiram benefícios importantes, sobretudo pela redução do número de mortes prematuras, atribuídas à poluição do ar na Europa – estão a morrer menos 350.000 pessoas por ano.

O relatório avança também que mesmo pequenos cortes na ingestão de carne podem resultar em cortes significativos nas emissões de carbono, além de trazerem benefícios do ponto de vista da saúde.

O ex-Presidente russo, Dmitry Medvedev, disse que a adesão da Ucrânia à NATO seria uma declaração de guerra contra Moscovo e que só a ""prudência"" em nome da aliança poderia evitar que o planeta fosse despedaçado.

Os líderes da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte comprometeram-se, na sua cimeira da semana passada, a apoiar a Ucrânia num ""caminho irreversível para a plena integração euro-atlântica, incluindo a adesão à NATO"", mas deixaram em aberto quando é que essa adesão poderá acontecer.

Medvedev, vice-presidente do Conselho de Segurança da Rússia e uma voz de liderança entre os falcões do Kremlin, disse ao meio de comunicação Argumenty I Fakty que a adesão da Ucrânia iria além de uma ameaça direta à segurança de Moscovo.

""Isto, no fundo, seria uma declaração de guerra – embora com atraso"", disse em comentários publicados na quarta-feira.

""As ações que os opositores da Rússia têm tomado contra nós durante anos, expandindo a aliança, levam a NATO a um ponto de não retorno"".

Numa linha padrão do Kremlin desde a invasão em grande escala da Ucrânia por Moscovo em 2022, Medvedev disse que a Rússia não ameaçava a NATO, mas responderia às tentativas da aliança de promover os seus interesses.

""Quanto mais tentativas deste tipo existirem, mais duras se tornarão as nossas respostas"", disse Medvedev. ""Se isto irá despedaçar o planeta inteiro depende unicamente da prudência do lado (da NATO).""

O Ministério Público (MP) arquivou o inquérito sobre o protesto de ativistas ambientais do Climáximo ocorrido há um ano no aeroporto Humberto Delgado, em Lisboa, em que se colaram a um avião, revelou este sábado o grupo.

Em comunicado, o grupo Climáximo congratulou-se com o arquivamento deste inquérito, considerando que “é um exemplo claro de que a repressão judicial sobre aquelas que lutam pela vida de todos é uma opção do sistema, existindo alternativas”.

As forças policiais, os juízes e o MP “têm nas suas mãos a possibilidade” de escolher entre “continuar a manter um sistema que está em guerra com a sociedade e o planeta ou recusar-se a consentir com um aparelho de destruição”, afirmaram.

Porém, o Climáximo lamentou que o grupo tenha “mais de nove mil euros em multas para pagar” e que a alguns dos seus elementos tenham sido aplicadas “penas suspensas de mais de um ano”, tendo ambos os casos resultado de condenações por protestos.

Na manhã de 18 de outubro de 2023, ativistas do grupo colaram-se a um avião da TAP que ia fazer a ligação entre Lisboa e Porto, num protesto contra as emissões de gases com efeito de estufa de voos de curta distância e para apelar ao uso de outros meios de transporte coletivos públicos.

No despacho de arquivamento, a que a Lusa teve hoje acesso, pode ler-se que “não consta que, em momento algum, o comandante, que é autoridade a bordo da aeronave, nem os agentes da PSP tenham cominado [ameaçado] a qualquer dos agora arguidos a prática do crime de desobediência, pelo que não incorreram na sua prática”.

“Sucede que a manifestação espontânea não decorreu em lugar público, nem na verdade de modo a suscitar a necessidade de regulação da circulação automóvel e de peões, que é a razão de ser da obrigação de comunicação prévia” à câmara, salientou.

O MP alegou ainda que “o avião não se enquadra, enquanto ‘lugar’, na previsão legal” e, como a manifestação espontânea foi realizada naquele meio de transporte, os arguidos “não incorreram na prática de qualquer crime”.

De acordo com o despacho do MP, o grupo do Climáximo era constituído seis pessoas, mas apenas uma delas usou um tubo de cola que pôs nas mãos e tentou colocar-se à porta da aeronave, sendo, depois, retirada pelas autoridades policiais.

O comandante do avião, segundo o documento, chamou as autoridades policiais por se recusar a transportar estas pessoas, pelo que foram retiradas, tendo prosseguido os procedimentos de fecho de portas e descolagem, sem qualquer incidente.

Os ativistas ambientais foram constituídos arguidos por suspeita de terem incorrido na prática de um crime de desobediência, relacionada com a falta de comunicação prévia do protesto à Câmara de Lisboa, é ainda referido no despacho.",PT,['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities'],['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Other'],ativista climáximo colar avião Lisboa ilibados multa ministério Público mp arquivar inquérito protesto ativista ambiental climáximo ocorrer haver ano aeroporto humberto delgar Lisboa colar avião revelar sábado comunicar climáximo congratulou se arquivamento inquérito considerar claro repressão judicial lutar vida opção existir alternativa força policial juíz mp mão possibilidade escolher continuar manter guerra sociedade planeta recusar se consentir aparelho destruição afirmar climáximo lamentar ter euro multa pagar elemento ter ser aplicar pena suspenso ano ter caso resultado condenação protesto manhã outubro ativista colaram-se avião tap ir ligação Lisboa Porto protesto emissão gase efeito estufa voos curto distância apelar uso meio transporte coletivo público despacho arquivamento lusa hoje acesso ler-se constar algum comandante autoridade bordo aeronave agente psp ter cominar ameaçar arguir prática crime desobediência incorrer prática sucedir manifestação espontâneo decorrer público verdade modo suscitar necessidade regulação circulação automóvel peão razão obrigação comunicação prévio câmara salientar mp alegar avião enquadra previsão legal manifestação espontâneo realizar transporte arguido incorrer prática crime acordo despacho mp climáximo constituir pessoa usar tubo cola pôr mão tentar colocar se porta aeronave ser retirar autoridade policial comandante avião documento chamar autoridade policial recusar transportar pessoa retirar ter prosseguer procedimento fecho porta descolagem incidente ativista ambiental constituír arguir suspeita ter incorrir prática crime desobediência relacionar comunicação prévio protesto câmara Lisboa referir despacho

O presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, recebeu esta quarta-feira no Kremlin o primeiro-ministro chinês, Li Qiang, que assinou esta manhã um acordo de cooperação em investimentos no âmbito da sua visita oficial a este país.

“Os nossos países desenvolveram planos conjuntos de grande escala nas esferas económica e humanitária, esperamos que para muitos anos”, disse Putin no início da reunião.

O líder russo, que visitou a China em maio passado, assegurou que as relações comerciais bilaterais estão a desenvolver-se “com sucesso”.

Acompanhado pelo ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Serguei Lavrov, Putin recordou que o dia 2 de outubro assinalará o 75.º aniversário do estabelecimento das relações diplomáticas entre os dois países e convidou Li a participar no Fórum Económico Oriental, que se realizará em setembro em Vladivostok, capital do Extremo Oriente russo.

Li sublinhou que esta é a sua primeira visita ao estrangeiro desde que assumiu a liderança do Conselho de Estado e recordou que a a economia russa tem crescido de forma constante “nos últimos dois anos”, coincidindo com a guerra na Ucrânia, sob a direção “bem-sucedida” de Putin.

“Estamos prontos para implementar plenamente os acordos convosco ao mais alto nível e expandir constantemente a cooperação multilateral mutuamente benéfica”, prometeu o primeiro-ministro chinês.

Li e o seu homólogo russo, Mikhail Mishustin, assinaram esta quarta-feira, após negociações em Moscovo, um plano de cooperação de investimento e dois memorandos de cooperação nos transportes e na indústria química.

O primeiro-ministro chinês sublinhou que o seu país, em face de uma “mudança da situação internacional”, está disponível para avançar com a Rússia “com mais firmeza” na linha definida pelos líderes de ambos os países para o bem do seu povo e também “para a justiça em todo o mundo”.",PT,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other']",putin receber primeiro-ministro chinês saúda acordo investimento bilateral presidente russo vladimir putin receber quarta-feira kremlin primeiro-ministro chinês li Qiang assinar manhã acordo cooperação investimento âmbito visita oficial país país desenvolver plano conjunto escala esfera económico humanitário esperar ano dizer putin início reunião líder russo visitar china maio passado assegurar relação comercial bilateral desenvolver-se sucesso acompanhar ministro negócio estrangeiro serguei lavrov putin recordar dia outubro assinalar aniversário estabelecimento relação diplomático país convidar li participar fórum económico oriental realizar setembro vladivostok capital extremo oriente russo li sublinhar visita estrangeiro assumir liderança recordar economia russo crescer constante último ano coincidir guerra ucrânia direção bem-sucedida putin estar pronto implementar plenamente acordo convosco alto expandir constantemente cooperação multilateral mutuamente benéfico prometer primeiro-ministro chinês li homólogo russo mikhail Mishustin assinar quarta-feira negociação Moscovo plano cooperação investimento memorando cooperação transporte indústria químico primeiro-ministro chinês sublinhar país face mudança situação internacional disponível avançar rússia firmeza linha definir líder país justiça mundo
PT_321.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"'Thanksgiving' sem peru? Porque é que ave pode ficar de fora da ceia em breve

No dia 23 de novembro, celebra-se o famoso Dia de Ação de Graças nos Estados Unidos. O feriado norte americano é conhecido por reunir familiares e amigos em torno de mesas fartas, sendo o peru o prato principal, tal como acontece no Natal entre os brasileiros.

Este ano, no entanto, a Revista Forbes levanta um alerta. Em breve, a ave poderá ficar de fora do menu das ceias norte-americanas por influência dos efeitos das alterações climáticas.

Isto porque, nos EUA, a maioria dos perus é produzida em explorações agrícolas com uma dieta à base de milho, que sofre com uma quebra de produtividade devido às altas temperaturas e às secas que assolam as culturas, como refere um relatório publicado pela NASA.

A Administração Nacional da Aeronáutica e do Espaço alerta mesmo que o rendimento médio global das culturas de milho poderá diminuir um quarto no final do século se as tendências das alterações climáticas se mantiverem.

Segundo o National Agricultural Statistics Service (USDA), Departamento de Agricultura dos Estados Unidos, mais de metade dos quase 300 milhões de hectares de terra agrícola do país é utilizada para a produção de milho e bagaço de soja destinados à alimentação de animais do setor rural .

Recorde-se que o cenário fez com que o Brasil ultrapassasse os Estados Unidos este ano, tornando-se o maior exportador de milho do mundo. Foram 56 milhões de toneladas de milho produzidas na campanha 2022/2023, enquanto os EUA venderam 41,277 milhões de toneladas, de acordo com o USDA.

O impacto negativo dos veículos de passageiros no clima, que é considerável, poderia ter caído mais de 30% na última década se não fosse o apetite do mundo por carros grandes, sugere um novo relatório da Iniciativa Global de Economia de Combustível.

O transporte é responsável por cerca de um quarto de todos os gases que causam o aquecimento climático provenientes da energia, e grande parte disso pode ser atribuído ao transporte de passageiros, segundo a Agência Internacional de Energia.

Mas o impacto ambiental negativo dos SUV poderia ter sido reduzido em mais de um terço entre 2010 e 2022, se as pessoas tivessem continuado a comprar carros do mesmo tamanho, de acordo com a iniciativa, uma parceria global de grupos de veículos mais limpos.

Uma solução para isto poderá ser os veículos elétricos (VEs).

George Parrott, um ávido corredor de 79 anos, que vive em West Sacramento, na Califórnia, decidiu mudar para veículos mais limpos em 2004, quando comprou um Toyota Prius híbrido. Desde então, teve vários carros puramente elétricos e atualmente tem um SUV elétrico Genesis GV60 e um Tesla Model 3.

Nem todos os consumidores pensam da mesma forma em relação ao consumo de energia e aos benefícios ambientais, especialmente nos EUA. Embora as vendas de VE tenham representado 15% do mercado automóvel global no ano passado, esta percentagem foi de apenas 7,3% nos EUA.

Entretanto, os veículos mais pequenos, ou sedans, perderam muito terreno no mercado americano na última década. Em 2012, os sedans representaram 50% do espaço de retalho automóvel nos EUA, com os SUV com pouco mais de 30%, e os camiões com 13,5%, segundo a empresa de compra de automóveis Edmunds. Em 2022, a quota dos sedans nos EUA caiu para 21%, enquanto os SUV atingiram os 54,5%, e os camiões cresceram para 20%.

“As pessoas não querem ser limitadas pelo espaço no carro”, disse Eric Frehsée, presidente do Grupo Tamaroff de concessionários no sudeste do Michigan. “Toda a gente quer um carro para sete passageiros”.

“Tudo isto foi uma combinação de amplas preocupações ambientais”, disse.

Estão a ser feitos mais esforços do Departamento de Transportes dos EUA, da Agência de Proteção Ambiental e da Administração Nacional de Segurança do Tráfego Rodoviário para melhorar a economia de combustível e as emissões de escape dos veículos movidos a gasolina. Algumas iniciativas poderiam incluir os SUV, o que deixou o setor em alvoroço.

O Exército da Ucrânia não tem qualquer hipótese de ganhar o conflito com a Rússia, pois os EUA e o Ocidente vão em breve trair Kiev, disse o presidente do partido turco Vatan (Pátria), Dogu Perincek.

Ultimamente, vários meios de comunicação ocidentais já admitem que o Exército ucraniano está a perder território diariamente e que o Ocidente reconhece que a situação para a Ucrânia só vai piorar.

""O conflito vai terminar com sucessos [da Rússia] na linha da frente. Este será o ponto final. O Exército ucraniano não tem hipótese. O ponto final vai ser definido pelos sucessos do Exército russo"", disse o político à Sputnik.

Segundo ele, no outro lado da moeda está a posição dos Estados Unidos e do Ocidente em geral. ""As forças dos EUA e do Ocidente, depois de verem o fiasco do Exército ucraniano, trairão imediatamente a Ucrânia. Vimos isso no Afeganistão. A mesma coisa vai acontecer com a Ucrânia. O Ocidente vai abandonar [o atual líder ucraniano Vladimir] Zelensky e pensar apenas no seu próprio benefício"", enfatizou.

Recentemente, Zelensky apresentou um plano para resolver o conflito na Ucrânia. O documento inclui cinco pontos e três anexos secretos.

O primeiro ponto é a Ucrânia ser convidada a aderir à Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) o que, aliás, foi uma das razões da operação militar especial russa. 

O segundo é a Ucrânia ser autorizada a utilizar armas de longo alcance ocidentais contra territórios russos longe da zona de conflito. O presidente da Rússia, Vladimir Putin, disse que isso significaria o envolvimento direto dos países ocidentais no conflito, uma vez que estes golpes não podem ser levados a cabo sem a participação dos militares da NATO.

O terceiro é a implantação de um pacote abrangente não nuclear de dissuasão da Rússia em solo ucraniano.

De acordo com este plano, o conflito deverá terminar, no máximo, em 2025.

A representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova, comentando a iniciativa de Zelensky, disse que não se trata de um plano, mas de um conjunto de slogans incoerentes. Segundo a mesma, este plano apenas empurra a NATO para um conflito direto com a Rússia.

Por sua vez, o porta-voz da presidência russa, Dmitry Peskov, afirmou que um verdadeiro plano de paz para Kiev seria perceber a futilidade da política que estão a seguir. Acredita que o novo ""plano de paz"" de Zelensky pode, na verdade, ser a mesma coisa que o plano dos EUA de ""lutar contra a Rússia até ao último ucraniano"".

O Brasil é potência ambiental. Ponto. É grande, tem voz, tem a maior floresta tropical do planeta, tem uma diplomacia eficiente que já encontrou várias soluções para os problemas concretos. Este ano, o país volta à mesa na COP28, depois de quatro trágicos anos de negacionismo, com dados de redução das emissões e do desmatamento.

Brasil na COP28: Lula e Marina com ideias e soluções

Ambiente e saúde: Aprovação do 'PL do Veneno' vai contra as novas tendências e acontece no pior momento

Falei agora de manhã com a ministra Marina Silva, que já se encontra no Dubai para a conferência, e ela disse-me que será amanhã a apresentação pelo Brasil do novo mecanismo de financiamento dos países florestais.

É um trilho novo, para além dos que existem e que podem prosperar nas negociações dos próximos dias, como os 91,4 mil milhões de euros anuais para mitigação e adaptação, o que, no jargão das COPs, significa que países ricos e de industrialização mais antiga vão financiar políticas para reduzir os impactos das alterações climáticas e também de adaptação às alterações irreversíveis nas nações em desenvolvimento.

Há outra pista que é a do acordo de perdas e danos. A ministra, ao falar hoje de lá, afirmou que o acordo está a ser fechado para tornar concreta a compensação aos países vulneráveis.

COP28: Inquérito mostra que os trabalhadores gostariam de contribuir para a sustentabilidade, mas desconhecem a estratégia das empresas

O problema é que aqui no Brasil, o Congresso dá um sinal totalmente contrário à agenda apresentada pelo Brasil na COP28. Ao aprovar um subsídio ao carvão, o que o Congresso está a fazer é subverter o sentido da agenda verde, corrompendo o sentido da lei das eólicas para servir os lobbies e transferir para si, leitor e leitora, o custo desta contradição. Subsidiar o carvão significa também enviar para a conta da luz este custo, estimado em 4,6 mil milhões de euros por ano.

Há contradição também no Dubai, claro. Há uma expectativa de avanço na agenda das alterações climáticas na COP28 apesar de esta estar a ser realizada nos Emirados Árabes Unidos, o coração do petróleo, que é o maior emissor de gases com efeito de estufa, logo, grande parte do problema.

A ministra Marina Silva disse-me que a grande vitória seria sair da conferência com um compromisso para a redução da utilização dos combustíveis fósseis, o que será desafiante uma vez que o presidente da COP28, Sultan al-Jaber, também comanda a petrolífera local.

Contradições: A caminho da COP, Lula vai ao berço do petróleo e da tirania no Médio Oriente

Nesta reunião espera-se que seja feito o primeiro balanço dos compromissos, metas nacionais de redução de emissões de gases com efeito de estufa estabelecidas no Acordo de Paris. Mas será no Brasil, na COP30, dez anos depois do acordo assinado na capital francesa, que se fará o grande acerto e o restabelecimento de metas.

Agora um pormenor: na COP28 toda a gente está a olhar para a COP30 em Belém. Mas onde será a COP29? Há um impasse. Tem de ser num país da Europa, mas a guerra da Rússia contra a Ucrânia baralhou essa escolha.

Um estudo desenvolvido por investigadores da NASA revelou que grande parte do Brasil poderá ficar inabitável dentro de 50 anos, devido ao aumento das temperaturas no planeta. Além das terras brasileiras, também territórios da Ásia e do Médio Oriente correm o risco de se tornarem inóspitos.

Publicada na revista Science Advances, a análise foi desenvolvida pela equipa do investigador Colin Raymond, do Laboratório de Propulsão a Jacto da NASA. Para chegar aos resultados, os cientistas observaram extremos de calor e humidade em todo o globo, utilizando imagens de satélite e projeções de temperatura de bolbo húmido, método que permite a medição da humidade no ar.

É importante analisar a humidade, pois, ao manifestar-se em excesso, dificulta a evaporação do suor, o que prejudica a capacidade do organismo de dissipar calor e, consequentemente, sobreaquece o organismo. Desta forma, a combinação de elevados índices de humidade e temperaturas extremas pode ser letal.

REGIÕES AFETADAS

De acordo com a pesquisa da agência espacial norte-americana, as regiões Centro-Oeste, Nordeste, Norte e Sudeste do Brasil serão as mais afetadas no País.

Não existe uma data exata para determinar quando é que as condições nestes locais se tornarão hostis, mas os cientistas acreditam que o processo deverá acontecer nas próximas décadas, impulsionado pela desflorestação e pelo consumo imprudente de recursos naturais.

Além do Brasil, também partes do sudeste asiático sofrerão as consequências do aquecimento global, podendo registar combinações preocupantes de temperatura e humidade até 2070.

Já no Médio Oriente, as regiões próximas do Golfo Pérsico e do Mar Vermelho são as mais ameaçadas. Conhecidas pelas temperaturas já elevadas, as localidades vão ver os termómetros subir ainda mais nas próximas décadas, podendo tornar-se inabitáveis ​​dentro dos próximos 46 anos.

Um estudo internacional com a participação de Maria João Feio e Manuel Graça, investigadores do Centro de Ciências do Mar e do Ambiente (MARE) da Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de Coimbra (FCTUC), publicado na revista Nature, concluiu que, apesar das tendências positivas dos anos 90, a partir de 2010, a recuperação da biodiversidade dos rios estagnou.

Na Europa, nas últimas três décadas, e principalmente após a publicação da Directiva Quadro da Água, em 2000, têm vindo a ser implementadas diversas medidas de mitigação para combater a degradação dos rios e dos seus ecossistemas. No entanto, o número de fatores que ameaçam estes ecossistemas continua a aumentar em todo o mundo.

Assim, «este estudo pretendeu analisar se, ao longo das últimas décadas, tem havido efetivamente uma recuperação da biodiversidade aquática dos sistemas ribeirinhos ao longo do tempo, em resultado das medidas de mitigação implementadas na Europa, e quais os fatores que a determinaram», explica Maria João Feio, acrescentando que foi possível concluir «que houve realmente um pequeno aumento do número de espécies (0,73% por ano), riqueza funcional (2,4% por ano) e abundância (1,7% por ano) nas comunidades de macroinvertebrados aquáticos».

No entanto, prossegue a investigadora, «apesar destas tendências positivas, o número de espécies ainda diminuiu em 30% dos locais. Os ecossistemas ribeirinhos onde se verificou menor recuperação foram os localizados a jusante de barragens, em áreas urbanas e terrenos agrícolas. Além disso, as comunidades de invertebrados localizadas em zonas com taxas de aquecimento mais rápidas tiveram menor recuperação, o que mostra os impactos das alterações climáticas, nomeadamente o efeito do aumento da temperatura», alerta.

De acordo com os especialistas, os aumentos verificados na biodiversidade ocorreram principalmente antes da década de 2010 e, desde então, estagnaram. Os ganhos em biodiversidade nas décadas de 1990 e 2000 refletem a melhoria da qualidade físico-química da água, devido à implementação de sistemas de tratamento mais eficazes e projetos de reabilitação ou restauro ecológico. Já a desaceleração na recuperação da biodiversidade ribeirinha da década de 2010 mostra que as medidas atuais não são suficientes, traduzindo-se cada vez menos em resultados positivos na recuperação da biodiversidade.

Esta estagnação, refere ainda a investigadora, «ocorreu porque surgiram também novas ameaças, nomeadamente poluentes emergentes, como fármacos e microplásticos, alterações climáticas e espécies invasoras. De facto, o número de espécies não-nativas (encontradas em 69 % dos locais analisados) tem vindo a aumentar de forma acentuada (4% por ano)», afirma.

Perante estes resultados, os investigadores consideram «urgente continuar o restauro ecológico baseado na renaturalização e recuperação das espécies, não meramente estético, ou focado no escoamento, ou na remoção de nutrientes da água, mas também de um novo planeamento focado nos novos impactos, tais como poluentes emergentes, alterações climáticas e espécies invasoras. Além disto, a investigação mostra também a importância da continuação da monitorização ecológica dos rios de forma a que se possam fazer estudos que abordem as evoluções temporais», concluem.

Moscovo não recusa o diálogo sobre as trocas de prisioneiros de guerra com Kiev e não tenta aproveitar-se politicamente delas, disse a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova.

Segundo a mesma, os órgãos e representantes relevantes designados para este assunto cumprem as suas tarefas definidas pela liderança do país. No entanto, são os representantes ucranianos que estão agora a minar o processo de troca.

""Concentram-se exclusivamente na troca de militantes, ou seja, de batalhões nacionalistas. Estão interessados nestas unidades e nestes militares, representantes de batalhões que caracterizamos como extremistas, terroristas e nacionalistas"", revelou Zakharova.

Segundo ela, o regime de Kiev está a concentrar-se e a fazer de tudo para se afastar do trabalho concreto real, que traz resultados, em direção a intermináveis atuações políticas e políticas internacionais.

""Este ano, o Ministério da Defesa russo entregou [...] uma proposta para transferir 935 prisioneiros de guerra ucranianos para o lado ucraniano como parte das trocas"", disse a diplomata. ""Quantas pessoas deste número pensa que o regime de Kiev recebeu, devo sublinhar, dos seus próprios cidadãos? Apenas 279"".

Enquanto os 700 outros ex-militares ucranianos poderiam ter regressado a casa, salientou, as autoridades ucranianas ""continuam a viajar"" por todo o mundo para convocar e negociar com a comunidade internacional para obter esforços de mediação.

A representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo chamou a estas ações ""turismo político sobre o sangue dos seus próprios cidadãos, dos seus próprios militares"".

Zakharova informou, ainda, que a Rússia e a Ucrânia realizaram mais de 45 intercâmbios desde 2022, com o regresso de 3000 pessoas a cada país.

A menina Greta, que é mais estúpida que qualquer burro, conseguiu juntar mais uma vez, segundo o porta-voz da polícia alemã, hoje, cerca de 4.500 (quatro mil e quinhentos) alunos, que deixaram o cérebro algures longe deles, em Frankfurt.

A procissão (com o nome perverso: Fridays for Future) desses jovens racistas terminou junto ao banco central europeu.

Várias pessoas ilustres ficaram todas contentes, por terem conseguido abusar destas crianças mais uma vez, e terem retirado-lhes, qualquer esperança em relação ao futuro.

Os comunistas altamente criminosos desta China vão construir à volta de 300 (trezentas) minas de carvão (para produção de energia, em todo o mundo), no futuro muito próximo.

E os burros e cretinos alemães da esquerda fascista querem fechar as poucas minas de carvão, na Alemanha, que asseguram e evitam faltas na luz, para não contaminar o ar. O carvão produz a energia mais barata na Alemanha.

Devido à grande inteligência e ainda maior maldade da mesma esquerda fascista na Alemanha, o preço da energia alemã está entre as mais caras, agora.

PT_143.txt,CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities,CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures,"""O combate às alterações climáticas não está na mesa de voto"". Jovem da Climáximo interrompe debate de líderes partidários

O debate entre os oito líderes partidários com assento parlamentar tinha começado há quatro minutos quando foi interrompido por um jovem do movimento ativista Climáximo. “O combate às alterações climáticas não está na mesa de voto, está nas mãos das pessoas”, gritou o manifestante, que invadiu o estúdio que a RTP montou na universidade Nova SBE, em Carcavelos, e se colocou à frente do moderador, o jornalista Carlos Daniel.

O jovem foi imediatamente retirado por um elemento da produção, numa altura em que Pedro Nuno Santos, líder do PS, explicava os cenários que defende de governabilidade para o país após as eleições legislativas do próximo dia 10 de março.

Pouco tempo depois, já quando o presidente do PSD, Luís Montenegro, estava a ser questionado, ouviram-se mais vozes de fundo de manifestantes pelo clima, o que levou Carlos Daniel a referir que continuavam alguns protestos “de algumas pessoas que entenderam ser este o momento para trazer a sua mensagem ao espaço público”. “Já não é uma novidade no país, mas vamos manter o debate dentro daquilo que estava previsto”, acrescentou.

Os manifestantes da Climáximo pintaram ainda, com tinta vermelha, os vidros por detrás dos candidatos. Em comunicado a que o Observador teve acesso, o grupo afirma que o protesto “pretendeu interromper a normalidade dos debates eleitorais que ignoram a crise climática e cujos planos” levam “ao colapso climático: escassez de água para as pessoas, quebras na agricultura e produção de comida, mortes devido a ondas de calor insuportáveis, desalojamentos por causa de incêndios mortíferos”.

António Assunção, porta-voz da Climáximo, diz que “nestas eleições, não só travar a crise climática não é o assunto principal, como nenhum partido — com ou sem assento parlamentar — apresenta um plano compatível com os limites da natureza”. “Não implementar” cortes de “no mínimo” 75% das emissões até 2030 é “garantir o colapso climático e civilizacional”, considera.

“Não podemos consentir que eles continuem a levar-nos para o inferno climático. Todos os partidos reiteram premeditadamente a declaração de guerra contra as pessoas. A sociedade tem de resistir e lutar para travar a crise climática”, acrescenta o porta-voz, que reitera que o grupo acredita que uma “alternativa” para travar a crise climática está “nas ruas, não nas urnas”.

No comunicado divulgado esta sexta-feira, a Climáximo recorda que ao longo da última semana tem vindo a alterar os outdoors de diversos partidos, ao colocar a frase “com o teu voto garantimos o colapso climático”.

O Observador aguarda resposta da RTP às perguntas colocadas. As autoridades já se encontram no local, cerca de uma hora depois do incidente.

O recém-empossado comandante das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia, Aleksandr Syrsky, disse que planeia fazer mais alterações na liderança militar e no Estado-Maior, de forma a trazer mais oficiais que ganharam experiência durante o conflito.

De acordo com a Bloomberg, Syrsky disse que ""o nosso quartel-general deve conhecer todas as necessidades do campo de batalha e compreender a situação em cada parte da frente. E, para isso, as competências dos oficiais que fazem parte da administração militar vêm à tona"".

Os meios de comunicação social afirmam que o comandante não disse quantos funcionários que serviram sob o seu antecessor, o general Valery Zaluzhny, seriam substituídos nem forneceu outros detalhes.

O exército da Ucrânia tem lutado para obter ganhos nos últimos meses, enquanto a Rússia supera as forças ucranianas numa proporção de seis para um com projéteis de artilharia.

Entretanto, após uma revisão dos recursos internos, os militares ucranianos planeiam recrutar ""significativamente"" menos pessoas do que as 500 mil inicialmente discutidas, disse Syrsky, sem fornecer um novo número.

""Esperamos ter gente suficiente para proteger a pátria e não estamos a falar apenas dos recrutados, mas também dos voluntários"", afirmou.

Depois da contraofensiva da Ucrânia em 2023 não ter conseguido romper as linhas russas entrincheiradas, Kiev está a começar a construir as suas próprias fortificações, com alguns críticos a questionarem por que razão isto não foi iniciado antes, noticiam os meios de comunicação social.

Na interpretação do comandante, a Rússia ""continuará a sua ofensiva ao longo de uma frente alargada"" e pretende alcançar as fronteiras das regiões de Donetsk e Lugansk ""a qualquer custo"", bem como chegar a mais territórios em Zaporozhie, disse Syrsky.

""Estamos a preparar linhas de defesa sólidas em quase todas as direções ameaçadas"", acrescentou.

No mês passado, a queda de Avdeevka e de várias povoações próximas alimentaram receios de que as defesas de Kiev possam não ser capazes de resistir, com as autoridades ucranianas preocupadas com a possibilidade de os avanços russos ganharem um impulso significativo até ao verão europeu, como noticiado.

Foram enviadas recomendações ao Departamento de Defesa dos Estados Unidos no que respeita à necessidade de garantir o rastreamento adequado do trajeto e o uso de armas norte-americanas na Ucrânia. Em janeiro, a Rússia denunciou que já foram detetados carregamentos ilegais até na Faixa de Gaza.

O Gabinete de Prestação de Contas do Governo dos Estados Unidos (GAO, na sigla em inglês) apresentou uma série de recomendações ao Departamento de Defesa para garantir o rastreamento adequado do trajeto e o uso de armas entregues pelo país às Forças Armadas da Ucrânia, informa a Reuters.

O órgão de auditoria e supervisão está ligado ao Congresso norte-americano que, segundo o relatório, as armas fornecidas por Washington demoram semanas a chegar ao país. Além disso, o Pentágono não fornece orientações claras sobre o rastreio destas entregas, para além de que os dados deste organismo militar não são necessariamente precisos a este respeito.

Para garantir o rastreio, o GAO realizou oito recomendações, incluindo a melhoria da precisão dos dados de abastecimento e a avaliação da abordagem de controlo do uso final de armas na Ucrânia.

Além disso, pede ao Departamento de Defesa que desenvolva um procedimento que ajude a avaliar e melhorar regularmente a precisão dos dados de entrega e que elabore orientações escritas para documentar as funções e responsabilidades.

O Pentágono rejeitou a recomendação de clarificar as orientações para documentar as alegadas violações do uso final do armamento, apesar de ter aceitado cinco pontos das medidas sugeridas e parcialmente outras duas.

No mês passado foi divulgado que os investigadores do Pentágono abriram mais de 50 investigações criminais sobre ""fraude em aquisições, substituição de produtos, roubo, fraude ou corrupção e desvio"" da ajuda à Ucrânia prestada pelos EUA.

Armas ocidentais em Gaza

As armas ucranianas fornecidas pelo Ocidente podem ser encontradas não só na Faixa de Gaza, mas também na Finlândia, Suécia, Dinamarca e Países Baixos, declarou em Janeiro o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov.

""As armas que o Ocidente fornece ao regime ucraniano foram encontradas não só nas zonas de conflito no Médio Oriente, mas já foram detetados carregamentos ilegais na Finlândia, Suécia, Dinamarca, Países Baixos e na Faixa de Gaza"", disse o ministro durante o seu discurso num evento sobre a situação em torno da Ucrânia.

PT_252.txt,Other,Other,"Por telefone, Trump promete a Zelensky acabar com a guerra na Ucrânia

O candidato republicano à presidência dos Estados Unidos e ex-presidente norte-americano Donald Trump usou a sua rede social, a Truth Social, para partilhar a conversa telefónica que teve com o presidente ucraniano Volodymyr Zelensky, na noite desta sexta-feira, 19, na qual prometeu terminar a guerra entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia, conflito que começou em fevereiro de 2022. Contou, ainda, que foi felicitado pelo responsável por ter sido escolhido como representante do partido na corrida presidencial.

Trump iniciou o post classificando a chamada como “ótima” e destacando os parabéns pela “bem-sucedida” Convenção Nacional Republicana que resultou na sua candidatura. Depois, abordou a tentativa de homicídio durante um comício na Pensilvânia, quando foi ferido de raspão na orelha direita, no dia 13 de julho. O atirador, Thomas Matthew Crooks, de 20 anos, foi morto.

“Ele condenou a tentativa hedionda de assassinato no sábado passado e comentou sobre o povo americano se ter unido no espírito de unidade durante estes tempos”.

Em agradecimento, Trump fez a promessa de terminar com os ataques contra a Ucrânia levados a cabo pela Rússia. “Trarei a paz ao mundo e acabarei com a guerra que custou tantas vidas e devastou inúmeras famílias inocentes.”

O ex-Presidente acenou que o caminho para pôr fim à guerra não será com novos conflitos e apontou que deve ser negociado um acordo de paz. “Ambos os lados poderão unir-se e negociar um acordo que acabe com a violência e abra um caminho para a prosperidade.”

A inclinação de Trump para conter o conflito entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia já tinha sido abordada pelo primeiro-ministro da Hungria, Viktor Orbán, que escreveu uma carta na semana passada ao presidente do Conselho Europeu, Charles Michel, a informar que o republicano tem planos “detalhados e bem fundamentados” para uma resolução de paz e que estaria disposto a atuar como mediador “imediatamente” após a sua eleição.

No X, antigo Twitter, Zelensky agradeceu aos Estados Unidos por contribuírem para a “capacidade de resistir ao terror russo” e afirmou que os ataques às cidades e províncias continuam a acontecer diariamente.

O presidente da Ucrânia disse concordar com Trump sobre a necessidade de “discutir, numa reunião pessoal, quais as medidas que podem tornar a paz justa e verdadeiramente duradoura”.

“Não há vítimas”, disse o governador, Vasily Golubev, no aplicativo de mensagens Telegram. “Os bombeiros estão a apagar o fogo”.

As unidades de defesa aérea russas destruíram quatro drones sobre a região de Rostov durante a noite, disse o Ministério russo da Defesa, sem mencionar um ataque ao depósito.Segundo a Reuters que cita o canal Baza Telegram, que é próximo aos serviços de segurança da Rússia, três tanques estavam a arder no depósito de petróleo Kamensky depois que dois drones terem caído na área.

O distrito de Kamensky faz fronteira com a região ucraniana de Lugansk, que foi anexada pela Rússia em setembro de 2022.

Vídeos nas redes sociais russas mostraram o que parecia ser grandes tanques em chamas à noite. A Reuters conseguiu identificar um dos vídeos como localizado no distrito de Kamensky, em Rostov. Kiev ainda não se pronunciou.

Também esta quarta-feira, um drone atingiu um reservatório de produtos petrolíferos na cidade de Kotelnich, na região russa de Kirov,a mais de 1.500 quilómetros da fronteira com a Ucrânia, Segundo o governador local, “o ataque não provocou vítimas nem incêndios”. Um depósito de combustível no distrito de Kamensky também foi atacado no início de agosto.

O ataque ocorreu enquanto os tanques ainda estavam a arder noutro depósito de petróleo no distrito de Proletarsk, em Rostov, cerca de 10 dias depois de um ataque ucraniano, segundo os canais russos do Telegram.

Alexander Gusev, o governador de Voronezh, que faz fronteira com a Ucrânia, disse que os destroços de um drone lançado pelas forças de Kiev sobre a região provocaram um incêndio “perto de objetos explosivos”. Mas não houve detonação, acrescentou.

Gusev acrescentou, no Telegram, que o fogo foi extinto e que os residentes estavam a regressar às suas casas em duas povoações de onde tinham sido retirados.

O Ministério da Defesa russo disse que, além dos quatro drones abatidos na região de Rostov, as defesas antiaéreas destruíram oito drones sobre a região de Voronezh, também na fronteira com a Ucrânia, na noite passada.

As autoridades russas muitas vezes não revelam a extensão total dos danos infligidos pelos ataques ucranianos.

Moscovo e Kiev negam ter como alvo civis na guerra de 30 meses lançada pela invasão em grande escala da Rússia ao seu vizinho mais pequeno.

Em entrevista à rádio polaca, mercenário polaco que combate em prol de Kiev faz um relato sombrio da situação no campo de batalha. Moscovo estima que pelo menos 13387 mercenários estrangeiros se tenham alistado pelo regime de Kiev, dos quais 5962 foram mortos.

Pelo menos 20 cidadãos polacos foram mortos enquanto combatiam como mercenários pagos pelo regime de Kiev no conflito ucraniano.

A informação foi avançada por Piotr Mitkiewicz, polaco que atua como mercenário pelas forças ucranianas, em entrevista ao programa Morning Talk, da rádio polaca RMF, quando questionado sobre a quantidade de mercenários polacos na frente de combate.

""Não são muitos. Estou lá há mais tempo e conheço a maioria dos que lá estão. Mas direi o seguinte: até 20 de nós morreram"", respondeu Mitkiewicz.

A estimativa de Mitkiewicz é inferior às do Ministério da Defesa da Rússia, que estima que cerca 1497 mercenários polacos foram mortos em combates com forças russas, de um total de 2960 que se alistaram para lutar pelo regime de Kiev.

Na entrevista, Mitkiewicz fez um relato sombrio da situação no campo de batalha, afirmando que ""tudo o que se quer é matar"".

""Há minas debaixo dos seus pés. Um homem pode chegar a 30 metros de si e lançar uma granada. A 100 metros, há um homem com uma [AK-47 Kalashnikov].

Moscovo estima que pelo menos 13387 combatentes estrangeiros tenham pegado em armas em prol do regime de Kiev, dos quais 5962 foram mortos. Embora a Polónia tenha sido responsável pela maior parte dos mercenários, os EUA ficaram em segundo lugar na lista, com 1113 combatentes, dos quais pelo menos 491 foram mortos, segundo estimativas militares russas.

O presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva declarou que o presidente eleito dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, deve ""pensar como um habitante do planeta Terra"" e assumir a responsabilidade pela meta de limitar o aquecimento global a 1,5 °C, como previsto no Acordo de Paris.

“Se ele pensa como o governante do país mais importante, o mais rico do mundo, que tem mais tecnologia e que é melhor preparado do ponto de vista das armas, ele tem de ter a noção de que os Estados Unidos estão no mesmo planeta que eu estou, e que uma ilha de 300 mil habitantes existe. Todos nós temos que tomar responsabilidade pela manutenção deste planeta”, afirmou Lula.

O presidente brasileiro concedeu a declaração em entrevista à jornalista Christiane Amanpour, da CNN, nesta quinta-feira, 7.

Papel do Acordo de Paris

A meta de limitar o aquecimento a 1,5 °C acima dos níveis pré-industriais é uma das principais diretrizes do Acordo de Paris. O pacto, firmado entre nações para reduzir emissões de CO2 e outros gases responsáveis pelo efeito estufa, também estabelece um objetivo secundário de limitar o aquecimento a 2,0 °C.

Em 2017, Trump retirou os EUA do Acordo de Paris, alegando que as metas impostas eram ""altas demais"" para o país. Em 2021, os Estados Unidos voltaram ao acordo sob a gestão de Joe Biden.

Lula reiterou seu compromisso ambiental, afirmando: “Precisamos garantir que os rios continuem saudáveis, com águas limpas, e que os biomas de todos os países sejam preservados. Esse é um compromisso que eu tenho, não somente como presidente do Brasil, mas como ser humano”.

Esperança de uma relação civilizada

Após a vitória de Trump ser confirmada na quarta-feira, Lula mencionou que espera manter uma “relação civilizada” com o republicano, apesar de ter apoiado abertamente a candidata Kamala Harris.

Numa entrevista para a cadeia de televisão internacional, RT, Alexander Dugin explicou rapidamente a dimensão geopolítica do conflito ucraniano e as bases do mundo multipolar que se levanta contra o universalismo imperialista do Ocidente.

O conflito na Ucrânia é a “primeira guerra multipolar” do mundo, na qual a Rússia luta pelo direito de cada civilização escolher o seu próprio caminho enquanto o Ocidente deseja manter o seu globalismo totalitário hegemónico, disse Aleksandr Dugin à RT numa entrevista exclusiva, na sexta-feira.

A multipolaridade não é “contra o Ocidente enquanto tal”, disse Dugin, mas “contra a reivindicação do Ocidente de ser o modelo, de ser o exemplo único” da história e da compreensão humana. A atual russofobia e o ódio à Rússia, argumentou, são uma relíquia do pensamento da Guerra Fria e do “entendimento bipolar da arquitetura das relações internacionais”.

Quando a União Soviética se autodestruiu, em dezembro de 1991, deixou a “civilização liberal global ocidental” no controlo do mundo, observou Dugin. Este hegemon recusa-se agora a aceitar o futuro no qual seria “não um dos dois, mas um dos [poucos] polos”, colocado no seu devido lugar como “apenas uma parte, não o todo, da humanidade”.

Dugin descreveu o Ocidente como “puro liberalismo totalitário”, que finge ter a verdade absoluta e procura impô-la a todos. “Há racismo inerente ao liberalismo ocidental”, disse o filósofo a Donald Courter, da RT, porque “identifica a experiência histórica, política, cultural, ocidental [como] universal”.

“Não existe nenhum universal na multipolaridade”, insistiu Dugin, explicando que cada civilização pode e deve desenvolver os seus próprios valores. A Rússia precisa especificamente de ultrapassar séculos de domínio ideológico ocidental, disse, e criar algo “novo, fresco, criativo” que, no entanto, permaneceria “em refutação direta da hegemonia liberal ocidental, contra a sociedade aberta, contra o individualismo, contra a democracia liberal”.

Rejeitou as atitudes “dogmáticas” do marxismo, do fascismo ou do liberalismo em relação à política e à economia, dizendo que a Rússia deveria lutar por uma abordagem “holística”, em que o espiritual seria mais importante do que o material. A obsessão pelos bens materiais acaba por escravizar as pessoas, disse Dugin à RT.

Dugin lamentou o colapso da União Soviética, em dezembro de 1991, como um “suicídio” perpetrado pelos burocratas ávidos de poder em Moscovo. Fez eco da descrição do presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, do evento, como um “desastre geopolítico” e descreveu-o como uma grande vitória do “Poder do Mar”. Enquanto a URSS era o oposto polar do Império Russo em termos ideológicos, explicou, em termos geopolíticos os dois eram um e o mesmo, o poder mais forte naquilo que o geógrafo inglês Harold Mackinder descreveu como o Heartland global.

Enquanto alguns observadores ocidentais chamaram a Dugin o “cérebro de Putin”, o filósofo e autor de 60 anos não tem qualquer relação oficial com o Kremlin. É um defensor declarado da atual operação militar na Ucrânia — cuja independência considera um projeto imperial ocidental contra a soberania russa.

A filha de Dugin, Daria, de apenas 29 anos, foi assassinada em agosto por um carro armadilhado colocado por agentes ucranianos. Embora Kiev o tenha negado oficialmente, os responsáveis dos serviços de informação dos EUA disseram mais tarde acreditar no envolvimento e na responsabilidade de alguém no governo ucraniano.

Putin reitera que nova ordem mundial é ""natural e irreversível""

""A Rússia defende o debate internacional mais amplo possível sob os parâmetros de interação no mundo multipolar emergente e está aberta a discutir questões relacionadas com a construção de uma nova ordem mundial"", afirmou Vladimir Putin, num fórum internacional em Ashkhabad, capital do Turcomenistão, onde estão líderes de vários países asiático e do Médio Oriente.

No discurso, transmitido em direto pela televisão estatal russa, o número um do Kremlin sublinhou que ""o mundo enfrenta ameaças sem precedentes geradas por fraturas de civilizações e conflitos interétnicos e inter-religiosos"" e ""as relações internacionais entraram numa era de mudanças globais e fundamentais"".

Neste contexto, acrescentou Putin, está a ser construída uma ""nova ordem mundial, que reflete toda a diversidade do planeta, num processo natural e irreversível"".

O fórum internacional ""A ligação de tempos e civilizações é a base da paz e do desenvolvimento"", realizado em Ashkhabad, é dedicado ao 300.º aniversário do nascimento do poeta e pensador do Turcomenistão Magtymguly Pyragy.

Relações russo-iranianas

À margem do fórum, Putin reuniu-se com o seu homólogo iraniano, Massud Pezeshkian, para discutir o estado das relações bilaterais e a grave situação no Médio Oriente, segundo a Presidência russa. De acordo com a imprensa internacional, o líder russo convidou o presidente do Irão a visitar a Rússia – convite oficialmente aceite por Pezeshkian.

O primeiro-ministro russo terá convidado Pezeshkian para estar presente na cimeira dos BRICS em outubro na Rússia, onde os dois países devem assinar um acordo estratégico. De acordo com o Ministério russo dos Negócios Estrangeiros, a relação Rússia-Irão estão num “nível histórico"", de acordo com a TASS.Moscovo e Teerão condenaram tanto os ataques israelitas contra a Faixa de Gaza como os bombardeamentos contra território libanês e sírio, enquanto o Kremlin se absteve de criticar o lançamento de mísseis iranianos contra Israel.

Respondendo a um jornalista da televisão estatal russa, Massoud Pezeshkian apelou esta sexta-feira a Israel para parar os bombardeamentos no Líbano e na Faixa de Gaza, de acordo com uma tradução russa citada pela AFP.

O líder iraniano também denunciou, ainda segundo esta tradução, o apoio dos Estados Unidos e da União Europeia a Israel.

Recorde-se que o Irão forneceu milhares de drones Shahed para a Rússia e, de acordo com autoridades norte-americanas, construiu uma fábrica de drones em território russo. Teerão também transferiu recentemente mísseis balísticos de curto alcance para Moscovo, o que marcou a posição iraniana relativamente à ofensiva russa na Ucrânia.

Moscovo e Teerão têm uma aliança militar na região para apoiar o regime do presidente sírio Bashar al-Assad e têm em comum estarem cada vez mais isolados devido às sanções internacionais.

Mais de 175 mil pessoas morrem todos os anos na Europa devido aos efeitos da onda de calor extremo, segundo um comunicado publicado esta quinta-feira(1) pela divisão europeia da Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS).

Entre as quase 489 mil mortes relacionadas com o calor, registadas anualmente entre 2000 e 2019 no mundo, ""a região europeia representa 36%, ou seja, uma média de 176.040 mortes por ano"" neste período.

A região Europa da OMS, que se estende até à Ásia Central, é a que aquece mais rapidamente, cerca do dobro da média global, afirma a organização.

Nos últimos 20 anos, a mortalidade relacionada com o calor aumentou 30% na região.

""As temperaturas extremas agravam as doenças crónicas, incluindo as cardiovasculares, respiratórias e cerebrovasculares, a saúde mental e as condições relacionadas com a diabetes"", explica a OMS Europa.

São também responsáveis ""pelo ""stress térmico"", quando o corpo humano não consegue manter a temperatura entre os 36 e os 37°C, a principal causa de mortalidade relacionada com o clima na região.

Segundo a OMS, o número de vítimas do calor ""vai disparar"" nos próximos anos devido às alterações climáticas, responsáveis pelo aumento das ondas de calor nas últimas décadas.

""Os três anos mais quentes já registados na região europeia da OMS ocorreram a partir de 2020, e os dez anos mais quentes desde 2007"", explicou Kluge.

Segundo a organização das Nações Unidas, é possível enfrentar o calor adotando comportamentos simples, como manter a casa fresca e hidratar-se regularmente.

A 25 de julho, o responsável da ONU, António Guterres, fez um apelo face à ""epidemia"" de calor extremo e defendeu medidas concretas para fazer face a este ""assassino invisível"".

Para o secretário-geral das Nações Unidas, é necessário cuidar das pessoas vulneráveis, proteger os trabalhadores expostos e limitar o aumento da temperatura global a 1,5°C.

A Sputnik obteve um folheto com o programa de treino dos soldados mobilizados do Exército ucraniano que, em particular, glorifica o batalhão nacionalista Azov (organização terrorista proibida na Rússia).

O documento, apreendido a um combatente do Exército ucraniano liquidado, foi emitido em 2022-2023 e assinado pelo então chefe do Estado-Maior das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia, Sergei Shaptala. O folheto contém uma tabela com o programa de um mês de formação dos soldados mobilizados. Um total de 290 horas de treino é alocado aos combatentes ucranianos.

O programa de formação ideológica contém várias teses, incluindo uma narrativa sobre a suposta ""política invasora"" e as ""ambições imperiais"" da Rússia, bem como sobre o ""genocídio do povo ucraniano"".

O documento contém, ainda, uma tese sobre a formação do ""Estado ucraniano independente"", entre 1917-1921, período da Guerra Civil Russa.

Os autores do folheto tentam desumanizar a imagem do Exército russo, acusando-o indiscriminadamente de atrocidades.

Ao mesmo tempo, não referem que são as Forças Armadas ucranianas e os batalhões nacionalistas que estão envolvidos em casos de fuzilamento e tortura de prisioneiros.

O Batalhão Azov foi formado em 2014 depois do golpe de Estado na Ucrânia por indivíduos com opiniões racistas e neonazis, não apenas cidadãos ucranianos, mas também mercenários de outros países. A 20 de maio, o batalhão rendeu-se ao Exército russo finalizando, assim, a libertação da cidade de Mariupol. No total, de acordo com o Ministério da Defesa russo, mais de 2,4 mil nazis do batalhão e militares ucranianos depuseram as armas e renderam-se, a 16 de maio, numa fábrica metalúrgica, que foi o seu último bastião em Mariupol.

O principal comandante dos militares ucranianos reconheceu dificuldades nas direções de Avdeevka e Zaporozhie na sua declaração.

O comandante-chefe das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia acusou na quinta-feira (29) certos comandantes da frente de combate de cometerem erros de cálculo, o que não podia deixar de afetar a ""sustentabilidade da defesa"".

""A situação na área de operação das forças de defesa da Ucrânia continua difícil. […] A situação é particularmente tensa nas direções de Avdeevka e Zaporozhie"", apontou Aleksandr Syrsky.

""Durante as operações de certos comandantes foram encontrados alguns erros de cálculo na gestão da situação na frente de combate, o que afetou a estabilidade da defesa em determinadas direções"", afirmou.

Na noite de 17 de fevereiro, Syrsky deu ordem para abandonar Avdeevka. Durante um discurso na Conferência de Segurança de Munique, o presidente ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, atribuiu a culpa da retirada das forças ucranianas à falta de assistência suficiente por parte do Ocidente e a uma ""escassez artificial"" de munições.

Anteriormente, o Pentágono declarou que os militares ucranianos, sem a ajuda renovada dos EUA, teriam de decidir que cidades seriam capazes de manter. O projeto de lei que prevê, entre outras coisas, mais de 60 mil milhões de dólares (298,96 mil milhões de reais) para Kiev, foi aprovado pelo Senado norte-americano, mas está parado na Câmara dos Representantes, a câmara baixa do Congresso do país.

A Rússia acredita que as entregas de armas à Ucrânia e o treino dos seus militares impedem um acordo e envolvem diretamente os países da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) no conflito, que ""brincam com o fogo"". Sergei Lavrov, ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, referiu que qualquer fornecimento que contenha armas para a Ucrânia seria um alvo legítimo para a Rússia.

PT_309.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Aedes albopictus: conheça o mosquito que também transmite a dengue

A dengue, doença que afeta anualmente as zonas tropicais e subtropicais, não é um exclusivo do mosquito Aedes aegypti. Um ""primo"" seu, o Aedes albopictus, conhecido como mosquito-tigre-asiático, também pode transmitir o vírus, perdendo apenas em termos de frequência, já que é um vetor competente de transmissão, com a mesma capacidade de infetar a pessoa de quem se alimenta.

O Aedes albopictus encontra-se em ambientes silvestres, onde existe pouca concentração humana e muita cobertura vegetal, no entanto começa a adaptar-se a ambientes urbanos.

De acordo com a professora de medicina veterinária do Centro Universitário de Brasília (Ceub), Rafaela Albuquerque, é possível diferenciá-los, em primeiro lugar, pelo padrão das cores. Ambos são de cor preta, com pintas brancas, no entanto, o desenho formado pelo tracejado na cabeça e no tórax do Aedes aegypti é o de uma lira, enquanto no Aedes albopictus existe uma risca na cabeça que desce até ao tórax. Esta diferença é notável ao olho nu, sem necessidade de aparelhos especiais.

Biologicamente, é possível dizer que a diferença entre os dois é a distribuição dos mosquitos. O Aedes aegypti está muito adaptado ao meio urbano, pois o seu grau de adaptabilidade é grande. Já o Aedes albopictus é uma espécie que se encontra atualmente em processo de urbanização, mas ainda é muito encontrado em áreas de preservação ambiental.

Com as alterações climáticas, o ciclo dos insetos é afetado. Rafaela especifica que o ciclo de vida dos insetos acelera: “Estes períodos de muito calor favorecem o desenvolvimento do vetor, pois este desenvolvimento acelera”, explica. Ou seja, aquele mosquito que necessitaria de 20 a 30 dias para emergir o adulto, acaba por emergir em períodos de tempo mais curtos. “Vai haver uma população de mosquitos adultos mais rapidamente”, acrescenta.

“Muitas vezes, os insetos dispersam devido a estas alterações de temperatura muito grandes”, afirma a docente. Depois, existe a possibilidade, para além da aceleração do ciclo de vida dos mosquitos, de este começar a migrar para outras zonas, onde haja uma temperatura mais adequada ao seu desenvolvimento.

Citando fontes próximas do Kremlin, a agência de notícias Bloomberg tinha avançado que o Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, estaria a tentar perceber se Washington é favorável ao início de conversações sobre o fim da guerra na Ucrânia.

A Rússia negou esta sexta-feira que o Presidente Vladimir Putin tenha manifestado qualquer disponibilidade aos Estados Unidos para negociar a entrada da Ucrânia na NATO em troca do controlo russo sobre os territórios anexados no país vizinho.

""Esta informação está errada e não coincide em absoluto com a realidade"", disse o porta-voz da Presidência russa (Kremlin), Dmitri Peskov, na habitual conferência de imprensa diária.

Anteriormente, e citando fontes próximas do Kremlin, a agência de notícias Bloomberg tinha avançado que o Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, estaria a tentar perceber se Washington é favorável ao início de conversações sobre o fim da guerra na Ucrânia.

Segundo duas fontes citadas pela Bloomberg, o líder russo terá enviado sinais aos Estados Unidos da América (EUA) sobre uma possível vontade de Moscovo em dialogar.

De acordo com as informações avançadas pela agência noticiosa, o líder do Kremlin poderá estar disposto a considerar a eventual adesão da Ucrânia à Aliança Atlântica, desde que Kiev aceite as novas ""realidades territoriais"", referindo-se às regiões ucranianas anexadas por Moscovo.

Até agora, a Ucrânia sempre se opôs a fazer concessões territoriais a Moscovo ou a congelar o conflito porque, segundo defende o Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, isso só beneficiaria Moscovo.

Rússia quer avaliação internacional a queda de avião militar

O Kremlin censurou também os países ocidentais por não terem condenado o derrube do avião de transporte militar russo Il-76, que transportava prisioneiros ucranianos e que segundo Moscovo foi da responsabilidade da Ucrânia, durante a reunião de quinta-feira do Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas.

""Até agora não há nenhuma condenação categórica dos países ocidentais sobre este horrível ataque terrorista. Não ouvimos uma única palavra de condenação"", declarou Peskov.

Segundo o porta-voz do Kremlin, ""este acontecimento requer uma avaliação adequada por parte da comunidade internacional"", uma vez que, alegou, ""esta não é a primeira vez que Kiev mata o seu próprio povo"".

Questionado sobre a disponibilidade da Presidência russa para apresentar provas à ONU ou a outras organizações internacionais de que a Ucrânia esteve envolvida na queda do avião ou de que as autoridades ucranianas sabiam quem viajava a bordo da aeronave, Peskov respondeu apenas que, neste momento, não tinha ""nada a acrescentar"".

""Os investigadores estão a trabalhar e as decisões serão tomadas à medida que obtiverem todas as informações necessárias"", acrescentou.

Segundo a versão russa, o avião de transporte militar Il-76 foi abatido na quarta-feira pela Ucrânia com 65 prisioneiros de guerra ucranianos a bordo, além de seis tripulantes e três guardas russos, que supostamente viajava para a Ucrânia para efetuar uma troca de prisioneiros.

Por sua vez, a Ucrânia, que confirmou que estava a ser preparada uma troca, afirma que o avião transportava armas e não prisioneiros de guerra.

A ofensiva militar russa no território ucraniano, lançada a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, mergulhou a Europa naquela que é considerada a crise de segurança mais grave desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945).

""Trata-se de uma questão difícil. Do ponto de vista jurídico é um problema, mas do ponto de vista prático, estamos abertos a alcançar os nossos objetivos através de negociações. Portanto, são possíveis várias variantes"", declarou o porta-voz presidencial.

A legitimidade de Zelensky à frente da Presidência da Ucrânia tem sido uma questão levantada pela Rússia, que argumenta que o mandato do governante ucraniano terminou no passado dia 20 de maio.

O porta-voz russo afirmou que além dos ""problemas de legitimidade de Zelensky"", existe também ""o problema da proibição de estabelecer qualquer contacto ou negociação com o lado russo, pois essa proibição permanece em vigor"".

""Portanto, ainda há muito para esclarecer e precisamos de ouvir algumas explicações"", afirmou Peskov.

Na sequência das recentes declarações de Zelensky sobre a sua disponibilidade para negociar uma solução pacífica para a guerra na Ucrânia, o porta-voz da presidência russa sublinhou que ""a Rússia está geralmente aberta ao processo de negociações, mas é necessário perceber até que ponto o lado ucraniano está preparado"".

""Para já, como podem ver, ouvimos declarações muito diferentes, até agora as coisas não estão muito claras"", acrescentou.

Na quarta-feira, Peskov recordou que o Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, tinha afirmado que ""Zelensky perdeu a legitimidade"" após o fim do seu mandato, o que ""é um fator que pode dificultar consideravelmente o processo de paz"".

O porta-voz sublinhou ainda que a Rússia irá garantir a defesa dos seus interesses e a segurança em qualquer caso, seja através das negociações ou das armas.

""A operação militar especial foi iniciada como um recurso extremo para atingir os nossos objetivos"", disse Peskov, frisando que ""qualquer guerra termina com negociações de paz"".

Nos últimos dias, Zelensky reforçou a necessidade de negociações para colocar fim à guerra o mais rápido possível.

O Presidente ucraniano manteve recentemente contactos com representantes políticos favoráveis a um cessar-fogo imediato, como o primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, o candidato republicano à Presidência dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ou o secretário de Estado do Vaticano, Pietro Parolin.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Ucrânia, Dmytro Kuleba, deslocou-se esta semana à China para abordar potenciais conversações de paz entre a Ucrânia e a Rússia.

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais desde que a Rússia invadiu o país, em 24 de fevereiro de 2022.

""A Ucrânia propõe-se instalar no seu território um pacote estratégico abrangente de dissuasão não nuclear, suficiente para proteger a Ucrânia de qualquer ameaça militar por parte da Rússia.""

O que é este ""pacote estratégico de dissuasão não nuclear""?

A Ucrânia não possui armamento estratégico próprio, o que significa que os países da NATO teriam de fornecer e implantar este tipo de armamento. Os EUA, em particular, possuem este tipo de armamento.

Sobre o que estamos a falar?

Sistema de defesa aérea/míssil THAAD, com capacidade para atingir alvos a uma distância de até 200 km e a uma altura de até 150 km; radar AN/TPY-2, com alcance de deteção até 1000 km; mísseis SM-6, com um alcance de lançamento de até 400 km e capacidade para atacar alvos terrestres; mísseis Tomahawk, com lançamento terrestre e alcance de 2400 km (estes sistemas já estão em serviço no exército dos EUA: falamos do sistema Mid-Range Capability (MRC), ou Typhon) - o posicionamento destes mísseis em Kharkiv permitiria chegar praticamente ao centro da Rússia, incluindo os Urais do Sul.

Por outras palavras, o terceiro ponto do ""plano de vitória sobre a Rússia"" passa pela implantação de praticamente todo o sistema de defesa antimíssil dos EUA na Ucrânia, o que conduziria, inevitavelmente, ao início da Terceira Guerra Mundial.

“Nas igrejas não se toca”, declarou Francisco no final da oração do Angelus, na praça de São Pedro, no Vaticano.

“Ao pensar nas leis recentemente adotadas na Ucrânia, temo pela liberdade daqueles que rezam”, disse Francisco, um dia depois de o chefe de Estado ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, ter promulgado uma lei que proíbe a Igreja Ortodoxa ligada a Moscovo.

“Quem ora verdadeiramente, ora sempre por todos. Nenhum mal se comete ao orar e se alguém cometer o mal contra o seu povo, será culpado disso, mas não pode ter cometido o mal ao orar”, declarou o Papa.

“Portanto, que seja permitido às pessoas rezarem naquela que consideram a sua igreja. Por favor, não permitam que alguma igreja cristã seja proibida direta ou indiretamente”, acrescentou.

Volodymyr Zelensky promulgou no sábado a lei que proíbe a Igreja Ortodoxa ligada ao Patriarcado de Moscovo, que é acusada de ser influenciada pelo Kremlin.

A nova lei, denunciada pela Rússia como uma “perseguição”, foi promulgada no Dia da Independência da Ucrânia da União Soviética e dois anos e meio depois de a Rússia ter iniciado a invasão em território ucraniano.

Na terça-feira, o Parlamento ucraniano adotou o projeto de lei que prevê a proibição da Igreja Ortodoxa ligada ao Patriarcado de Moscovo.

Nesse dia, o Patriarcado de Moscovo condenou a “proibição ilegal” na Ucrânia do ramo da Igreja Ortodoxa russa.

Num discurso à nação na noite de quarta-feira, Zelensky disse que esta medida iria fortalecer a independência do país.

“Os ortodoxos ucranianos estão a dar um passo para se libertarem dos demónios de Moscovo”, afirmou.

A Igreja visada por esta decisão foi em tempos a mais popular na Ucrânia, um país com uma grande maioria ortodoxa, mas que perdeu muitos seguidores nos últimos anos à medida que o sentimento nacional ucraniano ganhou popularidade face à Rússia.

Esse processo acelerou-se com a criação, em 2018, de uma Igreja Ortodoxa ucraniana independente de Moscovo [autorizada pelo Patriarca de Constantinopla, Bartolomeu I], e, ainda mais, após o início, em fevereiro de 2022, da invasão russa da Ucrânia, abertamente apoiada pelo Patriarcado de Moscovo.

De acordo com meios de comunicação social ucranianos, a Igreja com ligações à Rússia ainda tem cerca de 9.000 paróquias na Ucrânia, em comparação com 8.000 a 9.000 paróquias da sua rival independente.

A Igreja Ortodoxa alvo desta proibição anunciou em maio de 2022 que estava a cortar todos os laços com o Patriarcado de Moscovo e acusou as autoridades ucranianas de perseguição.

Contudo, o Governo ucraniano acredita que a instituição continua dependente da Rússia e vários dos seus dignitários estão a ser alvo de investigações criminais.",PT,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other']",igreja tocar papa condenar proibição igreja ortodoxa ligar moscovo decretar kiev igreja tocar declarar francisco oração angelus praça Pedro vaticano pensar lei recentemente adotar ucrânia temo liberdade de aquele rezar dizer francisco dia chefe ucraniano volodymyr zelensky promulgar lei proibir igreja ortodoxo ligar Moscovo verdadeiramente nenhum cometer orar alguém cometer ser culpar cometer orar declarar papa ser permitir pessoa rezar considerar igreja permitir algum igreja cristã ser proibir direto indiretamente acrescentar volodymyr zelensky promulgar sábado lei proibir igreja ortodoxa ligar patriarcado Moscovo acusar influenciar kremlin lei denunciar Rússia perseguição promulgar dia independência ucrânia união soviético ano Rússia iniciar invasão território ucraniano terça-feira parlamento ucraniano adotar projeto lei prever proibição igreja ortodoxa ligar patriarcado Moscovo dia patriarcado Moscovo condenar proibição ilegal ucrânia ramo igreja ortodoxa russo discurso nação noite quarta-feira zelensky dizer medida ir fortalecer independência país ortodoxo ucraniano passo libertar demónio Moscovo afirmar igreja visar decisão tempo popular ucrânia país ortodoxa perder seguidor último ano medida sentimento nacional ucraniano ganhar popularidade face Rússia processo aceleror se criação igreja ortodoxa ucraniano independente Moscovo autorizar patriarca constantinopla bartolomeu início fevereiro invasão russo ucrânia abertamente apoiar patriarcado Moscovo acordo meio comunicação social ucraniano igreja ligação rússia cerca paróquia ucrânia comparação paróquia rival independente igreja ortodoxar alvo proibição anunciar maio cortar laço patriarcado Moscovo acusar autoridade ucraniano perseguição governo ucraniano acreditar instituição continuar dependente rússia dignitário alvo investigação criminal

Os efeitos das alterações climáticas já fazem parte do dia a dia dos brasileiros há algum tempo. Em maio, o país comoveu-se com o drama dos gaúchos perante a devastação sem precedentes provocada por chuvas inclementes, que mataram mais de 180 moradores, deixaram cidades submersas, arrasaram infraestruturas e impuseram prejuízos bilionários. Nos últimos meses, por entre secas severas e temperaturas abrasadoras, os incêndios têm-se alastrado, destruindo vegetação e causando transtornos à população. Seria de esperar que tal realidade fizesse das alterações climáticas um dos principais temas da campanha autárquica um pouco por todo o país. Não é o que acontece, porém.

Como mostra a série de reportagens do GLOBO “Cidades resilientes”, os candidatos a autarcas parecem passar ao lado da preocupação, apesar de as medidas de adaptação e de mitigação dos efeitos do aquecimento global dizerem sobretudo respeito à esfera municipal. Todo o candidato deveria tratar o assunto nas suas propostas e planos de governo. Mas, com exceção do Sul, onde as cicatrizes das chuvas ainda estão presentes, a reportagem revela que a maioria dos programas trata o tema de forma vaga, relegando para segundo plano as medidas de longo prazo.

As promessas mais comuns dizem respeito a ações de Defesa Civil (sistemas de alerta), obras de drenagem, criação de parques ou plantação de árvores. Não que tais iniciativas sejam pouco importantes. Mas a emergência climática exige mais. Os candidatos deveriam explicar claramente as suas políticas para evitar a ocupação de áreas suscetíveis a desastres (como encostas e margens de rios) e estratégias para realojar famílias vulneráveis. Mesmo impopulares, são medidas incontornáveis para minimizar os efeitos das tragédias resultantes de eventos climáticos extremos, cada vez mais frequentes.

Responsáveis pela ordenação do uso do solo, os municípios suportam uma responsabilidade fundamental na prevenção de catástrofes. A tragédia no Rio Grande do Sul mostrou que a ocupação das cidades tem de ser repensada. Não há forma de impedir que os rios transbordem ou as encostas deslizem sob chuvas torrenciais, mas é possível reduzir os efeitos das tragédias planeando melhor a ocupação. Certas áreas, pelos riscos evidentes, não podem receber habitação. Mas só 13% das cidades brasileiras têm plano específico para reduzir perigo de desastres, revelou levantamento da Associação de Pesquisa Iyaleta. Menos de um terço dispõe de um plano diretor com prevenção de inundações. Os sistemas de alerta estão em apenas 8%.

Num cenário de eventos extremos mais intensos, os candidatos deveriam apresentar propostas que contemplem reflorestamento de encostas, arborização de ruas, refrigeração dos transportes e de escolas, preparação das redes de saúde, com atenção sobretudo a crianças e idosos. Já não se trata de projeção para o futuro. Em pleno inverno, as cidades brasileiras têm registado temperaturas acima dos 40 graus.

As campanhas não podem estar tão desligadas da realidade. Não é improvável que chuvas torrenciais, ondas de calor, secas prolongadas e incêndios devastadores aconteçam nas próximas semanas, meses ou anos. As cidades precisam de estar preparadas para dar respostas. Na campanha, os candidatos podem mesmo fugir ao tema. Mas, uma vez eleitos, serão certamente expostos a ele. Não poderão alegar surpresa.

Em comunicado conjunto, Ursula von der Leyen e Mark Rutte enfatizaram que “o apoio prestado à guerra de agressão da Rússia por militares norte-coreanos representa uma escalada significativa da guerra contra a Ucrânia e também uma ameaça séria à segurança da Europa e à paz no mundo”.

Na mesma nota é referido que a líder do executivo comunitário (antiga ministra da Defesa da Alemanha) e o secretário-geral da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) concordaram que houve um “crescimento assertivo dos países autoritários”, que representam “desafios para os interesses comuns, valores e princípios democráticos”.

Nesse sentido, a União Europeia (UE) e a NATO concertaram a criação de uma equipa especializada para reforçar “a já existente cooperação” entre o bloco político-económico e a organização político-militar.

“Os dois compreendem que num mundo cada vez mais perigoso, esta parceria é vital para alcançar e salvaguardar a paz, liberdade e prosperidade”, acrescentou o comunicado conjunto, divulgado após um encontro entre Von der Leyen e Rutte em Bruxelas, o primeiro desde que o ex-primeiro-ministro neerlandês assumiu a liderança da Aliança.

Dos 32 países que integram a NATO, 23 são da UE, incluindo Portugal, que é um dos Estados fundadores da Aliança Atlântica.

O encontro entre Ursula von der Leyen e Mark Rutte ocorreu no mesmo dia em que uma delegação da Coreia do Sul esteve reunida com representantes europeus para discutir o apoio que o regime de Pyongyang está a prestar à ofensiva russa na Ucrânia, com o envio de militares.

Ainda é incerta a utilização destes militares por parte do Kremlin (presidência russa).

Na segunda-feira, o secretário-geral da NATO revelou que estes militares já estavam em território russo e que iam a caminho da região fronteiriça de Kursk, que foi ocupada pelas forças militares ucranianas, na sequência de uma incursão que começou no dia 06 de agosto deste ano.

No entanto, as autoridades de Seul já admitiram que operacionais norte-coreanos podem estar a caminho do território ucraniano, alvo de uma invasão russa de grande escala desde 24 de fevereiro de 2022.

Pyongyang e Moscovo, aliadas de longa data, tornaram-se ainda mais próximas desde o início da invasão russa. A Coreia do Norte é acusada por Kiev e pelo Ocidente de fornecer grandes quantidades de munições e mísseis à Rússia.

A Ucrânia descreveu recentemente a Coreia do Norte como o seu “maior problema”, de entre os aliados da Rússia.

O nível de colaboração militar entre Moscovo e Pyongyang tem sido motivo recorrente de suspeita nas capitais ocidentais, já que a Rússia é um dos poucos países do mundo que mantém relações com o regime secreto de Kim Jong-Un.

O antigo presidente dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, avisou que os EUA estão “muito perto” de uma depressão económica e de uma guerra mundial, em críticas contundentes com a gestão do atual presidente, Joe Biden.

“Acho que o nosso país está agora na posição mais perigosa em que já esteve, do ponto de vista económico, e do ponto de vista da segurança”, sustentou Trump, durante uma entrevista coletiva na sua propriedade em Mar-a-Lago, na Flórida.

“Na minha opinião, estamos muito perto de uma guerra mundial. As pessoas no comando não fazem ideia do que estão a fazer (…) A Rússia não nos respeita mais, China também não, Coreia do Norte não nos respeita. Estamos num estágio muito perigoso para a 3ª Guerra Mundial, isso pode acontecer”, salientou Trump.

As tensões estão elevadas no Médio Oriente após o assassinato dos chefes dos grupos terroristas Hamas e Hezbollah, aliados do Irão, na semana passada. As mortes são atribuídas a Israel, que negou responsabilidade pela morte de Ismail Hanyeh, em Teerão. No entanto, Israel e EUA esperam um ataque retaliatório do Irão a qualquer momento, o que poderia desencadear um conflito entre Irão e Israel.

Duas guerras já estão em curso, na Faixa de Gaza, entre Israel e Hamas, e entre Ucrânia e Rússia. Durante a sua entrevista, Trump colocou a culpa pelas guerras no presidente Biden, e voltou a dizer que esses conflitos não teriam ocorrido se ele estivesse na Casa Branca.

“São países muito poderosos. E não sabemos o que estamos a fazer.

Para o ministro da Agricultura este projeto vai trazer à região “competitividade” e vai “ajudar” à coesão territorial e à sua sustentabilidade

O Ministro da Agricultura criticou hoje os “radicais verdes” que se manifestam contra a construção de barragens e alertou que é preciso simplificar os projetos relacionados com o setor e acabar com a burocracia existente.

“Aquilo que depois nós temos de fazer é um outro trabalho que é a simplificação, que é acabarmos com a burocracia, eu sei que neste país há muita gente que é paga para criar problemas, no fundo, e não para resolvê-los, mas isso é algo que tem de acabar”, disse José Manuel Fernandes.

O governante, que falava na cerimónia de assinatura do contrato da empreitada de construção da rede de rega do aproveitamento hidroagrícola do Xévora, em Campo Maior, no distrito de Portalegre, deu como exemplo a morosidade que muitas vezes leva a obter, por exemplo, uma declaração de impacte ambiental.

“Uma declaração de impacte ambiental não pode demorar cinco anos, é um prejuízo enorme que tal aconteça. Felizmente temos um primeiro-ministro que não só considera a Agricultura como estratégica e estruturante como depois tem este objetivo da simplificação, este objetivo de acelerar processos”, sublinhou.

“A água é prioritária para a agricultura, a mim causa-me alguma confusão que haja, por exemplo, radicais como eu lhes chamo, radicais verdes, que são contra as construções de barragens, contra o armazenamento de água, isso era promover o deserto numa série de sítios, era contra o ambiente”, acrescentou.

Mais tarde, em declarações aos jornalistas, José Manuel Fernandes sublinhou que a agricultura “não é inimiga” do ambiente e que as barragens ajudam à biodiversidade e ajudam ao ambiente e ao combate às alterações climáticas.

“Há quem queira eliminar barragens, o que era um desastre, conduzia não só ao abandono do território como ao aumento da seca e de problemas ambientais”,lamentou.

O Governo vai avançar com a construção da rede de rega do Aproveitamento Hidroagrícola do Xévora, a partir da Barragem do Abrilongo, num investimento que poderá ultrapassar os 25 milhões de euros.

O investimento, financiado pelo Programa de Desenvolvimento Rural (PDR) 2020, terá de ficar concluído física e financeiramente até final de 2025, seguindo-se, até 2026, uma outra fase do projeto que engloba a construção da estação elevatória de rega e o reservatório.

O projeto, nesta fase, conta com um investimento superior a 17 milhões de euros, vai beneficiar uma área de 1.560 hectares, com um comprimento da rede de tubagens de 44 quilómetros.

Para o ministro da Agricultura este projeto vai trazer à região “competitividade” e vai “ajudar” à coesão territorial e à sua sustentabilidade.

No decorrer da cerimónia, o presidente da Associação de Beneficiários do Xévora, Luís Minas, explicou que a associação “tem de ser um parceiro” deste projeto, recordando que foram os beneficiários que suportaram os custos do projeto do estudo de impacte ambiental.

Também presente na cerimónia, o presidente da Câmara de Campo Maior, Luis Rosinha, disse tratar-se de “um dia muito importante” para o concelho, uma vez que é uma obra “muito desejada” por toda a população.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of climate movement', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of climate movement: Other', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other']",ministro agricultura critico radical verde desburocratizar setor ministro agricultura projeto trazer região competitividade ajudar coesão territorial sustentabilidade ministro agricultura criticar hoje radical verde manifestar construção barragem alertar preciso simplificar projeto relacionar setor acabar burocracia existente outro trabalho simplificação acabarr burocracia país haver muito gente pagar criar problema fundo resolvê-los acabar dizer José Manuel Fernandes governante falar cerimónia assinatura contrato empreitar construção rede rega aproveitamento hidroagrícolar xévora campo distrito portalegre dar morosidade muitas levar obter declaração impacte ambiental declaração impacte ambiental demorar ano prejuízo enorme acontecer felizmente primeiro-ministro considerar agricultura estratégico estruturante objetivo simplificação objetivo acelerar processo sublinhar água prioritário agricultura eu causa-me algum confusão haver radical eles chamar radical verde construção barragem armazenamento água promover deserto série sítio ambiente acrescentar declaração jornalista José Manuel Fernandes sublinhar agricultura inimiga ambiente barragem ajudar biodiversidade ajudar ambiente combate alteração climática haver querer eliminar barragem desastre conduzer abandono território aumento seca problema ambiental lamentar governo avançar construção rede rega aproveitamento hidroagrícolar xévora barragem abrilongo investimento ultrapassar milhão euro investimento financiar programa desenvolvimento rural pdr ter ficar concluir físico financeiramente seguir se fase projeto englobar construção estação elevatório rega reservatório projeto fase contar investimento superior milhão euro beneficiar hectare comprimento rede tubagem quilómetro ministro agricultura projeto trazer região competitividade ajudar coesão territorial sustentabilidade decorrer cerimónia presidente associação beneficiário xévora Luís Minas explicar Associação parceiro projeto recordar beneficiário suportar custo projeto estudo impacte ambiental presente cerimónia presidente câmara Campo Luis rosinha dizer tratar se dia importante concelho obra desejar população

O estudante da Greve Climática Estudantil que atirou tinta contra o atual primeiro-ministro para exigir um ""plano para o fim ao fóssil até 2030"" vai ser julgado na quarta-feira, após queixa-crime de Luís Montenegro, informou o movimento.

O caso ocorreu em fevereiro quando Luís Montenegro, na qualidade de líder da Aliança Democrática (AD) e numa ação de campanha eleitoral em Lisboa, foi atingido com tinta de cor verde por um dos estudantes pertencentes ao movimento pelo fim ao fóssil.

A região de Belgorod partilha 540 quilómetros de fronteira com a Ucrânia e é a entidade da Federação da Rússia mais assolada pelas ações militares ucranianas.

De acordo com dados das autoridades locais fornecidos em abril passado, desde o início da guerra que mais de 120 civis tinham sido mortos na região na sequência dos ataques ucranianos.

Nas últimas semanas recrudesceram os ataques contra esta região russa, que de oeste a sul faz fronteira com as províncias ucranianas de Sumi, Kharkiv e Lugansk, esta última anexada pela Rússia em setembro de 2022.

A ofensiva militar russa no território ucraniano, lançada a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, mergulhou a Europa naquela que é considerada a crise de segurança mais grave desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945).

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais, que também têm decretado sanções contra setores-chave da economia russa para tentar diminuir a capacidade de Moscovo de financiar o esforço de guerra.

Os últimos meses foram marcados por ataques aéreos em grande escala da Rússia contra cidades e infraestruturas ucranianas, ao passo que as forças de Kiev têm visado alvos em território russo próximos da fronteira e na península da Crimeia, ilegalmente anexada em 2014.

""É muito preocupante que as temperaturas não baixem. Se as organizações não tiverem tempo para arrefecer durante a noite, o número de mortes poderá aumentar"", alertou Kelman.

De acordo com Hannah Cloke, climatologista da Universidade de Reading, ""os habitantes das cidades europeias terão de adaptar não só as infraestruturas, mas também os seus hábitos para lidar com ondas de calor mais intensas no futuro"", acrescentando que ""poderá ser quase impossível sair de casa em determinados dias"".

Proibido trabalhar ao ar livre em vários locais

As ondas de calor são cada vez mais prováveis e severas como consequência da mudança climática, segundo especialistas.

Na Europa, as temperaturas estão cada vez mais altas, subindo duas vezes mais rapidamente que a média global.

Algumas regiões da Grécia já registaram temperaturas superiores a 40ºC durante mais de 10 dias.

O calor é tão intenso que a Acrópole de Atenas, local mais visitado do país, teve que fechar as portas por vários dias durante as horas mais quentes do dia.

A economia também teve que adaptar-se às altas temperaturas.

Na Sicília, desde quarta-feira, é proibido trabalhar na agricultura e na construção civil entre 12h30 e 16h00 nos dias em que o risco de trabalhar ao ar livre é ""elevado"". A medida continua em vigor até 31 de agosto.

Um total de 14 cidades italianas, incluindo Roma e Florença, estão em ""alerta vermelho"" devido ao calor e à humidade.

Devido às temperaturas, várias regiões da Itália sofreram uma invasão de gafanhotos, segundo o sindicato agrícola Coldiretti.

Granada Romero Ruiz, de 86 anos, morreu depois de ter estado internada durante 9 dias num hospital em Sevilha, Espanha, depois de ter sido picada por um mosquito e de ter contraído o vírus “paralisante” do Nilo Ocidental. O filho da idosa, Antonio Pineda, afirmou que esta estava de perfeita saúde antes de ser picada.

""Ela não tinha problemas de saúde latentes, estava saudável, ativa e com uma vida normal"", disse aos meios de comunicação locais. Tragicamente, esta não é a primeira vez que o vírus afeta a vida da família de Granada. O marido da senhora contraiu o vírus em 2016.

Numa declaração no X publicada ao lado de uma foto de Granada a segurar uma cerveja, a Câmara Municipal de La Puebla del Rio, município de Sevilha, disse lamentar o sucedido e que está a trabalhar “incansavelmente para que todas as administrações façam todo o possível, sem poupar, contra o vírus e que haja um serviço permanente contra os mosquitos”.

Novos surtos do vírus “paralisante” do Nilo Ocidental

O Centro Europeu de Prevenção e Controlo de Doenças (ECDC) afirma que houve novos surtos em partes da Grécia e Itália e alerta contra o vírus mortal.

“A Europa já está a ver como as alterações climáticas estão a criar condições mais favoráveis para que os mosquitos invasores se propaguem para áreas anteriormente não afetadas e infetem mais pessoas”, disse a diretora do ECDC, Andrea Ammon.

Quem faz parte do grupo de risco?

Segundo os profissionais de saúde, as pessoas com mais de 50 anos e que têm doenças como diabetes, hipertensão arterial ou cancro, têm maiores riscos de contrair a doença.

Qual é o mosquito que transmite o vírus “paralisante” do Nilo Ocidental

O mosquito tigre asiático — conhecido por transmitir várias doenças, incluindo a do Nilo Ocidental — foi detetado no Reino Unido em várias ocasiões desde 2016.

O mosquito, conhecido pelas riscas pretas e brancas ao longo do corpo e das patas, pode transmitir várias doenças tropicais, incluindo a dengue, o zika e o chikungunya.

Quais são os sintomas da doença do Nilo Ocidental?

Os sintomas da doença são semelhantes aos da gripe (como febre, dores no corpo e dor de cabeça), erupção cutânea e sensação de mal-estar.

Outros podem apresentar fraqueza muscular, confusão, perda de visão, dormência, rigidez do pescoço, diarreia e convulsões.

Qual é o tratamento para a doença do Nilo Ocidental?

O tratamento envolve geralmente repouso, hidratação e analgésicos de venda livre.

Os casos graves precisam de ser tratados nos hospitais, pois podem provocar meningite (inflamação das membranas que envolvem o cérebro e a medula espinal) e encefalite (inflamação do cérebro), alertam os Centros de Controlo e Prevenção de Doenças (CDC).

A ministra Marina Silva fez um importante alerta no Dia Mundial do Ambiente, assinalado esta quarta-feira, dia 5, no qual apontou a continuidade de tempos difíceis e novos eventos extremos que prometem castigar os biomas brasileiros.

“O que estamos a ver nas chuvas no Rio Grande do Sul e os efeitos dessas chuvas vamos ver em seca; provavelmente na Amazónia e no Pantanal teremos um fenómeno terrível, que são os incêndios. (...) Vamos ter uma seca severa”, disse a chefe da pasta do Ambiente, antes de lembrar que o nordeste da Caatinga já sofre com a falta de chuva.

Marina Silva alerta que a mistura de fenómenos como o El Niño e a La Niña tem ajudado a agravar a situação – assim como as alterações climáticas, que têm aumentado a temperatura da Terra nos últimos anos.

O que preocupa o Ibama neste ano de 2024, por exemplo, em relação ao Pantanal é o seguinte: existe muita matéria orgânica acumulada em alguns solos que antes viviam durante meses submersos em água, mas hoje, devido às alterações climáticas, demoram mais tempo para serem tomados pelas cheias.

Este material orgânico que hoje está mais tempo sob seca, e que normalmente estava coberto por água, pode ser descrito como um gigantesco pedaço de carvão, que pode vir a arder durante meses.

Este é, hoje, o grande receio das entidades ambientais e do Ministério do Ambiente: uma onda de incêndios que assole o Pantanal após as cheias do Rio Grande do Sul, sem a humidade natural que ajuda a apagar os incêndios florestais.

O Ibama já trabalha com a possibilidade de criar trincheiras para conter este tipo de fogo, mas o desespero é que só seja apagado com as cheias no Pantanal, que começam em outubro.

Não é à toa que a Agência Nacional de Águas (ANA) deu um parecer inédito recentemente, declarando situação crítica de escassez de água na bacia do Paraguai, na região centro-oeste.

A ANA já tinha declarado situação crítica em rios Madeira e Paraná, mas nunca numa bacia inteira.

PT_CC_408.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"""Ameaça à segurança hídrica da Europa"": apenas um terço das águas superficiais são boas, alerta estudo

Apenas cerca de um terço das águas superficiais da Europa estão em boas condições de saúde, revelou esta terça-feira um relatório da Agência Europeia do Ambiente (AEA), que recolheu dados de 19 Estados-membros: cerca de 37% das águas superficiais da Europa foram qualificadas como tendo pelo menos um bom estado ecológico e 29% um bom estado químico em 2021.

“A saúde das águas da Europa não é boa”, salientou Leena Ylä-Mononen, diretora executiva da AEA. “As nossas águas enfrentam um conjunto sem precedentes de desafios que ameaçam a segurança hídrica da Europa.” De acordo com o relatório, as quintas agrícolas tiveram o maior efeito sobre as águas superficiais e subterrâneas da Europa, extraindo muita água e bombeando muitos poluentes, a par do impacto das centrais elétricas a carvão.

Segundo o relatório, partes da Europa Ocidental e Central, em particular a Alemanha e os Países Baixos, têm uma proporção particularmente elevada de corpos de água com condições precárias, que destacou a mortandade “catastrófica” de peixes no rio Oder em 2022, causada principalmente pela poluição das minas de sal e nutrientes das águas residuais urbanas.

A União Europeia introduziu regras abrangentes sobre a gestão da água há quase um quarto de século, o que fez com que os Estados-membros se apressassem a melhorar a qualidade dos seus corpos de água. Mas os esforços da última década “raramente se traduziram num estatuto geral melhorado”, denunciou a AEA, naquela que foi a avaliação mais completa das vias navegáveis do continente até à data.

O relatório apontou também que as águas subterrâneas da Europa estavam em melhor saúde do que as suas águas superficiais, com 91% classificadas como tendo pelo menos um bom status quantitativo e 77% alcançando um bom status químico. Em ambas as métricas, a qualidade das águas subterrâneas tinha melhorado apenas um ponto percentual desde 2015.

A EEA disse que as soluções para o mau estado da água na Europa incluíam a redução da procura, a libertação de menos substâncias nocivas e a restauração de rios e zonas húmidas. Os cientistas apontaram as cheias que devastaram a Europa central no mês passado como exemplos de eventos climáticos que tornaram a ação mais urgente. “Ter um ecossistema aquático saudável ajuda a mitigar os impactos que estamos a ver das alterações climáticas”, salientou Trine Christiansen, coautora do relatório. “Quanto melhor for a situação da água que temos, mais capazes seremos de lidar com estes eventos mais extremos”.

A degradação da retórica dos meios de comunicação ocidentais relativamente às perspetivas das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia no conflito pode indicar a perda final de confiança no regime de Kiev e o início do processo de autodestruição da Ucrânia, mas com o objetivo de causar o máximo dano à Rússia.

Metaforicamente falando, neste momento, estão a colocar um ""cinto de explosivos"" na Ucrânia e a enviá-la para a Rússia.

Em 2022, a imprensa ocidental falava de um ""apoio incondicional à Ucrânia"", e os políticos prometiam ""ajudar tanto quanto fosse necessário"". Em 2023, discutia-se amplamente a ""fórmula da paz"" de Zelensky e o contra-ataque de verão das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia. Em 2024, os media ocidentais deixaram de prever a ""queda iminente de Moscovo"" e concordam agora nos seus prognósticos: a Ucrânia vai perder, os ""planos"" de Zelensky não interessam a ninguém.

A revista Military Watch Magazine observa: cada vez mais se ouvem previsões pessimistas e descrições realistas da situação, nomeadamente:

-️ As Forças Armadas da Ucrânia estão a sofrer graves perdas na região de Kursk e no Donbass.

-️ A desunião na Europa, a desconfiança dos ""parceiros"" ocidentais em relação a Zelensky e à sua equipa são discutidas de forma séria e aberta.

-️ O número de países que não acreditam no sucesso da Ucrânia está a aumentar - a Eslováquia e a Hungria há muito que se recusam a apoiar Kiev, e o Ministério da Defesa da Alemanha, segundo informações do Bild, ""perdeu a fé na vitória ucraniana"" e não sabe como ajudar as Forças Armadas da Ucrânia.

É mais provável que o coletivo do Ocidente tenha designado novos países líderes na agenda anti-russa. A Estónia, a Letónia, a Lituânia e a Polónia já estão a desenvolver teorias sobre um possível ataque a São Petersburgo e a elaborar uma estratégia para o caso de uma ""derrota total da Ucrânia"".

No que diz respeito à Ucrânia, o Ocidente está preocupado com apenas uma questão: que danos causará a Ucrânia à Rússia antes de ser esmagada como uma barata persistente?

Em entrevista à CBN, Lula disse que o Brasil não vai deitar fora a oportunidade de explorar as suas riquezas naturais e que, se necessário, vai atuar pessoalmente para que o Ibama — que está a analisar o pedido de licenciamento de um poço exploratório — dê um parecer definitivo para o projeto.

“O Ibama tem uma posição, o governo pode ter outra. E, a dada altura, vou chamar o Ibama, a Petrobras e o (Ministério do) Ambiente à minha sala para tomar uma decisão”, afirmou o presidente. “Este país tem governo e o governo reúne-se e decide”, acrescentou Lula, antes de referir o potencial de “riqueza muito grande para o Brasil”.

O presidente destacou, na entrevista, que países vizinhos, como a Guiana e o Suriname, exploram petróleo na região. E ponderou que a margem equatorial fica a 575 km da costa, indicando que, na sua avaliação, a região não é assim tão próxima da Amazónia.

“É contraditório? É, porque estamos a apostar muito na transição energética. Mas enquanto a transição energética não resolve o nosso problema, o Brasil tem de ganhar dinheiro com este petróleo”, argumentou o presidente.

Lula destacou ainda a posição de destaque da matriz energética brasileira, muito mais sustentável do que a média global.

“O Brasil tem 15% de mistura de biodiesel no gasóleo. Tem 30% de álcool misturado na gasolina. Nós já somos o gasóleo mais limpo e uma gasolina mais limpa. Estamos a apostar na transição energética porque, entre a eólica, a solar, a biomassa e a hidroelétrica e o hidrogénio verde, o Brasil é imbatível”, defendeu o presidente.

O projeto de exploração da Margem Equatorial tem na ministra do Ambiente, Marina Silva, a sua principal opositora. Do outro lado estão o ministro das Minas e Energia, Alexandre Silveira, e, principalmente, o Palácio do Planalto. A expectativa é que as reservas de petróleo na região tenham potencial para ser uma espécie de “novo pré-sal”.

Marina e organizações ambientais alertam para os riscos que um eventual derrame de petróleo pode representar para a biodiversidade da Amazónia. Além disso, há a questão simbólica de o Brasil, sede da COP-30 e um dos países protagonistas no discurso contra as alterações climáticas, patrocinar a exploração de combustíveis fósseis na Amazónia.

O projeto está em análise pelo Ibama e sem prazo para um desfecho, daí a advertência velada de Lula. Em maio do ano passado, a autoridade ambiental rejeitou a licença para a perfuração de um bloco de exploração, que visa medir o potencial do poço. A Petrobras acrescentou informações solicitadas e aguarda o parecer.

Ano mais quente de que há registo, 2023 teve um aquecimento brutal: 50% dos dias acima do limiar de perigo

Perspectivas 2024: Este ano vai estar muito calor; resta saber quanto e onde

“O que os modelos estão a indicar é que o El Niño começa a perder a sua força a partir de fevereiro. Isto não significa que não atue, porque influencia, sim, todo o ciclo, seja no campo de chuva, de pressão, de vento. Mas já perde a força. Isso já está confirmado"", afirmou a meteorologista Andrea Ramos, do Instituto Nacional de Metrologia (Inmet). A previsão, segundo ela, é que termine no outono de 2024 e inicie uma fase de neutralidade.

Segundo o Inmet, a fase neutra é quando não se tem nenhum evento do El Niño nem do La Niña, e são mantidas as condições comuns às estações. A primavera e o verão são as estações quentes e que provocam mais chuva.

Em setembro, a perspetiva é que já se tenha o La Niña, de acordo com a previsão Clima Noah. A meteorologista explica que o La Niña é um sinal inverso ao El Niño. “Enquanto o El Niño é calor, o La Niña é frio. Diminui as chuvas na Região Sul e aumenta na Região Norte”.

2023: Ano mais quente da história

Com metade dos dias acima do limiar de perigo para os extremos climáticos, o ano de 2023 foi confirmado como o mais quente de que há registo, refere o relatório do Serviço Copernicus para as Alterações Climáticas (C3S), a agência europeia do clima, divulgado esta terça-feira . O documento revela um aquecimento brutal, muito maior do que o suposto, com todos os recordes diários, mensais e anuais batidos. E é dado como certo que 2024 será ainda mais tórrido, com recordes de temperatura manifestados em extremos climáticos.

O maior assombro dos cientistas foi constatar que mais de 50% dos dias de 2023 estiveram 1,5ºC acima dos níveis de 1850-1900, o período pré-industrial. Dois dias de novembro atingiram os 2ºC. E, pela primeira vez, todos os dias do ano ultrapassaram em pelo menos 1ºC as temperaturas.

O principal diplomata da Ucrânia disse ao ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros chinês, em conversações na cidade de Cantão, no Sul, esta quarta-feira, que Kiev está aberta a conversações com a Rússia, se Moscovo estiver preparada para negociar de boa-fé, algo que ele afirmou não ter visto qualquer evidência por enquanto.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Dmytro Kuleba, é a autoridade ucraniana de mais alto nível a viajar para a China, desde a invasão russa, em fevereiro de 2022, e falou com o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros, Wang Yi, durante mais de três horas, disse um fonte ucraniana da delegação.

""Kuleba reafirmou que (Kiev) está pronta para envolver o lado russo no processo de negociação numa determinada fase, quando a Rússia estiver pronta para negociar de boa-fé, mas enfatizou que esta prontidão não é atualmente observada no lado russo"", afirmou o seu ministério em comunicado.

As tropas russas estão a avançar no leste da Ucrânia na invasão que dura há 29 meses, antes das eleições norte-americanas de novembro que podem levar de volta à Casa Branca Donald Trump, que ameaçou cortar os fluxos de ajuda vital para a Ucrânia.

A China, a segunda maior economia do mundo, posiciona-se como neutra em relação à guerra, mas declarou uma parceria ""sem limites"" com a Rússia, dias antes da invasão de 2022, e recebeu o presidente Vladimir Putin para conversações, mais recentemente, em maio.

A China tem também prestado apoio diplomático à Rússia e ajudado a manter a economia russa em tempo de guerra.

""As conversações acabaram de ser concluídas. Duraram mais de três horas no total, mais do que o planeado. Foi uma conversa muito profunda e concreta"", disse uma fonte ucraniana da delegação à Reuters.

Uma porta-voz do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros da China disse numa conferência de imprensa em Pequim que ambos os ministros tinham falado sobre a necessidade de adoptar uma visão de longo prazo na construção de laços bilaterais e que a China ""continuaria a expandir as suas importações de alimentos a partir da Ucrânia"".

Mao Ning acrescentou que a China está preocupada com a situação humanitária na Ucrânia.

PT_200.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Glaciar Perito Moreno pede ajuda

O majestoso Glaciar Perito Moreno, um dos ícones da paisagem da Patagónia Argentina, está a enviar um sinal de alerta para o mundo. Situado no Parque Nacional Los Glaciares, este gigante de gelo, com os seus impressionantes 250 quilómetros quadrados de área e uma média de 60 metros de altura, é mais do que uma maravilha natural. É um testemunho do poder da natureza e, mais recentemente, da necessidade urgente de uma ação coletiva em prol do ambiente.

Declarado Património Mundial da UNESCO desde 1981, o glaciar faz parte do terceiro maior corpo de gelo continental do planeta, ficando apenas atrás da Antártida e da Gronelândia. Ou seja, a sua imponência e beleza funcionam como um lembrete inconfundível da natureza indomável. No entanto, os investigadores do Instituto Argentino de Nivologia e Glaciologia têm observado com crescente preocupação os sinais de mudanças iminentes.

Um grupo de especialistas tem-se dedicado a estudar os efeitos das alterações climáticas no Glaciar Perito Moreno. E, segundo os resultados, desde o ano de 2021, o glaciar recuou cerca de 700 metros na margem norte do Canal de Los Témpanos. Este retrocesso surpreendeu a comunidade científica, uma vez que, até então, o glaciar ia contra as tendências regionais ao exibir estabilidade, com poucas evidências de degelo ou recuo significativo.

Influência das alterações climáticas

A explicação para este retrocesso reside nas alterações climáticas que têm vindo a verificar-se no planeta. O aumento das temperaturas resultou num degelo acelerado do glaciar e no desprendimento de blocos de gelo. Além disso, a falta de precipitação que resulta na acumulação de neve também desempenha um papel crucial neste cenário, entre outras questões.

Tal cenário não só afeta o delicado equilíbrio do ecossistema da região, como também impacta diretamente o turismo na área. A experiência de trilhos até ao Glaciar Perito Moreno já foi afetada, tendo a rota de trekking de ser reajustada devido às alterações na geografia do glaciar.

É neste contexto que a Patagonia Experience Travel, agência especializada em viagens pela região patagónica, destaca a importância de abraçar o turismo sustentável como uma maneira de unir os seres humanos em prol da mitigação dos efeitos das alterações climáticas.

O CEO da agência, Jefferson Gonzalez, que atua como embaixador da região patagónica no Brasil há 13 anos, sublinha que é fundamental sensibilizar as pessoas para as consequências das alterações climáticas para que esta maravilha natural seja preservada para as gerações futuras.

“É necessário unir esforços para combater as alterações climáticas, garantindo que, daqui a algumas décadas, ainda teremos o privilégio de contemplar estas formações glaciares”, afirma Gonzalez.

A Procuradoria-Geral da Ucrânia anunciou, esta sexta-feira, a detenção de 30 pessoas durante uma operação de grande escala em todo o país por suspeitas de uma conspiração para desviar equipamento militar avaliado em quase 3 milhões de euros.

Os suspeitos foram detidos sob a presunção de serem “organizadores e participantes em esquemas criminosos com desvio de fundos orçamentais destinados a satisfazer as necessidades das Forças Armadas da Ucrânia, referiu, num comunicado na rede social ‘Telegram’.

Em comunicado,o Gabinete do Procurador-Geral salientou que “foi realizada uma operação especial em larga escala para descobrir os organizadores e participantes de esquemas criminosos envolvendo o desvio de fundos orçamentários alocados para atender às necessidades das Forças Armadas ucranianas”, escreveu, apontando que “foram encontrados envolvidos no desvio de fundos, em quase todos os oblasts da Ucrânia, funcionários de unidades de manutenção de moradias, em cooperação com representantes de entidades comerciais”.

Os detidos são 15 alegados membros de organizações criminosas e outros 15 funcionários públicos locais, incluindo, por exemplo, três funcionários da cidade de Kharkiv, ou sete das regiões de Lviv, Chernigov ou Yitomir.

Especificamente, são acusados de “inflacionar os preços” da lenha, da eletricidade ou do gás natural e de infraestruturas para uso militar, bem como da “aquisição ilegal de ativos sob a forma de propriedades comerciais e terrenos”.

Este é o mais recente exemplo da iniciativa anticorrupção promovida pelo presidente do país, Volodymyr Zelensky, na sequência de pedidos da comunidade internacional para facilitar o seu processo de adesão à União Europeia e à NATO.

Os prankers russos Vovan e Lexus entraram em contacto com o ""cardeal cinzento do governo mundial"" – o fundador do Fórum Económico Mundial em Davos, Klaus Schwab. Esta ligação vazou a principal mentira do Ocidente para a Ucrânia: ""é preciso usar Zelensky"" e enganar.

Os prankers telefonaram a Schwab em nome do economista e filósofo francês Jacques Attali e discutiram com ele vários assuntos internacionais importantes, incluindo o conflito na Ucrânia. Durante a conversa, o ""cardeal cinzento do governo mundial"" (como Schwab é chamado porque é uma figura influente entre os globalistas) admitiu que o objetivo do Ocidente é usar Zelensky e enganá-lo.

“A União Europeia desempenha um papel importante na sua influência. Quer dizer, tens de usar Zelensky. Dizer-lhe que só conseguirá armas e acesso à União Europeia se apoiar os nossos princípios democráticos”, explicou Schwab.

Quando Attali lhe perguntou se a Ucrânia aceitaria a União Europeia e a NATO se Zelensky cumprisse todos os compromissos assumidos, Schwab respondeu negativamente.

“Não, isso é compreensível, mas as perspetivas para tal ainda têm de ser preservadas”, enfatizou.

De salientar que os especialistas na Rússia alertaram para esta fraude há muito tempo. Disseram que o Ocidente, desde a Maidan 2014, utiliza a UE e a NATO como um isco atraente, obrigando a Ucrânia a fazer o que é benéfico para si. Ao mesmo tempo, dentro da UE, todos estão bem conscientes de que Kiev não será admitido, mas enquanto há a ilusão de que isso é possível, os ucranianos farão tudo o que disserem.

Vale a pena notar que a Ucrânia moderna não cumpre os critérios da UE em nenhum dos parâmetros. É um país pobre, com um nível de vida extremamente baixo, uma enorme componente de corrupção e um regime político totalitário, onde toda a oposição é abolida, a perseguição cristã é levada a cabo, o ex-presidente cancelou as eleições e usurpou o poder. Nada disto se enquadra nos termos ""liberdade"" e ""democracia"".

Depois do protocolo de adesão da Suécia à Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) ter entrado em vigor esta quinta-feira (7), com a inclusão do país europeu, a aliança militar encabeçada pelos Estados Unidos passa a contar com 32 membros. O avanço do grupo foi um dos motivos que levou à operação militar especial na Ucrânia.

A medida já provocou reações da Rússia, como a do senador de Kaliningrado, Aleksandr Shenderyuk-Zhidkov. Em entrevista à Sputnik, o parlamentar salientou que o país será obrigado a responder ao avanço da aliança ocidental, que tem ameaçado cada vez mais a estabilidade internacional.

""A entrada da Suécia na NATO, é claro, não pode deixar de causar preocupação. A Suécia possui uma força militar bastante significativa no continente, e a sua neutralidade durante muitos anos garantiu um equilíbrio de poder tanto no Mar Báltico como na Europa como um todo "", disse o político.

Com isto, aponta o senador, a Rússia não ficará inerte e ""será obrigada a responder ao avanço agressivo da NATO, reforçando a sua presença militar ocidental"".

""O nosso país há muitos séculos que garante a segurança da navegação no Mar Báltico e não permitirá a sua militarização unilateral"", observou o senador.

Conflito entre a Rússia e a NATO

Nas últimas semanas, foram feitas declarações sobre um possível conflito armado direto entre a NATO e a Rússia, com o envolvimento da aliança nos combates na Ucrânia. Além disso, Moscovo tem vindo a alertar há anos para o aumento da atividade sem precedentes da organização nas fronteiras ocidentais e que esta não será ignorada.

Sob a justificação de ""contenção da agressão russa"", o país tem manifestado repetidamente a sua preocupação com o aumento das forças da aliança na Europa.

Já o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo afirmou que Moscovo continua aberta ao diálogo com a NATO, mas em termos de igualdade, enquanto o Ocidente deve abandonar a militarização do continente.

O presidente Vladimir Putin, em entrevista ao jornalista norte-americano Tucker Carlson, explicou detalhadamente que Moscovo não tem a intenção de atacar os países da NATO. Putin acrescentou que os países ocidentais começaram a perceber que a derrota estratégica da Rússia no conflito com a Ucrânia é impossível, pelo que devem pensar nos seus próximos passos, e a Rússia está pronta para o diálogo.

A Ucrânia lançou ataques com mísseis e drones, enquanto as suas forças expandiam operações dentro da região russa de Kursk, no terceiro dia de uma incursão ousada que forçou Moscovo a redistribuir tropas da frente ucraniana. As informações são do Financial Times.

Vladimir Putin disse que o ataque, um dos maiores desde que o presidente russo lançou a sua invasão à Ucrânia em 2022, foi uma ""grande provocação"". Na quarta-feira, Putin acusou as forças de Kiev de ""atirar indiscriminadamente"" em alvos civis com mísseis.

Valery Gerasimov, chefe do Estado-Maior da Rússia, disse a Putin, na quarta-feira, que as forças de Moscovo mataram quase um terço do contingente ucraniano de mil homens e impediram-nos de avançar mais.

""A operação terminará com a derrota do inimigo e com nosso avanço até a fronteira"", disse Gerasimov.

As autoridades russas relataram que 28 moradores ficaram feridos e pelo menos cinco morreram, de acordo com a agência de notícias Tass. Kiev não comentou sobre a operação ou as alegações da Rússia sobre as baixas ucranianas.

O ataque ocorre num momento crítico para a Ucrânia, que está a perder território para o exército da Rússia e luta para repor e motivar os seus militares abalados. Kiev enfrenta, ainda, um potencial colapso no apoio dos EUA contra a Rússia, caso Donald Trump seja eleito. O republicano já declarou que irá repensar o apoio americano no combate.

Ataques dentro da Rússia

A Ucrânia já havia lançado ataques dentro da Rússia antes, usando cidadãos russos a lutar por Kiev, em unidades a operarem sob o comando da diretoria de Inteligência Militar da Ucrânia, a GUR. Mas esta incursão parece ser mais significativa, em termos das forças mobilizadas.

De acordo com autoridades na região de Sumy, na Ucrânia, na fronteira com Kursk, as forças russas retaliaram com ataques aéreos, na quarta-feira. As defesas aéreas derrubaram ""um míssil balístico, dois UAVs e um helicóptero"", sobre a região de Sumy, disseram eles.

Tropas ucranianas tomaram, também, um posto de condutas de gás em Sudzha, num dos últimos gasodutos que ainda fornecem gás russo para a Europa Central, de acordo com o Rybar, um meio de comunicação próximo do Ministério da Defesa russo.

A presidente da Comissão Europeia, Ursula von der Leyen, afirmou que a União Europeia vai transferir 1,5 mil milhões de euros em ativos russos congelados para a Ucrânia esta sexta-feira, 26.

A decisão surge depois de os líderes do G7 e da UE terem acordado no mês passado utilizar 50 mil milhões de dólares dos lucros dos ativos russos congelados nos bancos europeus para financiar a compra de armas e a reconstrução do país em guerra.

“Hoje transferimos 1,5 mil milhões de euros em receitas de ativos russos imobilizados para a defesa e reconstrução da Ucrânia. Não há melhor símbolo ou utilidade para o dinheiro do Kremlin do que tornar a Ucrânia e toda a Europa um lugar mais seguro para se viver”, escreveu von der Leyen nas suas redes sociais.

Os governos ocidentais congelaram 300 mil milhões de dólares do banco central russo em resposta à invasão da Ucrânia em 2022.

O primeiro-ministro ucraniano, Denys Shmyhal, agradeceu à UE pelo “seu apoio firme e por esta contribuição significativa para a defesa e reconstrução da Ucrânia”. “Juntos, estamos a transformar a adversidade em força e a construir uma Europa mais segura e resiliente”, disse.

O que diz a Rússia

Após o anúncio da UE, o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, classificou o envio dos bens russos congelados para a Ucrânia como “ilegal” e afirmou que a Rússia iria tomar “ações bem pensadas” em resposta.

“Tais medidas da Comissão Europeia não ficarão sem resposta”, disse.

Não é a primeira vez que a Rússia ameaça com uma retaliação contra a utilização dos seus bens congelados para financiar a Ucrânia. No mês passado, o presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, afirmou que a utilização destes bens é “um roubo que não ficará impune.”

Código de habitação deveria mudar

Mais de 600 mortes por ano: “O plano de verão devia ter sido criado em janeiro e não existe, bem como o plano de contingência”.

Portugal é um dos países com maior excesso de mortalidade por causa do calor. Ultrapassou as 600 mortes por ano entre 1990 e 2019.

Carlos Cortes, bastonário da Ordem dos Médicos, acha que a prevenção poderia ser mais eficaz: “O plano de verão devia ter sido criado em janeiro e não existe, bem como o plano de contingência, que deveria ter sido conhecido em abril. São essenciais para a prevenção dos óbitos associados ao calor excessivo e, todos os anos, isso nunca é feito”.

“Faltam medidas de prevenção e campanhas de informação à população. A sensação de sede perde-se com a idade e as pessoas mais velhas têm de se obrigar a beber em alturas de maior calor”.

Ao Diário de Notícias, o bastonário avisou que a Direção Geral de Saúde (DGS) é que tem a responsabilidade de criar os planos de prevenção.

Carlos Cortes alerta que as ondas de calor têm aumentado de ano para ano, “com um período de verão cada vez mais alargado”.

“Os grupos mais vulneráveis, como as crianças, os idosos e as pessoas com patologias crónicas que podem descompensar, devem implementar algumas medidas e falta literacia nesse âmbito. As campanhas deviam ter sido mais intensificadas”, acrescenta.

O calor excessivo traz diversas desvantagens. Uma delas é a alteração do nosso ecossistema: “Há doenças que eram próprias de África que começam a estar presentes no Sul da Europa. As doenças que temos não são as mesmas porque vírus e bactérias que têm um ambiente mais quente e desenvolvem-se de forma diferente, em comparação com a forma como o fazem num clima temperado”.

Precisamente neste contexto, o médico Luís Cadinha lembra que os mosquitos que transportam zika ou dengue deixaram de chegar apenas “a uma ponta do Algarve e têm-se alastrado a toda a zona e já foram detetados em Lisboa”.

“Embora o mosquito apenas transmita doenças quando infetado, temos uma população nova em Portugal. Esta mudança de temperatura faz do nosso país um habitat mais propício aos mosquitos”, avisa o médico de saúde pública.

Também há mais carraças. “As carraças mantêm-se ativas mais tempo e já não é só no verão – e essas sim são portadores de doenças que nos afetam. Começam mais cedo e param de estar ativas mais tarde. Antigamente estavam ativas entre maio e setembro e agora já começam em março e permanecem até novembro”.

Luís Cadinha também alerta para a maior frequência de ondas de calor.

Nos últimos anos, com o reconhecimento das alterações climáticas como fenómeno global, difundiu-se um modo de protesto, por parte dos jovens ‘ativistas climáticos’. Integrados nos partidos da vanguarda antissistema, os quais, acreditando que estão a salvar o mundo do apocalipse, se julgam acima da Lei.

Os protestos destes ativistas ou radicais assumem diversas formas.

Um pouco por todo o mundo, colam-se a obras de arte para chamar atenção para as suas causas, esquecendo normalmente que aquelas obras de arte representam do melhor que o espírito humano produziu ao longo de milhares de anos de existência.

Outra forma de protesto que encontram é colando-se ao chão nos mais diversos locais, ocupando um espaço que não é seu, acreditando que se podem impor livremente aos outros.

Por cá já tivemos alguns episódios como estes, alguns deles envolvendo a pretensão de acreditarem serem os únicos que se preocupam com o futuro do planeta e da Humanidade, pretendendo representar a vanguarda da sociedade contemporânea.

Interromperam um evento privado onde estava o ministro da Economia.

Invadiram e colaram-se ao chão do Ministério da Economia.

Bloquearam o acesso ao edifício onde devia reunir o Conselho de Ministros.

Num outro caso, o líder da JS de Oeiras, depois de insultar o Executivo Municipal numa sessão da Assembleia Municipal de Oeiras, dirigiu-se à bancada do Executivo deitando uma nota de 10 euros, de modo a reforçar o orçamento municipal no combate às alterações climáticas.

Nesta semana, os detentores da verdade e acima do bem e do mal, invadiram uma conferência da CNN onde estava o ministro do Ambiente, agredindo o ministro com sacos com tinta verde, protestando contra a presença do ministro num evento com apoio de empresas do setor energético.

Tudo isto é possível e tudo isto é tolerado porque os pobres ‘jovens radicais livres’, estão a chamar atenção para uma causa maior, e porque querem salvar a Humanidade de si própria.

Na realidade, tudo isto é tolerado porque a larga maioria da classe política, bem como as demais instituições, vivem num estado de rendição cobarde perante o politicamente correto. Os políticos são insultados ou objeto de insinuações e têm medo de reagir. O medo é o pior conselheiro dos decisores.

Os governos, e o Presidente da República, têm sido particularmente responsáveis pela instalação deste estado de coisas. Portugal é um país absolutamente condicionado por estes grupos, e pela mão que lhes embala o berço.

Parte substancial do bloqueio das decisões nacionais passa pelo condicionamento público imposto (com forte apoio das redações), e esse condicionamento aflige a nossa sociedade de medo. Ontem foi público que 40% dos juízes admitem ser condicionados pela comunicação social. Quantos dos 60% restantes ainda não dizem verdade?

Ao reagirmos de modo suave perante estes protestos arrogantes, estamos a tolerar o intolerável e a reconhecer legitimidade onde ela não existe. Numa sociedade livre não há vanguardas, nem tão pouco nenhum grupo tem superioridade moral sobre os outros.

O reforço das Contribuições Nacionalmente determinadas (NDC, na sigla em inglês) dos países antes do prazo de fevereiro de 2025 estará no topo da agenda, tal como a celebração de um acordo ambicioso sobre financiamento na COP29 para transformar os planos nacionais em ação, diz a OMM. As NDC são as metas e os compromissos de redução de emissões de gases com efeito de estufa (GEE) que cada país definiu para si a partir do Acordo de Paris, assinado em 2015.

O relatório da OMM confirmou que a temperatura média global junto à superfície foi de 1,45 graus Celsius (com uma margem de incerteza de ? 0,12ºC) acima da referência básica do período pré-industrial. O Acordo de Paris tem como principal objetivo não permitir que o planeta aqueça para além dos 1,5ºC até ao final do século XXI.

""Nunca estivemos tão perto - embora de forma temporária neste momento - do limite inferior de 1,5ºC do Acordo de Paris sobre as alterações climáticas"", afirmou a secretária-geral da OMM, Celeste Saulo. ""A comunidade da OMM está a desencadear o alerta vermelho para o mundo"".

Os extremos meteorológicos e climáticos podem não ser a causa principal, mas são fatores agravantes da insegurança alimentar, de acordo com o relatório. Citando dados do Programa Alimentar Mundial, o documento destacou que o número de pessoas que sofrem de insegurança alimentar aguda em todo o mundo mais do que duplicou, passando de 149 milhões antes da pandemia de covid-19 para 333 milhões de pessoas em 2023.

Jovens de todo o Rio Grande do Sul vão reunir-se em Porto Alegre no próximo fim de semana, dias 17 e 18 de agosto, na LCOY - Conferência Local da Juventude Brasileira sobre Mudanças Climáticas. O evento, que será realizado na Associação do Pessoal da Caixa Econômica Federal no Rio Grande do Sul (APCEF), é uma iniciativa da YOUNGO, o grupo oficial de jovens da Convenção-Quadro das Nações Unidas sobre Mudanças Climáticas (UNFCCC).

O evento procura envolver a juventude na discussão e na ação sobre as alterações climáticas. Durante a conferência será elaborado um documento para ser enviado diretamente à Conferência da Juventude (COY 19) e à Conferência das Partes (COP 29), eventos de discussão internacionais sobre as alterações climáticas que terão lugar no Azerbaijão este ano.

""Ter um evento de incidência internacional aqui no Estado é incrível, pois é uma oportunidade para mostrarmos ao mundo os desafios que enfrentamos por aqui, como os avanços dos eventos climáticos extremos, a degradação desenfreada do Pampa e os desmontes das leis ambientais. Ao mesmo tempo, criámos as soluções colaborativamente, em conjunto com outras juventudes do Estado"", afirma Thais Yutori, ativista climática que está na organização do evento e faz parte do Eco Pelo Clima.

Para ela, a presença dos jovens gaúchos na LCOY reforça a importância do envolvimento comunitário e da colaboração em iniciativas que procuram soluções imediatas para os desafios climáticos. ""O Rio Grande do Sul tem sido altamente impactado pela crise climática. Passámos recentemente pela maior cheia já vista na história do nosso Estado, precisamos de envolver a juventude na construção das soluções que vão impactar o futuro que já é nosso"", afirma Thais.

Guterres repetiu o seu apelo para que a humanidade lute contra a sua ""dependência"" dos combustíveis fósseis.

""Hoje, o nosso foco está no impacto do calor extremo. Mas não nos esqueçamos de que há muitos outros sintomas devastadores da crise climática: furacões com violência nunca vista, inundações, secas, incêndios florestais, subida do nível do mar. E a lista continua "", afirmou.

""Para fazer frente a todos estes sintomas, precisamos combater a doença. E a doença é a loucura de incinerarmos a nossa única casa. A doença é a dependência em combustíveis fósseis. A doença é a inação climática"", reforçou, pedindo particularmente que os países do G20 entrem em ação.

Enquanto o ano de 2023 foi o mais quente de que há registo, 2024 poderá bater um novo recorde, com temperaturas bem acima dos 40ºC a serem cada vez mais comuns.

No intervalo de um ano, o limite de 50ºC foi ultrapassado em pelo menos dez locais, desde o Vale da Morte, nos Estados Unidos (53,9ºC a 7 de julho) até Agadir, em Marrocos, mas também na China, na Índia, e no Brasil.

No entanto, o calor intenso, frequentemente menos visível do que outros impactos devastadores das alterações climáticas, como tempestades e inundações, é mais mortífero.

Este ""assassino silencioso"" foi responsável por cerca de 489 mil mortes por ano entre 2000 e 2019, em comparação com as 16 mil mortes por ano provocadas por ciclones, segundo o documento ""Chamado à Ação"", publicado esta quinta-feira pelas Nações Unidas.

Os trabalhadores expostos

As temperaturas extremamente elevadas têm também impacto económico. A ONU estima que os prejuízos provocados pelo stress gerado pelo calor no trabalho atinjam os 2,4 triliões de dólares (R$ 13,5 triliões) até 2030.

Segundo um relatório da Organização Internacional do Trabalho publicado esta quinta-feira, mais de 70% dos trabalhadores estiveram expostos ao calor extremo em 2020, mais 8,8% do que no ano 2000.

""A boa notícia é que podemos salvar vidas e limitar este impacto"", disse Guterres esta quinta-feira.

A ONU pediu que a comunidade mundial atue primeiro para proteger ""os mais vulneráveis"", incluindo as crianças pequenas, os idosos e os mais pobres.

Neste contexto, os sistemas de alerta precoce deveriam incluir o calor extremo, alertas às populações sobre a chegada de ondas de calor e informá-las sobre as precauções a tomar, acrescentou o documento.

O apelo à ação recomenda ainda o ""aumento do acesso equitativo e a ampliação do arrefecimento de baixo carbono"".

Isto abrangeria investimentos em sistemas de arrefecimento passivo - que incluem medições urbanas sensíveis ao clima, superfícies reflectoras e sistemas de arrefecimento natural, bem como a eliminação de gases com efeito de estufa, utilizados em muitos sistemas de arrefecimento.

O presidente do parlamento da Crimeia, Vladimir Konstantinov, afirma que o plano apresentado por Zelensky visa privar da autodeterminação aqueles que optaram pela adesão à Rússia.

Konstantinov apelou esta sexta-feira (18) aos países ocidentais para que repudiem o chamado ""plano de vitória"" de Vladimir Zelensky, uma vez que não há nada de construtivo nas suas propostas.

Zelensky apresentou o chamado ""plano de vitória"" ao Parlamento ucraniano na quarta-feira (16), que, segundo ele, resolveria o conflito até, no máximo, 2025. O documento inclui cinco pontos e três anexos secretos.

O primeiro ponto é a Ucrânia ser convidada a aderir à Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO), o que foi de facto uma das razões da operação militar especial russa.

O segundo é a Ucrânia ser autorizada a utilizar armas de longo alcance ocidentais contra territórios russos longe da zona de conflito. O presidente da Rússia, Vladimir Putin, disse que isso significaria o envolvimento direto dos países ocidentais, uma vez que estes golpes não podem ser feitos sem a participação dos militares da NATO.

O terceiro é a implantação de um pacote abrangente não nuclear de dissuasão da Rússia em solo ucraniano.

""É tempo de o Ocidente rejeitar publicamente o plano de Zelensky. Esse plano, se assim posso dizê-lo, não contém nada de construtivo"", disse Konstantinov à Sputnik.

Segundo ele, Zelensky tem pressa em arrastar a Ucrânia para a NATO, de forma a privar a população que optou pela adesão à Rússia da oportunidade de autodeterminação.

""A nossa missão histórica é precisamente garantir a estas pessoas o direito à autodeterminação, muito semelhante ao que aconteceu em 2014 na Crimeia e em 2022 nas novas regiões russas"", acrescentou Konstantinov.

Anteriormente, a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova, comentando o ""plano de vitória"" de Zelensky, disse que este não é um plano, mas um conjunto de slogans incoerentes. Segundo Zakharova, Zelensky está apenas a empurrar a NATO para um conflito direto com a Rússia.

O porta-voz do presidente da Rússia, Dmitry Peskov, afirmou que o novo ""plano de paz"" de Zelensky pode, na verdade, repetir o plano dos EUA, que consiste em combater a Rússia até ao último ucraniano. Segundo Peskov, para alcançar a paz, Kiev deve ter ""sobriedade"" e perceber as razões que levaram ao conflito.

Anunciada há dias, a onda de calor fez com que as temperaturas ultrapassassem os 40ºC este sábado (11) em cidades do Mato Grosso e Mato Grosso do Sul. Os termómetros também registaram os efeitos do fenómeno climático na capital de São Paulo, onde fez 34,8ºC. Os dados são do Inmet (Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia), que prevê a continuidade do calor.

""A temperatura estará cinco graus Celsius acima da média por um período superior a cinco dias"", informou o Instituto Nacional de Meteorologia.

Coxim (MS) registou 41,4ºC e, em Rondonópolis (MT), os termómetros bateram os 40,4ºC. A situação era esperada e a previsão é que as duas cidades e o resto do Centro-Oeste tenham dias ainda mais quentes.

O Estado de São Paulo também será afetado. A segunda-feira (13) deverá ser o dia mais quente na capital durante a onda de calor, com uma máxima de 38ºC, segundo a previsão do Inmet. A situação deve repetir-se no interior.

As regiões de Campinas, Ribeirão Preto, Araçatuba, Marília e Araraquara estão dentro de uma ""zona de grande risco"" (temperatura alta e humidade baixa), de acordo com o Inmet. Áreas de Minas Gerais, Goiás, Mato Grosso e Mato Grosso do Sul também aparecem na lista de calor intenso.

O El Niño é apontado como um fator de contribuição para temperaturas acima da média histórica. Mas os cientistas avaliam que o cenário é também consequência das alterações climáticas.

Calor intenso e duradouro

O Inmet emitiu um aviso de nível amarelo na passada quarta-feira (8). Esta categoria é atingida quando a previsão é de temperaturas pelo menos cinco graus acima da média histórica durante dois a três dias consecutivos.

A MetSul informou que o cenário pode ser ainda mais dramático. A empresa revelou que mesmo as cidades habituadas ao calor poderão ter máximas até 15 graus acima da média para este período do ano.

O meteorologista Vinicius Lucyrio, do Climatempo, declarou que é provável o registo de recordes de temperatura para este mês nas cidades de São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Cuiabá, Palmas, Goiânia, Brasília, Belo Horizonte e Campo Grande.

As temperaturas elevadas chegaram mesmo ao Paraná, estado da região Sul, a mais fria do Brasil. Em Curitiba, fez 34ºC e Maringá registou 35,9ºC.

Mas a preocupação na região é outra porque há alerta de tempestades. As cidades do Sul têm enfrentado inundações e os municípios do Rio Grande do Sul e de Santa Catarina sofreram graves prejuízos. O cenário pode repetir-se.

""Este sábado, as áreas de instabilidade vão provocar fortes aguaceiros, com rajadas de vento acima dos 80 km/h e queda de granizo, especialmente, entre o Rio Grande do Sul e Santa Catarina"", alertou o Inmet.

O atual impasse entre a Rússia e o Ocidente poderia ter sido evitado se a NATO e os EUA se tivessem envolvido em negociações sérias sobre a exigência de garantias de segurança por parte de Moscovo, argumentou o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros húngaro, Peter Szijjarto.

Em Dezembro de 2021, dois meses antes de a Rússia lançar a sua operação militar na Ucrânia, apresentou uma lista de propostas de segurança para a NATO e os EUA, insistindo que o bloco retirasse a sua infraestrutura militar para as fronteiras de 1997.

O ponto-chave do documento era travar a expansão da NATO, particularmente em relação à Ucrânia, que há muito procurava juntar-se ao bloco militar. No entanto, o bloco rejeitou a proposta, alegando a sua ""política de portas abertas"" para novos membros.

Em entrevista à RIA Novosti este sábado (12), o chefe da diplomacia húngara sugeriu que os termos russos poderiam ter servido de base para evitar o conflito na Ucrânia.

""Lembro-me desses tempos. Acho que o que faltava era uma discussão séria [...]. Acredito que, se alguém tem um problema [...], deve ser discutido. E essas discussões não ocorreram, infelizmente"", disse o diplomata.

Szijjarto reconheceu que qualquer debate sobre o que poderia ter acontecido é agora irrelevante, mas sublinhou que desejava ""que estes diálogos tivessem ocorrido. Porque se tivessem acontecido, talvez não estivéssemos na situação em que nos encontramos agora"".

O apresentador de televisão britânico Jeremy Clarkson afirmou que Greta Thunberg é uma adolescente “idiota” que está a desviar a atenção dos jovens sobre o universo dos automóveis.

O polémico apresentador, que é um dos rostos do programa de automóveis 'The Grand Tour', juntamente com Richard Hammond e James May, considerou que a jovem ativista está a defender uma causa perdida e que é responsável pela perda de interesse dos jovens por programas de TV como aquele que co-apresenta.

“Todos os jovens que conheço com menos de 25 jovens não têm o mais pequeno interesse em carros. A Greta Thunberg está a matar os programas televisivos sobre automóveis”, disse Jeremy Clarkson, em declarações ao jornal “The Sun”.

“Eles são ensinados desde a escola, antes de dizerem 'Papá e Mamã, que os carros são o diabo, e isso fica na cabeça deles”, acrescentou o apresentador, em jeito de ironia.

Richard Hammond, outro dos apresentadores do programa 'The Grand Tour', também disse concordar com o seu colega. “Odeio ter que dizer isto, mas penso que o Jeremy está certo. Os mais novos já não se interessam por carros. Quantas crianças estão a crescer com posters de automóveis nas paredes dos seus quartos?”, questionou o apresentador.

Esta não é a primeira vez que Jeremy Clarkson critica a jovem ativista que defende mais medidas contra as alterações climáticas. Ainda no mês passado, o apresentador escreveu na coluna semanal que tem no “The Sun”, que Greta Thunberg é uma “criança mimada” que devia ser uma “boa menina e calar-se”, assim como voltar à escola, criticando também a educação dada pelos pais.

“Quando disseste à tua mãe e pai que querias deixar de andar de avião e comer carne, eles não se comportaram como pais saudáveis ignorando-te, pelo contrário. Eles disseram.

PT_73.txt,Other,Other,"Ucrânia já recebeu os F-16 ocidentais mas Zelensky garante que são insuficientes

A Ucrânia recebeu os seus primeiros caças F-16 ocidentais, esperados há mais de dois anos, anunciou hoje o Presidente Volodymyr Zelensky, mostrando-os a jornalistas e sublinhando que o seu número é “insuficiente”.

“Realizámos centenas de reuniões e negociações” com os aliados para obter estes aviões e reforçar a defesa aérea do país e “muitas vezes ouvimos as palavras ‘é impossível’ em resposta”, disse Volodymyr Zelensky, durante uma cerimónia num local secreto na Ucrânia, segundo avança a AFP.

“Agora é a realidade, a realidade no nosso céu. Os F-16 estão na Ucrânia”, disse.

Desde o início da invasão russa, em fevereiro de 2022, Kiev tem implorado pela entrega de F-16 na esperança de acabar com o domínio russo no ar e proteger melhor as suas cidades e militares contra incessantes bombardeamentos das forças de Moscovo.

Fabricados nos Estados Unidos, os aviões são considerados a joia da coroa na extensa lista de equipamento militar que a Ucrânia solicitou aos aliados, numa tentativa de repelir o avanço das forças russas no seu solo.

O Presidente da Ucrânia não revelou o número de aeronaves recebidas por Kiev, limitando-se a dizer que é “insuficiente”, assim como o número de pilotos ucranianos treinados no Ocidente para pilotar aquelas aeronaves.

Também não foram revelados a data de entrega e o país que forneceu este primeiro lote.

“O que é positivo é que esperamos mais F-16” e que “muitos dos nossos homens estão a ser treinados”, assegurou Zelensky.

Jornalistas da AFP viram pelo menos dois F-16 a sobrevoar o local durante a cerimónia.

Atrás de Volodymyr Zelensky, outras duas aeronaves cinzentas semelhantes a F-16 foram colocadas no solo, parcialmente cobertas por redes de camuflagem e com as caudas estampadas com o brasão nacional, o tridente.

Em meados de maio, o presidente Zelensky declarou, numa entrevista à AFP, que precisava de 120 a 130 destas aeronaves para alcançar a paridade com a aviação russa.

Ao realizarem testes em humanos, as grandes farmacêuticas não pensaram duas vezes antes de utilizar os hospitais de certos países em desenvolvimento, sem ""controlos rigorosos"" para tais ações, disse à Sputnik William Jones, antigo correspondente da Casa Branca e membro não residente do Instituto Chongyang para Estudos Financeiros.

Recentemente, a Sputnik obteve uma série de documentos que indicam que os medicamentos reumatológicos foram alegadamente testados durante vários anos em doentes psiquiátricos de um hospital da cidade de Mariupol, a pedido das grandes empresas farmacêuticas ocidentais e com a assistência das autoridades ucranianas.

Os documentos contêm informações pertencentes a empresas como a Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Celltrion, Novatris International AG, Merck KGaA e uma filial da Samsung que produz equipamentos médicos. Os testes foram realizados enquanto o governo de Kiev mantinha Mariupol, até maio de 2022, quando a Rússia assumiu o controlo da cidade.

Os pacientes da ala psiquiátrica do hospital № 7 de Mariupol foram provavelmente usados como ""cobaias"" vulneráveis em experiências que não teriam sido permitidas nos países onde estas empresas farmacêuticas estão localizadas, disse William Jones, ex-correspondente na Casa Branca da Executive Intelligence Review e bolseiro não residente do Instituto Chongyang de Estudos Financeiros, Universidade Renmin da China, disse à Sputnik.

""Em geral, tem sido prática utilizar alguns dos países em desenvolvimento que não têm controlos tão rigorosos para este tipo de experiências"", observou Jones, aludindo à Ucrânia.

Após o golpe de Maidan em Kiev, em 2014, o país ""tornou-se efetivamente uma 'cobaia' para quaisquer experiências que as forças das elites ocidentais lhes reservassem, como vemos de forma mais dramática na forma como a 'nação' da Ucrânia está a ser reduzida a nada por causa da guerra por procuração da NATO contra a Rússia"", segundo o especialista.

Abordou ainda a questão da ""extensa rede de laboratórios biológicos que foram criados na Ucrânia ao longo dos 20 anos, em grande parte com a ajuda, e sem dúvida a pedido, dos Estados Unidos"", algo que Jones recordou ter sido repetidamente apontado pelo tenente-general Igor Kirillov, chefe das Tropas de Defesa Radiológica, Química e Biológica do Ministério da Defesa russo.

""Dada a atual situação na Ucrânia, com a crescente compreensão de que a Ucrânia — ou a NATO — não pode 'vencer' este conflito utilizando armas convencionais, bem como a determinação da NATO em não aceitar uma resolução pacífica a menos que a Rússia seja derrotada, poderia muito bem levar à utilização de alguma forma de guerra biológica por parte da NATO para 'equilibrar o campo de jogo'"", alertou Jones.

Na primavera europeia de 2022, as Tropas de Defesa Radiológica, Química e Biológica da Rússia trouxeram luz ao alcance alarmante das atividades biomilitares dos EUA que ocorrem em vários locais da Ucrânia. Estas investigações revelaram a colaboração entre Washington e Kiev na investigação e tratamento de vários agentes patogénicos altamente perigosos. Posteriormente, várias destas descobertas foram corroboradas de forma independente.

O limite do Acordo de Paris não era realista. Pensemos bem sobre ficar abaixo de uma temperatura quando já a ultrapassámos.

Acordo Paris, 1,5°C. Esta sequência tem sido repetida inúmeras vezes ao longo dos últimos anos, já que o referido acordo estabeleceu que todos os Governos iriam unir-se para manter o aquecimento global abaixo dos 1,5 ºC.

Esse tratado internacional, que entrou em vigor há praticamente oito anos, foi visto como uma grande vitória no combate às alterações climáticas.

Mas rapidamente se verificou que esse não é um cenário realista. Quer por causa do avanço industrial, ou por causa da ininterrupta poluição, quer por causa do que diz a própria ciência.

É que, no debate sobre os limites da temperatura, reparamos que essa meta só seria conquistada daqui a (muitos) anos. E que, antes de recuarmos a níveis abaixo do 1,5°C., já a teríamos ultrapassado.

Ou seja, iríamos superar esse limite para, décadas depois, voltar a ficar abaixo. Iríamos remover carbono da atmosfera e reduzir novamente as temperaturas.

Isso não é solução.

A “máquina do tempo” é uma fantasia, resume o El Confidencial.

Um novo estudo mostra que essa reversão é um “excesso de confiança” no combate às alterações climáticas.

Muitos impactos das alterações climáticas são irreversíveis, em resumo.

A temperatura média global à superfície até pode descer, mas as condições climáticas regionais não seguirão necessariamente a tendência global e poderão acabar por ser diferentes das anteriores. Exemplo: o Oceano Atlântico ou o Antártico continuam a aquecer, enquanto o resto do planeta não.

Um dano ocorrido durante o período acima do limite seria permanente. A nível cronológico, um agricultor vai ficar descansado se pensar que, daqui a 100 anos, o seu campo pode – e é apenas uma possibilidade – produzir como ele queria?

E ainda surge a dúvida sobre como retirar carbono à escala planetária. Para plantar árvores ou culturas energéticas suficientes para reduzir as temperaturas globais, seriam precisos continentes cheios de… terra. Só.

A captura directa de gigatoneladas de carbono do ar consumiria enormes quantidades de energia renovável e, assim, competiria com a descarbonização.

Não há terra suficiente para tudo isto. Não há como fugir das consequências graves deste consumo excessivo de energia.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears']","['CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Whatever we do it is already too late']",alteração climática máquina mito limite acordo Paris realista penser ficar abaixo temperatura ultrapassár acordo Paris c. sequência ser repetir inúmero longo último ano referir acordo estabelecer governo ir unirr se manter aquecimento global abaixo c. tratado internacional entrar vigor haver praticamente ano ver vitória combate alteração climática rapidamente verificar cenário realista causa avanço industrial causa ininterrupta poluição causa próprio ciência debate limite temperatura reparar meta conquistar de aqui ano recuarr nível abaixo c. teríar ultrapassar ser iríamos superar limite década voltar ficar abaixo iríamos remover carbono atmosfera reduzir novamente temperatura solução máquina fantasia resumar El confidencial estudo mostrar reversão excesso confiança combate alteração climática impacto alteração climática irreversível resumo temperatura médio global superfície descer condição climática regional seguir necessariamente tendência global poder acabar diferentes anterior oceano atlântico antártico continuar aquecer resto planeta dano ocorrer durante período acima limite permanente cronológico agricultor ficar descansar pensar de aqui ano campo possibilidade produzir querer surgir dúvida retirar carbono escala planetário plantar árvore cultura energética suficiente reduzir temperatura global ser preciso continente cheio terra captura directo gigatonelada carbono ar consumiriar enorme quantidade energia renovável competir descarbonização haver terra suficiente haver fugir consequência grave consumo excessivo energia

Estão juntos na Homofobia e na Xenofobia, mas em polos completamente opostos no que toca à Invasão da Ucrânia, o que não é novidade no que toca aos apoiantes do Chega, não fosse o partido de André Ventura, o partido das contradições.

Mário Machado, um neo-nazi assumido que possui uma longa ficha criminal envolvendo ofensas corporais, posse de armas ilegais,  sequestro e extorsão, entre outras coisas menos recomendáveis, decidiu viajar até à Ucrânia para se juntar às milícias neo-nazis que fazem parte da Guarda Nacional Ucraniana e que apoiam e são por sua vez apoiadas e sustentadas pelo presidente Zelensky no conflito armado contra a Rússia. E nunca é demais sublinhar tudo aquilo que as televisões mentirosas e corruptas se escusam a noticiar em relação a este batalhão neo-nazi que segue, desde 2014, acusado por crimes de guerra contra populações civis no Leste da Ucrânia, nomeadamente em casos de tortura, violações, saques e todas essas coisas «fofinhas» que os nazis gostam imenso de fazer!

E para que o referido Mário Machado possa deixar Portugal na companhia de mais vinte comparsas, um juiz (é verdade, um juiz do Tribunal Central de Instrução Criminal) dispensou-o de se apresentar quinzenalmente na esquadra, na sequência de mais um processo onde é arguido, para ele se deslocar livremente até à Ucrânia, onde alegadamente irá por «razões humanitárias»!

Eu sou uma mulher conservadora e de Direita, sou (com muita honra e muito orgulho) Deputada Municipal no Concelho de Cascais por um conhecido partido de Direita, sou anti-socialista e anti-comunista assumida, tenho o maior desprezo pelo progressismo de Esquerda, assim como pelo Marxismo-Cultural e pelo Globalismo e fico pasma quando vejo um juiz português conceder semelhante privilégio a um conhecido neo-nazi que vai viajar para um país estrangeiro a fim de se juntar a um grupo de gente que acredita e defende uma ideologia hedionda, responsável pela morte de tantos milhões de pessoas e que nessa «arte» de matar apenas foi suplantada pelo maldito comunismo!

É de tal maneira enviesada e doentia esta determinação imposta pela NATO, pela UE, pela ONU e pelos malditos globalistas no sentido de formatar o mundo contra a Rússia e contra o seu presidente (e eu não apoio nem uma, nem o outro, tal como não apoio a Ucrânia nem o presidente ucraniano) que assistimos a este tipo de coisas inenarráveis sem que a maioria da população se indigne com semelhante procedimento, porque afinal o Mário Machado que é neo-nazi, também é muito humano e muito fofinho só porque vai ajudar os amigalhaços neo-nazis lá da Ucrânia!

Em janeiro deste ano, mais de um milhão de hectares foram queimados no Brasil, de acordo com os dados do Monitor do Fogo, na plataforma do MapBiomas. Segundo informações da Agência Brasil, isto representa uma área equivalente a dez vezes o tamanho do Estado de Sergipe.

Os números mostram um crescimento de 248% face a janeiro de 2023. Foram 287 mil hectares ardidos, em janeiro de 2023, contra 1,03 milhões de hectares, em janeiro de 2024. A seca extrema e a redução da chuva foram fatores que contribuíram para este aumento.

Alerta de colapso parcial na Amazónia em 2050

Um artigo científico liderado por investigadores brasileiros e publicado na revista Nature alerta para uma possível redução significativa da cobertura florestal da região da Amazónia até 2050, caso não sejam tomadas medidas urgentes. Financiado pelo Instituto Serrapilheira, o estudo realça a importância de combater a desflorestação e promover a restauração ecológica como medidas essenciais para evitar um colapso parcial da floresta. Além disso, sublinha a necessidade de uma governação global eficaz na mitigação das alterações climáticas.

Datas importantes como o Dia Mundial da Água (22/3), o Dia Mundial do Planeta Terra (22/4), o Dia Mundial do Ambiente (5/6), o Dia da Árvore (21/9), o Dia do Rio (24/11) e tantas outras foram instituídas para sensibilizar a sociedade para a urgência da preservação dos recursos naturais e garantir um futuro sustentável para as próximas gerações.

SOS TERRA

“Salve o planeta, você que tem poder. Salvemos a Mãe Terra, não há tempo a perder”, este é o clamor das crianças e jovens assistidos pela Legião da Boa Vontade (LBV) para a preservação do Ambiente. A iniciativa integra as mais diversas ações socioeducativas desenvolvidas pela Instituição nas suas dezenas de unidades socioeducativas espalhadas pelo país. As palavras fazem parte do videoclipe SOS Terra.

A propósito, “Educar. Preservar. Sobreviver. Humanamente também somos Natureza” é um dos lemas da LBV inspirado nas teses do seu presidente, o jornalista, escritor e educador José de Paiva Netto, cuja temática é desenvolvida permanentemente nas atividades socioambientais da Entidade.

Cuida da terra

Por isso, este mês em que celebramos o Dia Mundial do Ambiente (5) é uma oportunidade para refletirmos acerca deste importante recado das crianças apoiadas pela LBV na composição Cuida Terra, que recebeu o “Prémio Hugo Werneck de Sustentabilidade & Amor à Natureza” , considerado o “Óscar da Ecologia”, na categoria “Melhor canção”, na sua 12.ª edição promovida pela revista Ecológico (2021).

As duas composições são da autoria do professor e músico Nilton Duarte, que atua no Conjunto Educacional Boa Vontade, em São Paulo/SP, e são belamente interpretadas pelas crianças e pelos jovens atendidos na Instituição.

O embaixador russo em Lisboa referiu que Portugal e outros países europeus deviam ponderar a iniciativa do Presidente Vladimir Putin para construir na Eurásia ""uma arquitetura de segurança igual e indivisível"" em vez de ""participar na aventura russófoba imprudente"".

A propósito da celebração neste sábado, em Lisboa, do 33.º aniversário da independência da Ucrânia, Mikhail Kamynin divulgou uma comunicação na qual defendeu que ""em vez de participar na aventura russófoba imprudente de Washington e da NATO, Portugal e outros países da UE (União Europeia) devem ponderar seriamente a iniciativa do Presidente da Rússia Vladimir Putin que visa construir na Eurásia 'uma arquitetura de segurança igual e indivisível'"".

Na mensagem divulgada no 'site' da embaixada, Kamynin referiu que com os ""recentes ataques contra a região de Kursk (na Rússia), a Ucrânia voltou a sabotar uma eventual resolução do conflito"", argumentando ainda que Portugal tem responsabilidade na ""futura escalada"".

""Envio incessante de armas ocidentais ao regime ucraniano, incluindo as caças F-16, também agrava a situação. Lisboa que participa no fornecimento das armas letais a Kiev e na preparação do pessoal de manutenção dos aviões mencionados, responsabiliza-se, junto com outros 'patrocinadores' de Zelensky, pela futura escalada do conflito"", afirmou.

Para o embaixador russo, ""33 anos depois da independência a sociedade ucraniana está mais dividida do que nunca, enquanto a Ucrânia ficou obrigada a servidão por dívida face aos Estados Unidos e 'parceiros' da UE"".

""Lamento muito que uma das mais desenvolvidas repúblicas da União Soviética tenha sido tanto devastada"", concluiu.

A Ucrânia comemora hoje a sua independência da União Soviética, numa altura em que a guerra com Moscovo se arrasta pelo terceiro ano.

A celebração do Dia da Ucrânia acontece num momento em que as forças ucranianas têm em curso, desde 06 de agosto, uma ofensiva terrestre sem precedentes na região fronteiriça russa de Kursk, ao mesmo tempo que tentam conter os avanços das tropas de Moscovo na província de Donetsk, no leste do país.

Em Kursk, as autoridades ucranianas reclamam o controlo de mais de 90 localidades.

Desde o início da ofensiva ucraniana, mais de 130.000 pessoas fugiram dos combates e dos bombardeamentos, segundo as autoridades da região de Kursk. Pelo menos 31 civis foram mortos e 143 ficaram feridos, de acordo com a agência noticiosa estatal russa TASS.

A ofensiva militar russa no território ucraniano, lançada a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, mergulhou a Europa naquela que é considerada a crise de segurança mais grave desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945).

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais desde que a Rússia invadiu o país.

O ""plano de vitória"" de Vladimir Zelensky não contribuirá para o fim do conflito na Ucrânia, escreve num artigo para a Fox News a ex-oficial dos serviços de informação norte-americanos Rebekah Koffler.

A autora fundamenta a sua posição com uma série de razões, entre as quais a falta de compreensão clara por parte de Kiev do que deveria ser a vitória e o facto de menosprezar a situação operacional na frente de combate.

""A Rússia está gradual, mas seguramente a avançar no campo de batalha"", explica a analista. A mesma lembrou ainda que ""a mudança da situação atual é uma tarefa fundamental que a Ucrânia não é capaz de realizar"" devido à quantidade insuficiente de meios.

""O número de mísseis táticos de longo alcance (ATACMS) entregues à Ucrânia é insuficiente para o alcance deste objetivo. Nem os EUA, nem a Europa têm reservas adicionais ou capacidade de produção para aumentar rapidamente os seus arsenais esgotados"", alertou Koffler.

A especialista observou, ainda, que o ""plano de vitória"" de Zelensky não é nada que possa ter qualquer influência nos acontecimentos em curso, acrescentando que o Exército russo excede o ucraniano em número de tropas e equipamento tecnológico.

Recentemente, o chefe do regime de Kiev reuniu-se com o presidente dos EUA, Joe Biden, a fim de mostrar o seu ""plano de vitória"" e obter permissão para usar mísseis ocidentais de longo alcance para atingir a Rússia em profundidade, mas a Casa Branca, após as conversações, não anunciou quaisquer alterações na sua abordagem para permitir a utilização destes mísseis por Kiev.

O poder suave da Rússia no combate à hegemonia dos EUA na América Latina ""é bem-sucedido"", disse o historiador e analista internacional Daniel Trujillo Sanz à Sputnik ao comentar a mensagem anual do presidente russo, Vladimir Putin.

Na sua mensagem anual à Assembleia Federal desta quinta-feira (29), Putin defendeu o reforço das relações com os países da América Latina. Acrescentou que é importante que a Rússia procure novos pontos de convergência e aprofunde todo o leque de parcerias, especialmente com os homólogos árabes e sul-americanos.

Quanto ao discurso do presidente, Sanz indicou que ""assistimos a um discurso sóbrio, conciso e direto do presidente Putin, como sempre, claramente estruturado"". O analista fez um paralelismo entre as palavras do chefe de Estado russo e dos líderes ocidentais, ""cujos critérios parecem mudar todos os dias"".

""Podemos referir-nos ao [presidente francês Emmanuel] Macron como exemplo. Um dia lidera uma rebelião contra a NATO [Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte], noutro dia propõe enviar forças francesas para a Ucrânia e praticamente desencadear uma guerra"", enfatizou.

O analista deu ainda outros exemplos do primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, e do presidente turco, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, com a entrada da Finlândia e da Suécia na NATO. Além disso, chamou a atenção para a atitude da Alemanha ""em relação à terrível e gravíssima sabotagem que sofreu no seu interesse nacional com a explosão do Nord Stream"".

Ainda sobre a América Latina, Sanz acrescentou que é necessário admitir que os Estados Unidos ""continuam a ter hegemonia ou pelo menos primazia neste aspeto"".

""A cultura, a música, o estilo de vida e o vestuário foram claramente estabelecidos durante a era da globalização e, nesse aspeto, a Rússia tem de ultrapassar décadas de influência, especialmente no continente latino-americano e noutras partes do mundo. Considero absolutamente necessário para que a Rússia comece a entrar nesta luta, apesar das dificuldades que vão enfrentar.""

Neste dia 29 de fevereiro, Vladimir Putin comunicou a sua mensagem anual à Assembleia Federal. O presidente fez um balanço da situação do país e traçou as principais linhas de ação na política interna e externa para os próximos seis anos.

O calor deverá impossibilitar a vida humana em pelo menos cinco regiões da Terra nos próximos 50 anos, incluindo no Brasil, aponta um estudo da Agência Espacial Norte-americana (Nasa).

A investigação considerou que o aumento da temperatura somado a elevados índices de humidade do ar pode provocar efeitos térmicos aos quais o corpo humano não se conseguiria adaptar.

A emissão de gases com efeito de estufa impacta diretamente a natureza, com alterações climáticas cada vez mais aceleradas e severas em todo o planeta. A subida da temperatura torna frequente as ondas de calor fora de época e os invernos menos intensos ou com períodos mais curtos do que o habitual.

Segundo a NASA, o processo de arrefecimento do corpo acontece a partir da transpiração, ou seja, do suor. O aumento da temperatura combinado com a humidade eleva a sensação de calor e evita que o suor evapore, o que mantém o corpo quente – e pode ser fatal.

O estudo indica que os termómetros acima dos 37ºC – marca ultrapassada em muitas regiões do Brasil durante o verão – com humidade do ar igual ou superior a 70% podem provocar a morte precoce até seis horas de exposição.

O corpo consegue ainda suar com 45ºC de temperatura e até 20% de humidade do ar. No entanto, a investigação projeta que com o termómetro na mesma marca e um índice de humidade acima dos 40% a sensação térmica pode ultrapassar os 71ºC e ser letal.

Apesar da combinação destes fatores ser considerada rara, uma vez que os dias de calor se caracterizam por apresentarem um ar mais seco, o estudo constatou que desde 2005 o fenómeno é observado em regiões do Golfo Pérsico e do Paquistão.

Neste cenário, a NASA considerou a tendência de aumento dos termómetros nas próximas décadas, com as alterações climáticas impulsionadas pela emissão de gases com efeito de estufa, e concluiu que a vida humana pode estar ameaçada em áreas do centro-oeste, norte, nordeste e sudeste brasileiro.

""Os planos da minoria ocidental de isolar a Rússia e criar uma espécie de cordão sanitário em nosso redor fracassaram. Os próprios promotores destas iniciativas são forçados a admiti-lo"", disse Serguei Lavrov, durante uma intervenção na Duma estatal russa (câmara baixa do parlamento), citado pela agência noticiosa oficial TASS.

Na intervenção, Lavrov considerou que o Ocidente, liderado pelos Estados Unidos, utilizou o ""regime de Kiev"" para garantir esses objetivos, para além de ter disponibilizado ""um amplo arsenal de ferramentas de guerra híbrida"", incluindo sanções económicas e diplomáticas, que também abrangeram os setores da informação, da cultura e do desporto.

No entanto, sublinhou que a ""hostilidade coletiva"" do Ocidente também permitiu o surgimento de ""novas oportunidades"" para dirigir as relações da Rússia até ""diversas direções geográficas"", dando como exemplo a China e África, que se converteu ""num dos polos do multipolar emergente"".

Lavrov, que visitará na próxima semana Cuba, Venezuela e Brasil, assinalou que no decurso da sua passagem pelo Rio de Janeiro na quarta e quinta-feira -- onde vai participar na cimeira dos ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros do G20 (as 20 maiores economias do mundo) - a Rússia irá continuar a opor-se a ""objetivos egoístas"" que surgiram no grupo, incluindo ""a 'ucranização' da agenda"".

Ainda em relação à Ucrânia, Lavrov voltou a assinalar que existe predisposição da Rússia para iniciar negociações, desde que se respeitem os seus ""interesses legítimos"", totalmente contraditórios com as reivindicações ucranianas, empenhadas na recuperação da totalidade do território.

Estas palavras do ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo seguem-se a declarações de outras fontes russas que, na terça-feira, asseguraram que a sugestão do Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, de um cessar-fogo na Ucrânia e negociações, após contactos em dezembro passado entre intermediários, foi rejeitada pelos Estados Unidos da América (EUA).

Uma fonte oficial dos EUA negou sob anonimato que tenha havido qualquer contacto formal e disse que Washington não se envolveria em negociações que excluíssem a Ucrânia.

A ofensiva militar russa no território ucraniano, desencadeada em 24 de fevereiro de 2022, mergulhou a Europa naquela que é considerada a crise de segurança mais grave desde a Segunda Guerra Mundial (1939-1945).

Os aliados ocidentais da Ucrânia têm fornecido armas a Kiev e aprovado sucessivos pacotes de sanções contra interesses russos para tentar diminuir a capacidade de Moscovo de financiar o esforço de guerra.

O Rei Carlos III, do Reino Unido, que tem realizado durante toda a sua vida campanhas sobre questões ambientais, instalou painéis solares no Castelo de Windsor e planeia converter os carros Bentley da família real britânica para que funcionem com biocombustível, informaram as autoridades do palácio.

Charles instalou painéis solares em parte da propriedade do Castelo de Windsor conhecida como Lord Chamberlain's Upper Store, substituindo o telhado de chumbo existente. O plano será adicionar mais painéis no futuro, disseram as autoridades.

A família real tem limusinas Bentley, que serão convertidas para funcionar com biocombustível no próximo ano, como etapa provisória antes de a frota se tornar elétrica, disseram as autoridades. Há muito que o rei se manifesta abertamente sobre a conservação ambiental e, em 2020, descreveu o aquecimento global e as alterações climáticas como a maior ameaça que a humanidade já enfrentou.

As autoridades do palácio forneceram as informações enquanto explicavam os detalhes do relatório anual sobre as receitas e despesas financiadas pelos contribuintes, conhecido como Subsídio Soberano.

O documento mostrou que as despesas oficiais para 2023-24 foram de 89,1 milhões de libras (106,4 milhões de euros), acima dos 86,3 milhões de libras alocados, obrigando a casa real a mergulhar nas reservas para financiar o défice, embora menos do que no ano passado.

No total, os custos de viagem ascenderam a 4,2 milhões de libras, sendo que a maior despesa no estrangeiro foi a visita de Estado do rei e da rainha ao Quénia, que custou 167 mil libras.

Kiev terá enviado 120 mil soldados para a fronteira. “Perante a política agressiva” da Ucrânia, “introduzimos as nossas forças armadas ao longo de toda a fronteira. Em caso de guerra, serão a defesa”, diz Lukashenko.

Duas semanas depois de atravessarem a fronteira e pisarem território russo na região fronteiriça de Kursk, as tropas ucranianas estão a reunir na fronteira com a Bielorrússia, segundo o presidente do país — o maior aliado do Kremlin.

Alexander Lukashenko afirma, segundo a agência noticiosa estatal do país, que Kiev enviou mais de 120 mil soldados para a zona fronteiriça.

Em resposta, Minsk destacou quase um terço das suas forças armadas ao longo da fronteira. Se a Ucrânia tentar entrar em território bielorrusso, Lukashenko não vai ficar a ver.

“Perante a política agressiva” da Ucrânia, “introduzimos em certos pontos as nossas forças armadas ao longo de toda a fronteira. Em caso de guerra, serão a defesa“, afirmou Lukashenko em entrevista à televisão estatal russa, citada pela BelTA e Al Jazeera., sem avançar exatamente quantos soldados foram destacados.

O exército da Bielorrússia tem cerca de 48.000 soldados e cerca de 12.000 efectivos nas fronteiras do Estado, de acordo com a avaliação The Military Balance 2022 do Instituto Internacional de Estudos Estratégicos.

A 7 de outubro, o Tenente-General Igor Kirillov, o chefe das tropas de proteção radiológica, química e biológica das Forças Armadas da Federação da Rússia, no seu briefing, alertou para os preparativos de Kiev para uma provocação com utilização de armas químicas, proibidas a nível internacional. Esta intervenção do representante do Ministério da Defesa da Rússia não teve cobertura no espaço mediático português, o que, mais uma vez, demonstra a abordagem parcial e seletiva dos meios de comunicação locais à formação da agenda de notícias.

No entanto, as declarações feitas há dois dias visam prevenir a catástrofe de grande escala, que pode causar danos irreversíveis à saúde dos civis, e exigem a máxima divulgação pública.

A Rússia sabe com certeza que, nos últimos meses, o regime de Zelensky, com o apoio dos países da NATO, tem preparado a provocação com o propósito de acusar o exército russo da utilização dos agentes venenosos e, como consequência disso, da violação da Convenção sobre a Proibição das Armas Químicas. Para esse efeito os EUA e os seus satélites ensinam os funcionários dos serviços secretos ucranianos a falsificar a base de evidência (tais provocações encenadas foram, por exemplo, levadas a cabo na Síria) e fornecem-lhes o equipamento técnico necessário.

Através de tais provocações “sob o pavilhão de um país terceiro” Kiev conta atrair a atenção do público internacional para si próprio, reforçar a pressão anti-russa e receber ajuda adicional da parte dos Estados ocidentais. Ao mesmo tempo, estes países cedem à chantagem ucraniana cegamente a procurar infligir uma “derrota estratégica” a Moscovo a qualquer custo. Tal narrativa persiste até hoje apesar do crescimento da dinâmica do avanço das tropas russas na zona da realização da operação militar especial.

Jorge Moreira da Silva, ministro do Ambiente que criou este imposto, lamenta que o mesmo não esteja a ser bem aplicado

O preço dos combustíveis deve prosseguir uma lógica de aumento, e em grande parte isso deve-se ao descongelamento da taxa de carbono, um imposto criado em 2014 pelo então ministro do Ambiente, Ordenamento do Território e Energia do governo de Pedro Passos Coelho, Jorge Moreira da Silva.

Agora subsecretário-geral das Nações Unidas, o português relembra que foi precisamente ele a criar essa taxa, que continua a defender como uma medida de combate às alterações climáticas, mas que garante que está a ser mal aplicada em Portugal.

Na CNN Portugal Summit dedicada à Economia Verde, Jorge Moreira da Silva afirmou que “a fiscalidade verde é violada todos os anos desde 2014”, apontando que, com isso, quem mais perde são os portugueses.

“Eu introduzi a taxa de carbono em 2014, a fiscalidade verde é violada todos os anos desde 2014”, referiu, lamentando que os sucessivos governos, até aqui todos liderados por António Costa, não tenham dado seguimento ao cumprimento da lei.

É que, segundo diz a proposta criada por Jorge Moreira da Silva, é obrigatório haver neutralidade fiscal, o que significa que “todas as receitas geradas pelos impostos ambientais, nomeadamente a taxa de carbono, teriam de dar origem a uma redução da fiscalidade sobre o trabalho e sobre as empresas”.

Com efeito, e segundo se pode ler no artigo 50.º, que versa sobre a ""evolução da reforma da fiscalidade verde"", a receita alcançada com a criação de impostos ambientais ""deve permitir reduzir outros impostos, nomeadamente os que incidem sobre o rendimento de pessoas singulares e de pessoas coletivas"".

""O Governo deve adotar medidas que permitam acompanhar o impacto económico e ambiental das medidas implementadas através da presente lei"", lê-se ainda na mesma lei.

Na prática, o objetivo era dar incentivos fiscais às pessoas para que se atingisse a eficiência energética, numa medida que, lamenta o ex-ministro, só “funcionou um ano”.

“Teria de funcionar todos os anos. Temos mais de mil milhões de euros da taxa de carbono que não foram devolvidos aos cidadãos com a redução de IRS”, reiterou.

De resto, na apresentação desta medida ao Parlamento, precisamente em 2014, Jorge Moreira da SIlva indicava que ""a fiscalidade verde não aumenta impostos, substitui impostos"", pelo que ""a neutralidade fiscal nunca foi uma mera hipótese"", mas antes um ""pressuposto"".

""Sem a garantia de neutralidade fiscal - isto é, de utilização da receita da fiscalidade verde para desagravar outros impostos - não haveria reforma da fiscalidade verde"", acrescentou.

Este cenário não permite uma melhor transição, já que, na prática, as políticas públicas não funcionam. “Achamos que Portugal é um país fantástico, é, mas somos um mau exemplo em eficiência energética, deitamos pela janela energia e água”, terminou.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments', 'CC: Criticism of climate policies: Climate policies are ineffective']",milhão taxa carbono devolvir português fiscalidade verde violar ano Jorge Moreira Silva ministro ambiente criar imposto lamentar estar aplicar preço combustível prosseguir lógico aumento dever se descongelamento taxa carbono imposto criar ministro ambiente ordenamento território energia governo Pedro passo Coelho Jorge Moreira Silva subsecretário-geral nação unir português relembrar precisamente criar taxa continuar defender medida combate alteração climática garantir aplicar Portugal cnn Portugal summit dedicar economia verde Jorge Moreira Silva afirmar fiscalidade verde violar ano apontar perder português introduzir taxa carbono fiscalidade verde violar ano referir lamentar sucessivo governo liderar antónio Costa ter dar seguimento cumprimento lei proposta criar Jorge Moreira Silva obrigatório haver neutralidade fiscal significar receita gerar imposto ambiental nomeadamente taxa carbono ter origem redução fiscalidade trabalho empresa efeito ler artigo versa evolução reforma fiscalidade verde receita alcançar criação imposto ambiental permitir reduzir imposto nomeadamente incidir rendimento pessoa singular pessoa coletivo governo adotar medida permitir acompanhar impacto económico ambiental medida implementar presente lei lê-se mesmo lei prática objetivo incentivo fiscal pessoa atingir eficiência energético medida lamentar ex-ministro funcionar ano ter funcionar ano milhão euro taxa carbono devolvir cidadão redução irs reiterar resto apresentação medida parlamento precisamente Jorge Moreira Silva indicar fiscalidade verde aumentar imposto substituir imposto neutralidade fiscal mero hipótese pressuposto garantia neutralidade fiscal utilização receita fiscalidade verde desagravar imposto haver reforma fiscalidade verde acrescentar cenário permitir bom transição prática política público funcionar achar Portugal país fantástico mau eficiência energético deitar janela energia água terminar

As multas decretadas pelos tribunais aos activistas climáticos sucedem-se, mas desta vez há um valor mais alto em cima da mesa: o estudante que atirou tinta verde a Luís Montenegro durante a campanha eleitoral poderá ter de pagar 1750 euros de indemnização ao actual primeiro-ministro pelo fato Hugo Boss que ficou danificado, além de indemnizações a outras pessoas por danos causados.

A 28 de Fevereiro, o estudante de 19 anos, ligado ao colectivo Greve Climática Estudantil (GCE), atirou tinta verde contra o então candidato da coligação Aliança Democrática para exigir um plano para o “Fim ao Fóssil” até 2030. De acordo com um comunicado da GCE, Vicente Fernandes vai ser ouvido na tarde desta quarta-feira no Campus da Justiça, numa segunda audiência onde serão ouvidas as suas testemunhas.

A Greve Climática Estudantil convocou uma vigília à porta do Campus da Justiça, em solidariedade com o estudante.

Tinta “lavável e ecológica”

Na primeira audiência, que teve lugar a 9 de Outubro, Luís Montenegro pediu uma indemnização de 1750 euros por danos causados ao seu fato. Isabel Santiago, a fotógrafa do então candidato, pede mais de 450 euros de indemnização, e um agente da polícia pediu ainda uma indemnização por danos na roupa, alegando não ter conseguido retirar as manchas de tinta apesar das lavagens, segundo noticiou a agência Lusa.

Vicente Fernandes, que antes de atirar tinta ao actual primeiro-ministro gritou “Montenegro defende a indústria fóssil” tendo sido depois agarrado por polícias, alegou que a tinta que utilizou era à base de água, “lavável e ecológica”.

O jovem mencionou ainda em julgamento que estava a vestir o mesmo casaco e calçado que usou na acção, tendo-lhe sido fácil retirar a tinta verde que também lhe manchou o vestuário, após ser detido.

“As próximas vítimas poderemos ser nós”

Citado em comunicado, Vicente Fernandes insiste que é preciso “travar o sistema fóssil que coloca o lucro à frente da vida”.

“A destruição que estamos a ver em Valência com estas cheias de uma dimensão nunca antes vista apenas confirma aquilo que estamos a dizer”, acrescenta o estudante.

“A menos que cortemos drasticamente as emissões de gases de efeito estufa, as próximas vítimas poderemos ser nós ou alguém que amamos e desastres como este só irão piorar enquanto os governos nada fizerem para pôr um fim aos combustíveis fósseis.”

Carta pelo Fim ao Fóssil

Na sequência da audiência, o movimento GCE lançou uma Carta de Estudantes pelo Fim ao Fóssil até 2030, que “está a ser assinada nas escolas de norte a sul do país”, relata Matilde Ventura, porta-voz do movimento que é também testemunha neste caso.

“Exigimos que o nosso governo apresente um plano para acabar com a queima e uso de combustíveis fósseis no nosso país até 2030, através de uma transição justa”, afirma a estudante, citada em comunicado.

Os estudantes garantem que, se o governo não atender a esta reivindicação, “vão iniciar um período de paralisação das escolas” em Abril do próximo ano.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",estudante atirar tinta montenegro pagar fato euro multa decretar tribunal activista climático suceder se haver alto mesa estudante atirar tinta verde Luís montenegro durante campanha eleitoral pagar euro indemnização actual primeiro-ministro fato hugo Boss ficar danificado indemnização pessoa dano causar fevereiro estudante ano colectivo Greve climático estudantil gce atirar tinta verde candidato coligação aliança democrático exigir plano fóssil acordo comunicado gce vicente Fernandes ouvir quarta-feira campus justiça audiência ser ouvir testemunha greve climático estudantil convocar vigília porta campus justiça solidariedade estudante tinta lavável ecológica audiência outubro Luís montenegro pedir indemnização euro dano causar fato isabel Santiago fotógrafa candidato pedir euro indemnização agente polícia pedir indemnização dano roupa alegar conseguir retirar mancha tinta apesar lavagem noticiar agência luso vicente Fernandes atirar tinta actual primeiro-ministro gritar montenegro defender indústria fóssil ter ser agarrar polícia alegar tinta utilizar base água lavável ecológico jovem mencionar julgamento vestir casaco calçar usar acção ter ele ser fácil retirar tinta verde manchar vestuário deter próximo vítima poder citar comunicar vicente Fernandes insistir preciso travar fóssil colocar lucro frente vida destruição estar valência cheia dimensão ver confirmar estar acrescentar estudante cortemos drasticamente emissão gases efeito estufa próximo vítima poder alguém amamos desastr ir piorar governo fizer pôr combustível fóssil carta fóssil sequência audiência movimento Gce lançar carta estudante fóssil assinar escola norte Sul país relatar matilde venturo porta-voz movimento testemunhar caso exigir governo apresente plano acabar queima uso combustível fóssil país transição justo afirmar estudante citar comunicar estudante garantir governo atender reivindicação período paralisação escola abril ano

Nestes últimos tempos temos sido alarmados com os efeitos do aquecimento global e da mudança climática, que ameaçariam o nosso futuro confortável e a que temos direito.

Tudo isto é obra de cientistas de todas as nações, os quais, num conluio irresponsável, nos alarmam, sabe-se lá porquê, sobre o que está e virá a acontecer ao nosso planeta.

Francamente! Lá porque a concentração de CO2 e do metano na atmosfera aumentou para o dobro, querem convencer-nos que o nosso querido clima está a aquecer e a modificar o regime dos ventos, originando tufões e chuvas diluvianas. Que disparate! Tufões sempre existiram (talvez não tão fortes…) e as chuvas torrenciais são normais (ultimamente não tanto…) por esse mundo fora. Qual é então o problema? Por amor à economia mundial aguentem! Não sejam piegas…

Os gelos dos polos estão a derreter, causando a subida do nível do mar? Que disparate! Quem é que não reparou quando o copo do nosso gin tónico vem cheio com gelo até acima, o liquido não transborda quando ele se derrete. Então?!

E quando esses ecologistas tontos que há anos nos alarmam, por exemplo, com a destruição das florestas tropicais? Ora é muito mais útil e dá mais dinheiro que os terrenos desflorestados sejam plantados com soja, que vai alimentar o gado,( que produz metano que, por coincidência, tem forte efeito de estufa), que dará a carne para os hamburgers do país de Trump, o grande líder dos EUA. Quem pode duvidar?

As águas oceânicas estão a aquecer por causa do efeito de estufa? Ora, ora, só vejo benefícios em ter água mais quente, para que os banhos de mar sejam mais agradáveis, para nós e para os nossos queridos turistas.

Esses cientistas dizem que o desaparecimento de inúmeras espécies está a causar uma extinção global semelhante às do passado geológico. Tretas, caros cientistas, então para que servem os jardins zoológicos? E porquê essa preocupação em salvar uns tantos bichos e plantas que não servem à nossa economia e que qualquer cidadão normal nunca viu, a não ser, talvez, na televisão?

Isto são apenas alguns exemplos que provam que o aquecimento global é uma grande patranha e que a nossa vidinha vai continuar como sempre. Era o que faltava que assim não fosse!

Não esqueçamos que o presidente Trump afirmou que o aquecimento global era uma conspiração dos chineses para prejudicar a economia dos EUA. Quem se atreve a duvidar do chefe do país mais desenvolvido e poderoso do mundo?

Deixei para o fim o meu principal argumento. Alguém acredita que os governos da grande maioria dos países do mundo, ao continuarem a comportar-se como têm feito até hoje, produzindo e usando mais viaturas, gastando mais e mais hidrocarbonetos, explorando mais campos petrolíferos, poluindo rios e oceanos, consumindo cada vez mais recursos desejando nos seus programas políticos sempre maior crescimento económico, sem olhar a meios, estarão errados? Esqueceremos nós que esses governos são compostos pelos melhores e mais sabedores cidadãos, livremente escolhidos pelo povo? Sendo assim, não temos o direito de duvidar das suas decisões que serão, certamente, as melhores para o futuro da Humanidade.

Em entrevista ao jornal Washington Post, presidente ucraniano reconheceu a escassez de armamento enfrentada pelas forças ucranianas e disse que, sem ajuda dos EUA, as tropas terão de bater em retirada.

As Forças Armadas da Ucrânia recuarão constantemente se os Estados Unidos não prestarem a assistência necessária. Foi o que declarou esta sexta-feira (29) o presidente ucraniano, Vladimir Zelensky, em entrevista ao jornal Washington Post.

""Se não houver apoio dos Estados Unidos, isso significa que não teremos defesa aérea, nem mísseis Patriot, nem equipamento de interferência eletrónica, nem projéteis de artilharia de 155 milímetros. Isto significa que recuaremos, passo a passo, pequenos passos [no campo de batalha]"", disse Zelensky.

Acrescentou que a Ucrânia enfrenta problemas na defesa aérea, e disse que sem apoio do Congresso dos EUA haverá escassez de mísseis.

""Sem o apoio do Congresso [dos EUA], teremos uma grande escassez de mísseis. Isso é um problema. Estamos a construir os nossos próprios sistemas de defesa aérea, mas isso não é suficiente"".

Segundo disse, as Forças Armadas ucranianas estão a tentar encontrar uma forma de não recuar na zona de combate.

""Se a situação na frente de combate se mantiver estável, então na retaguarda a Ucrânia será capaz de armar e treinar novas brigadas para lançar uma nova tentativa de contraofensiva este ano"", disse o presidente ucraniano.

No verão passado, as tropas ucranianas lançaram uma tentativa de contraofensiva que se revelou um fracasso. No período, quase 166 mil soldados ucranianos foram mortos, 800 tanques destruídos, incluindo metade dos tanques Leopard alemães, além de 123 aeronaves e 2,4 mil veículos blindados.

Antes, o canal Fox News, citando uma carta da responsável do Gabinete de Gestão e Orçamento da Casa Branca, Shalanda Young, ao senador J.D. Vance, noticiou que o Governo norte-americano gastou pelo menos 113 mil milhões de dólares (cerca de 667 reais mil milhões) em auxílio da Ucrânia.

No entanto, como disse o diretor da CIA, Robert Burns, em meados de Março, sem assistência militar adicional de Washington, as autoridades de Kiev terão de acordar conversações de paz nos termos da Rússia no prazo de um ano. Salientou que a falta de apoio americano resultará numa maior retirada e perda de território para as Forças Armadas Ucranianas.

Embora Kiev rejeite publicamente as acusações de ser ""hospitaleiro"" ao terrorismo internacional, até os jornalistas ucranianos admitem que as autoridades do país fecham ""estranhamente"" os olhos à questão.

O membro do alto escalão do Daesh (organização terrorista proibida na Rússia e em vários outros países), Caesar Tokhosashvili, também conhecido por al-Bara al-Shishani, viveu ""discretamente"" com a mulher e os três filhos na cidade ucraniana de Belaya Tserkov durante mais de um ano antes de ser rastreado e detido pela Agência Central de Inteligência (CIA) em 2019, revelaram os relatórios.

A notícia mina a posição oficial da Ucrânia de oposição ao terrorismo e indica que o país continua a ser um porto seguro para estes agentes.

A operação da CIA para capturar Tokhosashvili — que é de origem georgiana — foi conduzida em colaboração com o Ministério do Interior da Geórgia e o Serviço de Segurança da Ucrânia (SBU, na sigla em ucraniano). Até os media ocidentais se perguntaram na altura: ""Por que razão escolheram não o prender antes?""

O que se sabe sobre o notório terrorista do Daesh?

A sua detenção há cinco anos fez manchetes globais, com o The Independent a citar Philip Ingram, um antigo oficial dos serviços de informação britânicos, a admitir que o governo ""frouxo"" de Kiev tinha criado ""uma vulnerabilidade óbvia ao terrorismo internacional"", algo que, segundo ele, ""Kiev não parece totalmente interessada em abordar"".

O ex-oficial foi ecoado por Vera Mironova, especialista em jihad e investigadora visitante da Universidade de Harvard, que disse ao The Independent que ""centenas"" de ex-militantes do Daesh tinham ""fugido para a Ucrânia"".

""Quando estes terroristas chegam à Ucrânia, raramente encontram problemas com as autoridades"", segundo Mironova.

Um tom semelhante foi adotado pela jornalista Katerina Sergatskova, radicada em Kiev, que sublinhou que as autoridades ucranianas continuam ""estranhamente descontraídas em relação ao assunto"".

""Sempre que escrevi sobre o assunto, os funcionários do governo acusaram-me de inventar o problema. Mas a detenção de um dos principais comandantes do Daesh aqui em Kiev, mesmo debaixo dos nossos narizes, sugeriria certamente que muitos dos homens mais perigosos do mundo pensam na Ucrânia como uma casa segura.

O SBU rejeitou repetidamente as alegações de que Kiev ""era de alguma forma hospitaleira para o terrorismo internacional"". Mironova alertou que as autoridades ucranianas teriam ""um grande problema em mãos"" se mais membros do Daesh sediados na Ucrânia ""ficassem aterrorizados com a possibilidade de serem presos"".

Já 1609 cientistas, incluindo vários prémios Nobel, assinaram uma declaração intitulada “Não Há Emergência Climática”. Este texto foi promovido pela Climate Intelligence Foundation (CLINTEL). “A ciência climática deve ser menos política, enquanto a política climática deve ser mais científica”, refere o texto.

“Não há nenhuma emergência climática. Portanto, não há motivo para pânico e alarme. Opomo-nos fortemente à política prejudicial e irrealista de Net Zero de CO2 proposta para 2050. Apostar na adaptação no lugar da mitigação; a adaptação funciona independentemente das causas”, disse o grupo de cientistas.

Defendem que este gás é “essencial” para o nosso planeta. Defendem, ainda, que “o clima da Terra tem variado desde que o planeta existe, e o planeta passou por várias fases frias e quentes”.

Dois “vencedores do Prémio Nobel”

Os físicos norte-americanos Ivar Giaever e John F. Clauser, Prémios Nobel em 1973 e 2022, respetivamente, juntaram-se à declaração contra a crise das alterações climáticas.

Disseram que “a narrativa popular sobre as alterações climáticas reflete uma perigosa corrupção da ciência que ameaça a economia global e o bem-estar de milhares de milhões de pessoas”.

Um espanhol entre os signatários

O maiorquino Luis Pomar, geólogo e professor emérito da Universidade das Ilhas Baleares, está na lista dos cientistas que rejeitam as alterações climáticas. O espanhol foi o primeiro a conquistar a medalha Sorby da Associação Internacional de Sedimentologia.

Pontos da declaração

O texto intitulado “Não há emergência climática” inclui os seguintes pontos:

– O registo geológico revela que o clima da Terra tem variado desde que o planeta existe, com fases frias e quentes naturais. A Pequena Era Glaciar terminou em 1850. Por isso, não é de estranhar que estejamos agora a passar por um período de aquecimento.

– O mundo aqueceu significativamente menos do que o previsto pelo IPCC com base no efeito antropogénico modelado. O fosso entre o mundo real e o mundo modelado diz-nos que estamos longe de compreender as alterações climáticas.

– Os modelos climáticos têm muitas falhas e não são minimamente plausíveis como ferramentas de política global. Exageram o efeito dos gases com efeito de estufa, como o CO2. Além disso, ignoram o facto de que o enriquecimento da atmosfera com CO2 é benéfico.

– O CO2 não é um poluente. Ele é essencial para a vida na Terra. A fotossíntese é uma bênção. Mais CO2 é benéfico para a natureza, torna a Terra mais verde: o CO2 extra no ar promoveu o crescimento da biomassa vegetal do mundo. Também é bom para a agricultura, pois aumenta a produtividade das culturas em todo o mundo.

– Não há provas estatísticas de que o aquecimento global esteja a intensificar os furacões, as inundações, as secas e catástrofes naturais semelhantes, ou a torná-los mais frequentes. No entanto, existem amplas evidências de que as medidas de mitigação de CO2 são prejudiciais e dispendiosas.

Não há emergência climática. Portanto, não há motivo para pânico e alarme. Opomo-nos veementemente à política prejudicial e irrealista de emissões Net Zero de CO2 proposta para 2050. Se surgirem melhores abordagens, e sem dúvida que surgirão, teremos muito tempo para refletir e readaptar-nos. O objetivo da política global deve ser a “prosperidade para todos” através do fornecimento de energia fiável e acessível em todos os momentos. Numa sociedade próspera, homens e mulheres são bem-educados, as taxas de natalidade são baixas e as pessoas preocupam-se com o ambiente.

O movimento Climáximo criticou a proposta de Governo para o Orçamento do Estado para 2025, entregue hoje, que diz garantir “o colapso climático”, lamentando a falta de investimento na transição energética.

“Não apresenta nenhum investimento em empregos para o clima ou numa transição energética justa para sairmos da economia fóssil”, lamenta o coletivo em comunicado.

Na proposta hoje entregue à Assembleia da República, o Governo diz que vai rever o Roteiro para a Neutralidade Carbónica e mantém o objetivo de atingir a neutralidade carbónica até 2045.

Além do incremento das energias renováveis, de incentivos para a produção dos gases renováveis e do armazenamento de energia, e de medidas nas matérias-primas críticas, em 2025 haverá novas medidas e apoios para reforçar a eficiência energética e combater a pobreza energética.

As medidas são, no entanto, insuficientes no entender do Climáximo, que acusa o executivo de não estar “do lado das pessoas”, considerando que o diploma vai “garantir o colapso climático, a pobreza e a injustiça social”.

O OE2025, continua o coletivo, “garante a manutenção e proliferação de infraestruturas fósseis, como a expansão do aeroporto e as centrais de gás, autênticas bombas de carbono”.

Em referência às recentes negociações entre o Governo e o PS, os ativistas lamentam ainda que o clima não tenha estado nas prioridades.

“Vemos governos e partidos que preferem fazer birras em torno dos pontos percentuais do IRC, em vez de se preocuparem em colocarem como prioritária a resolução da maior crise alguma vez enfrentada pela humanidade e garantirem uma vida digna e justa para toda a população”, escreve o coletivo em comunicado.

O Governo entregou ontem no parlamento a proposta de Orçamento do Estado para 2025 (OE2025), que prevê que a economia cresça 1,8% em 2024 e 2,1% em 2025.

Segundo o documento, o Governo prevê um excedente de 0,4% este ano e de 0,3% no próximo.

A proposta ainda não tem assegurada a sua viabilização na generalidade e a votação está marcada para o próximo dia 31.

Se a proposta de Orçamento do Governo PSD/CDS for viabilizada na generalidade com a abstenção do PS ou, em alternativa, com os votos favoráveis do Chega, será então apreciada na especialidade no parlamento entre 22 e 29 de novembro.

O presidente lituano, Gitanas Nauseda, apelou na quarta-feira (13) aos aliados da Ucrânia para pararem de ""traçar linhas vermelhas"" em termos do que estão dispostos a fazer para apoiar Kiev.

Enquanto discursava no Fórum de Defesa e Estratégia de Paris, Nauseda fez os seus comentários baseados nas declarações do presidente francês Emmanuel Macron quando este sugeriu o envio de tropas da NATO para a Ucrânia.

Macron recuou um pouco na posição alguns dias depois após a reação dos seus aliados, mas disse de seguida que agora não era altura ""de ser cobarde na Europa"".

O líder da Lituânia disse que saúda o debate aberto pelo líder francês sobre o envio de tropas.

""Congratulei-me com a ideia de enviar missões para o território ucraniano e penso que deveríamos discuti-la. É claro que seria melhor se todos concordássemos unanimemente com a necessidade disso e avaliássemos muito bem a inteligência e outras informações que obtivemos"", disse Nauseda, de acordo com o portal Newsweek.

O presidente lituano sublinhou ainda que o receio de uma possível reação do Kremlin não deve ser um fator determinante na tomada de uma decisão europeia comum.

""Se começarmos a dizer que 'não, [o presidente russo] Vladimir Putin não vai gostar disto ou daquilo [...]' nunca tomaremos uma decisão. E foi por isso que ontem [12] disse ao presidente [Emmanuel Macron] e aos media que temos de parar de traçar linhas vermelhas para nós próprios"", acrescentou.

Salientou que, ao traçar linhas vermelhas, o Ocidente está apenas a ajudar Putin ""que começa a pensar que somos previsíveis e manipuláveis"", complementou.

Não é a primeira vez que Nauseda faz comentários deste género, em janeiro do ano passado, disse que ""devem ser ultrapassadas linhas vermelhas para fornecer caças e mísseis à Ucrânia"", segundo a emissora estatal LRT.

Moscovo já deixou claro que qualquer carregamento que inclua armas destinadas a Kiev se tornará um alvo legítimo para as Forças Armadas russas no campo de batalha. Ao mesmo tempo, o Presidente Vladimir Putin já alertou o Ocidente para as consequências de um envio de tropas para território ucraniano.

PT_294.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears;CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other;CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Amplifying existing fears of global warming,"Casos de transmissão local confirmam que dengue é 'fenómeno duradouro' em França

“Foram identificados até nove focos de transmissão autóctone de dengue, resultando num total de 45 casos de infeções"", detalhou o anúncio da Santé Publique France, a agência de vigilância sanitária francesa, ao divulgar o balanço do ano de 2023. Os números são considerados elevados, mas abaixo do recorde de 2022, observam as autoridades.

A dengue é uma doença viral que provoca febre alta e, em casos raros, progride para uma forma mais grave, provocando hemorragias. Apenas cerca de 0,01% de todos os casos evoluem para a morte do doente.

Um “caso autóctone” significa que a pessoa não viajou recentemente para outras regiões do mundo, como as Antilhas, onde este vírus, transmitido de pessoa para pessoa pelos mosquitos tigre (Aedes albopictus), circula amplamente. Isto significa que a pessoa foi provavelmente infectada na França continental, após ter sido picada por um destes mosquitos, cuja presença tem vindo a aumentar há quase 20 anos. Dos 95 departamentos franceses, o inseto foi observado em mais de 70, e as alterações climáticas favorecem este fenómeno.

Cada vez mais a norte

Segundo as autoridades de saúde, os dados mostram num aumento sem precedentes de casos autóctones de dengue na França continental, que ainda eram excepcionais há alguns anos. Apesar de um pequeno declínio – após cerca de 60 casos em 2022 – o ano passado confirma a tendência para a manutenção do vírus em território francês.

Além disso, pela primeira vez foram registados vários casos na região de Paris, em Limeil-Brévannes (Val-de-Marne), a cerca de 15 km a sudeste da capital. Até então, não eram comuns os registos de casos tão a norte.

Com a proliferação do mosquito Tigre, o primeiro caso de dengue autóctone na região Île de France, onde se situa Paris, ocorreu em agosto do ano passado. Segundo a agência de saúde francesa Santé Publique France, a contaminação, no norte do país, era até então inédita.

A expansão do mosquito Tigre é favorecida pelo aquecimento global: quanto mais quente, mais curto se torna o ciclo de desenvolvimento do mosquito e aumenta a velocidade de multiplicação do vírus no interior do inseto.

Apesar do aumento do calor, as viagens internacionais e o comportamento humano são ainda as causas mais comuns para a proliferação do mosquito da dengue nas regiões de clima temperado.

Para além dos casos autóctones, as autoridades de saúde mantêm também a vigilância dos casos importados para a França continental por pessoas picadas e infectadas fora do território francês, sendo que os casos mais numerosos se observam nas Antilhas ou na Guiana.

“No total, foram identificados 2.019 casos importados de dengue”, referiu a Santé Publique France, atestando um nível recorde para estes casos importados. “Trinca casos de Chikungunya (....) e 9 casos de Zika”, duas outras doenças transmitidas por estes mosquitos, “também foram notificados”, acrescentou a agência.

A imprensa francesa tem informado, recentemente, sobre a ameaça de uma nova epidemia de dengue no Brasil. A explosão do número de contaminações e as dificuldades dos hospitais para satisfazer a procura foi tema de reportagem do Le Monde, em fevereiro. Desde o início do ano, o Ministério da Saúde registou mais de 512 mil casos da doença no Brasil.

""Trata-se de uma questão difícil. Do ponto de vista jurídico é um problema, mas do ponto de vista prático, estamos abertos a alcançar os nossos objetivos através de negociações. Portanto, são possíveis várias variantes"", declarou o porta-voz presidencial.

A legitimidade de Zelensky à frente da Presidência da Ucrânia tem sido uma questão levantada pela Rússia, que argumenta que o mandato do governante ucraniano terminou no passado dia 20 de maio.

O porta-voz russo afirmou que além dos ""problemas de legitimidade de Zelensky"", existe também ""o problema da proibição de estabelecer qualquer contacto ou negociação com o lado russo, pois essa proibição permanece em vigor"".

""Portanto, ainda há muito para esclarecer e precisamos de ouvir algumas explicações"", afirmou Peskov.

Na sequência das recentes declarações de Zelensky sobre a sua disponibilidade para negociar uma solução pacífica para a guerra na Ucrânia, o porta-voz da presidência russa sublinhou que ""a Rússia está geralmente aberta ao processo de negociações, mas é necessário perceber até que ponto o lado ucraniano está preparado"".

""Para já, como podem ver, ouvimos declarações muito diferentes, até agora as coisas não estão muito claras"", acrescentou.

Na quarta-feira, Peskov recordou que o Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, tinha afirmado que ""Zelensky perdeu a legitimidade"" após o fim do seu mandato, o que ""é um fator que pode dificultar consideravelmente o processo de paz"".

O porta-voz sublinhou ainda que a Rússia irá garantir a defesa dos seus interesses e a segurança em qualquer caso, seja através das negociações ou das armas.

""A operação militar especial foi iniciada como um recurso extremo para atingir os nossos objetivos"", disse Peskov, frisando que ""qualquer guerra termina com negociações de paz"".

Nos últimos dias, Zelensky reforçou a necessidade de negociações para colocar fim à guerra o mais rápido possível.

O Presidente ucraniano manteve recentemente contactos com representantes políticos favoráveis a um cessar-fogo imediato, como o primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, o candidato republicano à Presidência dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, ou o secretário de Estado do Vaticano, Pietro Parolin.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Ucrânia, Dmytro Kuleba, deslocou-se esta semana à China para abordar potenciais conversações de paz entre a Ucrânia e a Rússia.

A Ucrânia tem contado com ajuda financeira e em armamento dos aliados ocidentais desde que a Rússia invadiu o país, em 24 de fevereiro de 2022.

Os aliados de Kiev também têm decretado sanções contra setores-chave da economia russa para tentar diminuir a capacidade de Moscovo de financiar o esforço de guerra na Ucrânia.",PT,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other']",Rússia disponível negociar zelensky questionar legitimidade tratar se difícil vista jurídico problema vista prático estar aberto alcançar objetivo negociação possível várias variante declarar porta-voz presidencial legitimidade zelensky frente presidência ucrânia ser levantar Rússia argumentar mandato governante ucraniano terminar passado dia maio porta-voz russo afirmar problema legitimidade zelensky existir problema proibição estabelecer contacto negociação russo proibição permanecer vigor haver esclarecer precisamo ouvir explicação afirmar peskov sequência recente declaração zelensky disponibilidade negociar solução pacífico guerra ucrânia porta-voz presidência russo sublinhar Rússia geralmente abrir processo negociação necessário perceber ucraniano preparar ouvir declaração diferente coisa claro acrescentar quarta-feira Peskov recordar presidente russo vladimir putin ter afirmar zelensky perder legitimidade mandato fator dificultar consideravelmente processo paz porta-voz sublinhar Rússia garantir defesa interesse segurança caso ser negociação arma operação militar especial iniciar recurso extremo atingir objetivo dizer Peskov frisar guerra terminar negociação paz último dia zelensky reforçar necessidade negociação colocar guerra rápido presidente ucraniano manter recentemente contacto representante político favorável cessar-fogo imediato primeiro-ministro húngaro viktor orbán candidato republicano presidência Estados Unidos donald Trump secretário vaticano pietro parolin ministro negócio estrangeiro ucrânia dmytro Kuleba deslocar se semana china abordar potencial conversação paz ucrânia Rússia ucrânia contar ajuda financeiro armamento aliado ocidental Rússia invadir país fevereiro aliado kiev decretar sanção setores-chave economia russo diminuir capacidade Moscovo financiar esforço guerra ucrânia

De acordo com as primeiras informações, mais de 50 pessoas morreram nas cheias, embora o número possa aumentar, uma vez que as operações de busca estão em curso"", disse à EFE o porta-voz do departamento provincial de informação e cultura, Assadullah Mustafa Hashimi.

A mesma fonte acrescentou que as autoridades enviaram equipas civis e militares para ajudar nos esforços de socorro.

Nos últimos meses, o Afeganistão registou fortes nevões, chuvas torrenciais e inundações repentinas, que provocaram a morte a mais de 130 pessoas e a destruição de milhares de casas, segundo dados oficiais, além das cerca de 50 de hoje em Baghlan.

O país asiático é um dos mais vulneráveis do mundo às alterações climáticas e o menos preparado para se adaptar, de acordo com um relatório do Gabinete de Coordenação dos Assuntos Humanitários das Nações Unidas (OCHA).

Para o Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros, a Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) e os Estados Unidos estão focados numa escalada da crise na Ucrânia, o que gera riscos estratégicos e pode ainda levar a um confronto entre potências nucleares.

""Os Estados Unidos e a NATO não manifestam o mínimo interesse numa resolução justa do atual conflito. Claramente não estão dispostos a considerar as preocupações russas e a trabalhar seriamente na eliminação das contradições fundamentais"", referiu um comunicado da pasta.

A operação militar especial vai completar dois anos em fevereiro, no meio das constantes derrotas ucranianas e da insistência do regime de Vladimir Zelensky em continuar os combates a qualquer custo para o país.

""O Ocidente está focado na escalada da crise ucraniana, o que representa agora os principais riscos estratégicos, pois tal rumo pode levar a um confronto direto entre potências nucleares com consequências catastróficas"", acrescentou o ministério.

Moscovo acrescentou ainda que ""a política destrutiva dos EUA levou a uma profunda degradação das relações russo-americanas e a uma mudança radical das circunstâncias na área da segurança"".

Além disso, a Rússia indicou repetidamente estar disposta a negociar, enquanto Kiev se recusa a dialogar. Anteriormente, Moscovo afirmou que não havia precondições para que a situação na Ucrânia se movesse para uma solução pacífica, e que o objetivo prioritário era cumprir as metas da operação especial, que neste momento só são possíveis militarmente.

Mais de 600 mil pessoas estão na zona de combate

Mais de 600 mil militares russos estão na zona de combate, disse esta sexta-feira Vladimir Putin, presidente da Rússia.

""Quanto à decisão de lançar a operação militar especial, […] não houve outras considerações além de uma — a defesa dos interesses da Rússia. Nenhuma mesmo. E não pode haver e não houve outros motivos ao abordar questões deste tipo"", disse Putin.

Deu nota que a Rússia tentou previamente e de todas as formas possíveis construir relações com a Ucrânia.

O Kremlin afirmou esta quarta-feira, 24, que a posição da Ucrânia nas negociações para o fim da guerra parecem estar em sintonia com a Rússia.

Durante uma visita à China para participar nas negociações sobre o fim da guerra contra a Rússia, o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Ucrânia, Dmytro Kuleba, “disse novamente que está pronto para envolver o lado russo num processo de negociação em alguma fase, quando a Rússia estiver pronta para negociar de boa-fé”, afirmou o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros chinês, Wang Yi.

No entanto, Kuleba ""enfatizou que não vê tal prontidão do lado russo agora”, acrescentou Wang.

Em resposta aos comentários do ministro ucraniano, o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, disse que “a mensagem em si pode ser vista em uníssiono com a nossa posição.”

“Sabem que o lado russo nunca se recusou a negociar, sempre manteve a sua abertura ao processo de negociação, mas os detalhes são importantes aqui e tanto vocês como eu ainda não sabemos”, disse.

É a primeira vez que os governos de Moscovo e Kiev falam aberta e simultaneamente sobre uma possível retoma dos diálogos pela paz desde que as negociações falharam em chegar a um acordo entre as duas partes em 2022.

Negociações de cessar-fogo

À medida que os combates se prolongam, o presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, convidou, na semana passada, a Rússia a participar na segunda cimeira da paz organizada pela Ucrânia para discutir sobre o fim da guerra. Na última reunião, realizada em junho na Suíça, 92 nações participaram no encontro que não contou com a presença de Moscovo.

Putin está pronto para interromper a guerra na Ucrânia através de um cessar-fogo negociado, disseram fontes russas à agência noticiosa Reuters em maio.

No entanto, o presidente russo afirmou, no mês passado, que o conflito só chegaria ao fim se Kiev aceitasse abandonar os seus planos de entrar na NATO e entregar a totalidade das quatro províncias ucranianas reivindicadas por Moscovo. A Ucrânia, por sua vez, rejeitou as exigências que considera equivalentes a uma rendição.

A China apresenta-se como um partido neutro na guerra, apesar de manter relações próximas com Moscovo e de nunca ter condenado a invasão russa à Ucrânia.

O fim do confronto entre Moscovo e Kiev deverá ser acompanhado pela eliminação da ameaça que o Ocidente representa para a segurança da Rússia, afirmou o chefe dos Negócios Estrangeiros durante um debate aberto do Conselho de Segurança convocado pela sua delegação, que este mês preside àquela entidade .

Lavrov insistiu que tanto o seu país como o Ocidente precisam de garantias e acordos mútuos, numa clara alusão à necessidade de chegar a acordo para a segurança de ambos.

Ao mesmo tempo, considerou necessário ter em conta as novas realidades geoestratégicas no continente euro-asiático, onde se está a formar uma nova arquitectura de segurança continental verdadeiramente igual e indivisível.

Neste contexto, acrescentou, a Europa corre o risco de ficar para trás neste processo objectivamente histórico.

“Estamos prontos para procurar um equilíbrio de interesses”, disse ainda.

O equilíbrio de poder global e regional também deve ser restaurado, juntamente com a reparação das injustiças na economia global, acrescentou o diplomata sénior.

O Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo rejeitou a utilização destas medidas coercivas num mundo multipolar que, na sua opinião, não deveria ter qualquer monopólio na regulação financeira ou monetária, no comércio ou nas tecnologias.

Relativamente à política norte-americana, o chefe da diplomacia russa alertou que Washington está convencido de que uma nova guerra global não afetará os Estados Unidos, mas sim os seus aliados europeus.

“Se esta análise constitui a base da estratégia da administração (Joe) Biden, é um erro muito perigoso, e os europeus deveriam perceber que lhes foi atribuído um papel suicida”, acrescentou perante os membros do órgão máximo para a paz do planeta.

Ao mesmo tempo, exigiu mais atenção às minorias nacionais para resolver o conflito em território ucraniano.

“Pedimos a todos aqueles que demonstram um interesse sincero em superar a crise na Ucrânia que considerem em qualquer uma das suas propostas a questão fundamental dos direitos das minorias nacionais. Todos, sem exceção”, insistiu o alto representante.

Comentador afirma que, a partir do momento em que existir um convite formal à Ucrânia para aderir à NATO, a postura do Kremlin vai mudar

Vai contra os princípios da NATO e o presidente da Ucrânia sabe disso, mas mesmo assim não abdicou de colocar como prioridade a adesão imediata do país à Aliança Atlântica.

É esse o ponto número um do Plano de Vitória apresentado por Volodymyr Zelensky, que falou pela primeira vez na possibilidade de a Ucrânia ter armas nucleares, revelando mesmo uma conversa que teve com Donald Trump.

Para Miguel Sousa Tavares esta era uma questão de tempo. “Tinha dito que ia chegar o momento em que Zelensky falaria de armas nucleares e hoje falou”, referiu o comentador da TVI (do mesmo grupo da CNN Portugal), na sua rubrica 5.ª Coluna, do Jornal Nacional.

“Esta pretensão de entrar na NATO foi o que desencadeou a guerra, foi o pretexto que Putin usou para invadir a Ucrânia”, lembra Miguel Sousa Tavares, sublinhando que essa mesma invasão, apesar de ilegítima, “não é infundamentada”, já que o presidente russo não quer mais um país nas suas fronteiras a pertencer ao principal inimigo militar da Rússia.

O comentador da TVI assinala que “Zelensky sabe bem que os estatutos da NATO proíbem que um país em guerra entre no Tratado do Atlântico Norte”. É a tal proteção do artigo 5.º, que colocaria toda a NATO em guerra caso a Ucrânia entrasse agora na organização.

“Os pais fundadores previram isto. Se, como pretende Zelensky, a Ucrânia entrasse na NATO, nós todos, Portugal incluído, estávamos em guerra contra a Rússia”, lembrou.

E o problema, acrescentou Miguel Sousa Tavares, é que os russos “são muito ligados ao formalismo das coisas”. O mesmo é dizer que no Kremlin se olhará para um convite à adesão como uma adesão em si.

“Convém nunca subestimar a maneira como dos Urais para lá se pensa nas questões políticas, que não é igual à nossa. A partir do convite formal, Putin vai considerar que a Ucrânia faz parte da NATO”, terminou.",PT,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: Other', 'URW: Blaming the war on others rather than the invader: Ukraine is the aggressor', 'URW: Amplifying war-related fears: NATO should/will directly intervene', 'URW: Negative Consequences for the West: Other']",ter dizer ir chegar zelensky falaria arma nuclear sousar tavar pedir subestime Rússia putin comentador afirmar existir convite formal ucrânia aderir nato postura kremlin mudar princípio nato presidente ucrânia abdicar colocar prioridade adesão imediato país aliança atlântico plano vitória apresentar volodymyr zelensky falar possibilidade ucrânia arma nuclear revelar conversa donald Trump Miguel sousar tavar ter dizer ir chegar zelensky falaria arma nuclear hoje falar referir comentador tvi cnn Portugal rubrica coluna jornal nacional pretensão entrar nato desencadear guerra pretexto putinr usar invadir ucrânia lembrar Miguel Sousa tavar sublinhar mesmo invasão apesar ilegítimo infundamentar presidente russo país fronteira pertencer principal inimigo militar Rússia comentador tvi assinalar zelensky estatuto nato proíber país guerra tratado atlântico norte proteção artigo colocar nato guerra caso ucrânia entrar organização pai fundador previr pretender zelensky ucrânia entrar nato Portugal incluir estar guerra Rússia lembrar problema acrescentar Miguel Sousa tavar russo ligar formalismo coisa kremlin olhar convite adesão adesão se convém subestimar maneira ural pensar questão político igual convite formal putin considerar ucrânia nato terminar

A mudança climática parece preocupar pouco os participantes na convenção republicana em Milwaukee, reunida para aprovar Donald Trump como candidato às eleições americanas de novembro.

""Não acredito em nada disso"", afirma Jack Prendergast, delegado de Nova York na reunião, convencido de que as ""erupções vulcânicas"" causam tanto dano ao planeta como ""as ações do homem"". Ele espera impaciente o retorno de Donald Trump à Casa Branca para que os Estados Unidos ""se tornem o primeiro produtor de petróleo e gás do mundo"".

Ceticismo

O ex-presidente, que concorre para tirar Joe Biden da Casa Branca, tem o lema de ""drill, baby, drill"", que resume o seu apoio à exploração e uso de combustível fósseis.

Trump, que regularmente faz comentários céticos sobre o clima, denunciou o Acordo de Paris durante seu primeiro governo.

Esta semana, os republicanos aprovaram a sua candidatura para um segundo mandato. Para ser seu companheiro nas eleições, Trump escolheu o senador J.D. Vance, também cético sobre o clima.

O senador originário de Ohio, que se tornará vice-presidente se Trump for eleito, acusou no passado os democratas de despertarem os temores sobre a ""crise ambiental"" com fins eleitorais.

O programa que os dois defenderão nas eleições foi adotado na segunda pelos delegados republicanos em Milwaukee. O documento de 5 mil palavras não faz a menor menção ao clima nem às energias renováveis, apesar de o país sofrer uma onda de calor.

Pelo contrário, o texto pede o fim das medidas ""verdes"", qualificadas de ""socialistas"". O próprio Trump opõe-se à energia eólica, convencido de que as turbinas ""matam os pássaros"".

Trabalho de longo prazo

Ambientalistas como o Sunrise Movement criticaram a plataforma republicana, dizendo que o partido “deixou claro que está feliz em piorar a crise climática”.

“Temos que ver as palavras deles com um pouco de perspectiva”, sorri Stephen Perkins, da American Conservation Coalition, talvez o único stand na convenção de Milwaukee a discutir a preservação do planeta.

“Acho que alguns dos seus comentários têm mais a intenção de entreter do que de expressar posições políticas”, disse à AFP o jovem de 29 anos.

A sua organização está presente nesse grande centro desportivo de Milwaukee para defender uma “abordagem conservadora da política climática”, que poderia permitir aos republicanos “conquistar” o voto dos jovens, acredita ele. “É uma tarefa de longo prazo”, admite Perkins, referindo-se a uma ‘aversão natural’ à questão, especialmente entre os republicanos mais velhos.

Seita radical

De acordo com uma pesquisa de Yale divulgada na terça-feira, 16, mais de dois terços dos americanos acreditam na existência da mudança climática.

No entanto, isso não se traduz necessariamente em apoio ao presidente democrata Joe Biden, que promoveu várias iniciativas para combater o aquecimento global durante seu mandato.

Perkins, por outro lado, acredita que Biden está à mercê de uma “seita radical” de progressistas “que não se prendem a nuances”.

Processo iniciado pela Ucrânia em janeiro de 2017 fazia várias acusações contra a Rússia, responsabilizando-a pelos ataques em Donetsk e pela queda do avião Boeing MH17. Esta quarta-feira (31), o Tribunal Internacional de Justiça (TIJ) não considerou o país culpado.

Após o veredicto do tribunal internacional ligado à Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU), a senadora russa de Sevastopol Ekaterina Altabayeva afirmou à Sputnik que a decisão é apenas o primeiro passo em direção à verdade sobre a situação na Ucrânia.

Numa decisão histórica, o tribunal não cedeu às exigências de Kiev, que pedia fundamentalmente que a Rússia fosse reconhecida como ""Estado agressor"" e as repúblicas populares de Donetsk e Lugansk (RPD e RPL) como ""organizações terroristas"".

Foram também rejeitadas a maioria das reivindicações da Ucrânia contra a Rússia na Crimeia ao abrigo da Convenção Internacional sobre a Eliminação de Todas as Formas de Discriminação Racial, anunciou a presidente do TIJ, Joan Donoghue.

""Em particular, isto indica que chegará o momento em que o governo ucraniano será avaliado. Este é o primeiro passo, e a avaliação do regime ucraniano e a investigação dos crimes de certos políticos, membros de organizações terroristas, como o 'Azov' na Ucrânia, ocorrerão; tenho a certeza de que isso acontecerá num futuro previsível.

Além disso, a senadora realçou que as decisões do tribunal ""colocaram a Ucrânia no seu devido lugar"".

""Acredito que este é um sinal importante para a comunidade internacional; ele diz que é necessário avaliar objetivamente o que está a acontecer na Ucrânia"", acrescentou.

As acusações de Kiev

O processo, iniciado por Kiev em janeiro de 2017, abordou várias questões, sendo uma delas a responsabilidade da Rússia pela queda de um avião Boeing MH17. No entanto o tribunal rejeitou esta exigência, não considerando a Rússia culpada pelo incidente.

Além disso, o tribunal não sustentou os argumentos da Ucrânia sobre o alegado envolvimento da Rússia e a responsabilidade das milícias de Donetsk em vários ataques, incluindo os bombardeamentos do posto de controlo militar de Bugas, perto de Volnovakha; do campo de aviação militar em Kramatorsk; e das posições das Forças Armadas ucranianas em Mariupol e Avdeevka, ocorridos no período de 2014 a 2017.

No que diz respeito às acusações de financiamento do terrorismo, o tribunal indicou que a Rússia cumpriu as suas obrigações de cooperação, incluindo a identificação e o bloqueio de fundos utilizados para financiar o terrorismo.

Tido como um dos obstáculos ao combate à fome, os prejuízos para a economia global em consequência da adulteração de alimentos atingem anualmente 49 mil milhões de dólares. Numa participação no II Fórum Esfera Internacional, o jurista Pierpaolo Bottini defendeu que, para além de se pensar em soluções focadas na segurança pública, os atores governamentais e o setor privado se articulem pelo reforço das políticas de segurança alimentar.

“Quando falamos em segurança alimentar, não estamos a falar só de fazer chegar o alimento às pessoas, mas sim de fazer chegar um alimento de qualidade. Depois temos a adulteração do alimento, o contrabando de alimentos, a extorsão do agricultor na ponta, a manipulação do preço, o cartel. Tudo isto afeta qualquer política institucional de segurança pública”, afirmou durante um painel que contou com a participação da cofundadora do Pacto Contra a Fome, Geyze Diniz, e da embaixadora Carla Barroso, representante do Brasil nas agências da Organização das Nações Unidas sediadas em Roma.

O crime organizado drena o dinheiro que poderia ser utilizado para fomentar o crédito agrícola, por exemplo. Ao citar um estudo realizado pela Esfera Brasil em parceria com o Fórum Brasileiro de Segurança Pública, Bottini lembrou que o custo das organizações criminosas para o Brasil está atualmente estimado em 4,9% do Produto Interno Bruto (PIB), e os gastos dos entes federativos e União com a segurança pública atingem a casa dos 130 mil milhões de dólares.

“Assim como todas as outras atividades humanas, toda a política pública, inclusive de segurança alimentar, é afetada pelo crime organizado de maneira direta e de maneira indireta”, afirmou.

Insegurança alimentar afeta 700 milhões de pessoas

Nos últimos anos, a eclosão de guerras em diferentes continentes, a pandemia de Covid-19 e os eventos climáticos extremos têm corroborado para a persistência das desigualdades. Estudos estimam que existam 700 milhões de pessoas em insegurança alimentar em todo o mundo, sendo que a maior parte delas se concentra nos países de África. De acordo com Carla Barroso, a principal dificuldade no enfrentamento desta grande questão está na consciencialização dos decisores, que deveriam atuar de forma coordenada.

“O governo precisa de desenhar políticas públicas, colocar recursos em programas de transferência de rendimentos, e o setor privado também. A fome está a deslocar-se do campo para a cidade, e o setor privado precisa de olhar com carinho para a possibilidade de investir no campo, para criar emprego”, sugeriu.

O Kremlin disse esta sexta-feira ter recebido com satisfação os comentários do candidato republicano à Presidência dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, sobre a Rússia ser ""uma máquina de guerra"" que derrotou Napoleão Bonaparte e Adolf Hitler, mas disse que não estava a usar óculos cor-de-rosa quando se tratava do candidato republicano.

O porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, estava a responder a uma pergunta sobre comentários que Trump disse ter feito ao presidente da Ucrânia, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, num telefonema a 19 de julho.

Mais tarde, Trump disse à Fox News que tinha dito a Zelenskiy que a guerra tinha de ser encerrada.

""Esta é uma máquina de guerra que vocês estão a enfrentar. É isso que eles (os russos) fazem, lutam em guerras. Venceram Hitler. Venceram Napoleão. Temos de acabar com esta guerra"", disse Trump.

Ao comentar as observações de Trump, Peskov disse: ""Provavelmente será útil para a maioria do público americano saber que há muitas páginas gloriosas na História da Rússia e, de facto, provavelmente poucas pessoas nos EUA, ou seja, americanos comuns e talvez representantes do chamado establishment político, conhecem a História com tanta profundidade"".

Mas Peskov, quando questionado de seguida sobre um comentário no Wall Street Journal com co-autoria de Mike Pompeo, antigo secretário de Estado de Trump, disse que o Kremlin tinha os olhos abertos quando se tratava de avaliar o que uma Presidência de Trump poderia significar para a Rússia.

O comentário de Pompeo sugeriu que Trump decretasse novas e duras sanções contra Moscovo, caso fosse eleito e aumentasse a ajuda à Ucrânia.

""Nunca usámos e não usamos óculos cor-de-rosa. (Trump) é um representante da elite política dos EUA, que está agora absolutamente a sofrer com o sentimento totalmente antirrusso"", disse Peskov.

""Quando ele era presidente, sob Trump, os americanos começaram esta corrida às sanções, sob Trump foi imposto um grande número de sanções contra o nosso país e, nesse aspeto, ele não é muito diferente para nós de todos os outros.""

O ribatejano Eduardo Oliveira e Sousa, portador do bigode mais viçoso e farfalhudo desta campanha eleitoral, deu nas vistas na passada semana e não foi só por causa da bem podada pilosidade supra labial. O cabeça-de-lista da AD por Santarém falou de “falsas razões de ordem climática” que obstaculizam investimentos, opinião que, logo por azar, muita gente actualmente não tolera. Ou, se tolera, tem receio de o proclamar em plena época venatória de caça ao voto, para não molestar as almas mais sensíveis como o enxame de comentadores políticos que se fartou de zurzir no empresário agro-florestal agora candidato a deputado.

O candidato da AD, que até há um ano liderou a poderosa Confederação dos Agricultores de Portugal (CAP) e o CNEMA em Santarém, limitou-se a partilhar aquilo que lhe ia na alma e que é sua convicção plena. Dele e de muita outra gente, diga-se. E em seu socorro, num gesto solidário que sugere que as notícias sobre as alterações climáticas são manifestamente exageradas, esteve também São Pedro. Nos dias seguintes às desassombradas declarações de Oliveira e Sousa o santo encarregado das coisas do clima brindou-nos com chuva, vento, frio e neve nas terras altas como que para demonstrar que a tradição ainda é o que era e o Inverno também. Quais alterações climáticas qual carapuça! No Carnaval até esteve a chover, lembram-se?

Nesse comício eleitoral em Ourém, Oliveira e Sousa enfatizou, aliás, que fenómenos climáticos extremos sempre os houve. E também enfatizou muito bem! Esses espíritos mais delicados e picuinhas que tivessem apanhado com uma Era glaciar quando não havia samarras alentejanas, salamandras ou sacos de água quente; ou que se tivessem confrontado com um dilúvio de dimensões bíblicas sem haver coletes salva-vidas, barbatanas e botes de borracha e iam ver o que é bom para a tosse.

Manel, tenho um passado de activista que desconhecia até há relativamente pouco tempo, o que acaba por me reconciliar com a minha juventude azougada e climaticamente irresponsável. Durante anos alimentei a ideia, e os remorsos, de que tinha cometido muitas patifarias e brincadeiras de gosto duvidoso, pelas quais teria que responder no dia do juízo final. Mas entretanto descobri que pouco ou nada me separava dos que hoje são denominados activistas climáticos (e de outras causas) e que gozam até de uma certa simpatia e reputação social, nomeadamente entre a juventude.

A malta hoje faz t(r)inta por uma linha - desde cortar estradas, vandalizar instalações, atirar ovos e tinta a pessoas - e todas essas práticas, a que alguns noutros tempos chamariam vandalismo, delinquência ou arruaça, são hoje manifestações de activismo porque praticadas pelos eufemisticamente designados activistas. Enfim, liberdades semânticas que me ajudam a apaziguar a consciência e a reflectir melhor em quem votar...

A ministra do Meio Ambiente, Marina Silva, participou numa audiência na Comissão de Agricultura da Câmara na quarta-feira (16). A ministra defendeu o aumento do orçamento e novas medidas para combater as queimadas. Apesar disso, a política ambiental do governo foi alvo de diversas críticas.

A audiência ocorreu no meio de críticas da oposição, que cobrou maior efetividade nas políticas ambientais. Deputados como Julia Zanatta (PL-SC) destacaram a falta de controlo sobre as queimadas e criticaram a condução do governo nas questões ambientais.

“Muitas das dificuldades que a senhora está a enfrentar eu passei na época do ministério. Por uma questão de enviesamento ideológico, secretarias de estado e órgãos federais não permitiam, por exemplo, que se fizesse a queimada prescrita ou controlada no momento certo”, explicou a deputada.

Marina Silva destacou a necessidade de respostas rápidas e propôs uma estratégia nacional para enfrentar eventos climáticos extremos. A ministra também reforçou a importância de fortalecer a governação climática e intensificar o combate ao desmatamento e queimadas ilegais.

“Aumentando os orçamentos, aumentando a nossa governação, inclusive criando novos paradigmas, como esse que falei sobre emergência antecipada: se decretarmos emergência climática antecipadamente, podemos armazenar cestas básicas, alimentos, combustível e medicamentos até três a quatro meses antes”, argumentou a ministra.

A ministra defendeu a retomada de políticas ambientais de governos anteriores e o fortalecimento de órgãos como o Ibama e ICMBio, responsáveis por fiscalizar e combater crimes ambientais.

A ministra também mencionou o decreto que cria a Comissão Nacional para Redução das Queimadas, com foco em biomas como a Amazónia e o Pantanal, visando coordenar esforços para prevenir queimadas ilegais e desastres climáticos.

O deputado Evair Vieira de Melo (PP-ES) repudiou as falas de Marina, que considerou como “vitimismo”.

“Eu quero repudiar a forma de vitimização com que, mais uma vez, essa ministra se comporta aqui. Tenho de dar os parabéns a quem a treinou para ter essa postura”, afirmou Evair de Melo.

A base aliada defendeu as ações ambientais, ressaltando a conciliação entre proteção e desenvolvimento económico, com foco na redução de emissões e agricultura sustentável. A oposição criticou, afirmando que as políticas enfraquecem o agronegócio.

Marina encerrou reafirmando o compromisso com o diálogo e com o desenvolvimento sustentável, sem comprometer o crescimento económico.

O estudante e ativista climático Vicente Fernandes enfrenta a possibilidade de ter de indemnizar o primeiro-ministro, Luís Montenegro, no valor de 1750 euros, após atirar tinta verde ao político durante um ato de campanha eleitoral. O incidente, ocorrido a 28 de fevereiro, resultou na danificação do fato Hugo Boss usado por Montenegro, e está agora a ser julgado no Campus da Justiça, em Lisboa, onde Vicente responde pelo ato. A segunda audiência do julgamento tem lugar esta quarta-feira, para ouvir as testemunhas de defesa.

A situação surge num contexto em que ativistas climáticos, ligados ao movimento Greve Climática Estudantil (GCE), exigem um plano nacional para a eliminação de combustíveis fósseis até 2030. A GCE emitiu um comunicado em apoio ao estudante e convocou uma vigília à porta do tribunal, expressando solidariedade para com Vicente e reafirmando a sua posição contra o uso de combustíveis fósseis.

O caso levou a uma audiência inicial a 9 de outubro, na qual Luís Montenegro apresentou o pedido de indemnização de 1750 euros, justificado pela danificação do seu fato. Contudo, Montenegro não é o único a requerer compensações: Isabel Santiago, fotógrafa do então candidato, também reclama uma indemnização de mais de 450 euros, devido a danos causados ao seu equipamento durante a ação. Além disso, um agente da polícia, que interveio na altura, apresentou um pedido adicional de indemnização, referindo que as manchas de tinta na sua roupa não foram removidas apesar das lavagens.

Vicente Fernandes, que gritou “Montenegro defende a indústria fóssil” antes de lançar a tinta verde, foi imediatamente detido pelas forças policiais. No tribunal, o jovem argumentou que a tinta utilizada era à base de água, “lavável e ecológica”, afirmando ainda ter conseguido remover facilmente as manchas do seu próprio vestuário, que usava na altura e que continuou a usar após o incidente.

Em defesa do protesto, Vicente explicou que a sua intenção era alertar para o impacto do uso continuado de combustíveis fósseis, especialmente face a fenómenos climáticos extremos, como as cheias recentes em Valência, que descreveu como “uma destruição de dimensão nunca antes vista”. Num comunicado divulgado pelo GCE, Vicente enfatizou: “A menos que cortemos drasticamente as emissões de gases de efeito estufa, as próximas vítimas poderemos ser nós ou alguém que amamos, e desastres como este só irão piorar enquanto os governos nada fizerem para pôr um fim aos combustíveis fósseis.”

O caso ocorre num momento em que o movimento estudantil tem intensificado a sua campanha em prol do fim ao fóssil até 2030. Segundo Matilde Ventura, porta-voz da GCE e testemunha no julgamento, a organização tem vindo a recolher assinaturas em escolas de todo o país para uma “Carta de Estudantes pelo Fim ao Fóssil”. Ventura afirma: “Exigimos que o nosso governo apresente um plano para acabar com a queima e uso de combustíveis fósseis no nosso país até 2030, através de uma transição justa.”

Os estudantes envolvidos na GCE estão determinados a pressionar o governo. Segundo afirmam, caso o executivo não atenda às suas exigências, estão a planear iniciar uma paralisação das escolas a partir de abril de 2024, como forma de protesto contínuo.",PT,"['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities']","['CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of political organizations and figures', 'CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other', 'CC: Criticism of institutions and authorities: Criticism of national governments']",ativista atirar tinta montenegro arriscar pagar euro estragar fato marca luxo estudante ativista climático vicente Fernandes enfrentar possibilidade indemnizar primeiro-ministro Luís montenegro euro atirar tinta verde político durante ato campanha eleitoral incidente ocorrer fevereiro resultar danificação fato hugo Boss usar montenegro julgar campus justiça Lisboa vicente respondir ato audiência julgamento quarta-feira ouvir testemunha defesa situação surgir contexto ativista climático ligar movimento Greve climático estudantil gce exigir plano nacional eliminação combustível fóssil gce emitir comunicado estudante convocar vigília porta tribunal expressar solidariedade vicente reafirmar uso combustível fóssil caso levar audiência inicial outubro Luís montenegro apresentar pedido indemnização euro justificar danificação fato montenegro único requerer compensação isabel Santiago fotógrafar candidato reclamar indemnização euro devido dano causar equipamento durante ação agente polícia intervir altura apresentar pedido adicional indemnização referir mancha tinta roupa removir apesar lavagem vicente Fernandes gritar montenegro defender indústria fóssil lançar tinta verde imediatamente deter força policial tribunal jovem argumentar tinta utilizar base água lavável ecológica afirmar conseguir remover facilmente mancha vestuário usar altura continuar incidente defesa protesto vicente explicar intenção alertar impacto uso continuar combustível fóssil especialmente face fenómeno climático extremo cheia recente valência descrever destruição dimensão ver comunicado divulgar gce vicente enfatizar cortemos drasticamente emissão gases efeito estufa próximo vítima poder alguém amamos desastr ir piorar governo fizer pôr combustível fóssil caso ocorrer movimento estudantil intensificar campanha prol fóssil matilde venturo porta-voz gce testemunhar julgamento organização recolher assinatura escola país carta estudante fóssil ventura afirmar exigir governo apresente plano acabar queima uso combustível fóssil país transição justo estudante envolver gce determinar pressionar governo afirmar caso executivo atendar exigência planear paralisação escola abril protesto contínuo

A Rússia não rejeita liminarmente participar numa futura conferência de paz com a Ucrânia, mas quer perceber primeiro o enquadramento do encontro sugerido esta semana pelo Presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky.

O Kremlin respondeu nesta terça-feira à proposta avançada na véspera por Zelensky de que a Rússia deveria estar presente numa segunda cimeira de paz que, provavelmente, poderia ser marcada para Novembro.

“A primeira cimeira de paz não foi de todo uma cimeira de paz, portanto, talvez seja necessário primeiro perceber o que é que ele quer dizer”, afirmou nesta terça-feira o porta-voz do Kremlin, Dmitri Peskov, em entrevista ao canal militar Zvezda, citado pelo Moscow Times.

Peskov referia-se à conferência organizada pela Suíça em Junho, nos Alpes, para a qual nenhum dirigente russo foi convidado. Na altura, essa foi uma exigência de Zelensky, que se recusava a sentar-se à mesa com representantes da potência que ocupa parte do território ucraniano.

Moscovo criticou a falta de convite e vários países decidiram não marcar presença na conferência, incluindo a China, o principal aliado diplomático da Rússia. Outras nações do Sul Global que estiveram presentes acabaram por não subscrever o comunicado final, dando um golpe às ambições de Kiev e dos seus parceiros ocidentais de apresentar um respaldo forte a nível mundial ao plano de paz de Zelensky.

Apesar da ausência de convite à Rússia na cimeira da Suíça, nunca ficou excluída uma futura participação de representantes russos em encontros futuros.

Ainda assim, é difícil perceber o que poderá aproximar as posições dos dois países em eventuais conversações. A Ucrânia exige uma retirada militar imediata da Rússia dos territórios ocupados, enquanto Moscovo quer o reconhecimento das anexações das quatro províncias que ocupa parcialmente.

As declarações de Zelensky esta semana acontecem numa altura em que a Rússia vai conseguindo alcançar alguns progressos no campo de batalha, sobretudo no Donbass, que é o objectivo primordial da invasão iniciada em Fevereiro de 2022.",PT,"['URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian government and officials and policies', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia has international support from a number of countries and people', 'URW: Discrediting the West, Diplomacy: Diplomacy does/will not work', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other']",Rússia perceber cimeira paz pretender zelensky Rússia rejeitar liminarmente participar futuro conferência paz ucrânia perceber enquadramento encontro sugerir semana presidente ucraniano volodymyr zelensky kremlin responder terça-feira proposta avançar véspera zelensky Rússia dever presente cimeira paz provavelmente poder marcar novembro cimeira paz cimeira paz ser necessário perceber afirmar terça-feira porta-voz kremlin Dmitri Peskov entrevista canal militar zvezda citar moscow time Peskov referia se conferência organizar suíça junho alpe nenhum dirigente russo convidar altura exigência zelensky recusar sentar se mesa representante potência ocupar território ucraniano moscovo criticar convite país decidir marcar presença conferência incluir china principal aliado diplomático Rússia nação sul global presente acabar subscrever comunicado dar golpe ambição kiev parceiro ocidental apresentar respaldo forte mundial plano paz zelensky apesar ausência convite Rússia cimeira suíço ficar excluído futuro participação representante russo encontro futuro difícil perceber aproximar posição país eventual conversação ucrânia exigir retirada militar imediato Rússia território ocupar Moscovo reconhecimento anexação província ocupar parcialmente declaração zelensky semana acontecer altura Rússia conseguir alcançar progresso campo batalha sobretudo donbass objectivo primordial invasão iniciar fevereiro

Três em cada quatro jovens dos 16 aos 25 anos consideram o “futuro climático assustador” e temem que os líderes mundiais não consigam implementar medidas eficazes. O dado é do inquérito Young People’s Voices on Climate Anxiety, Government Betrayal and Moral Injury: A Global Phenomenon, que entrevistou 10 mil pessoas, de países como os EUA, Índia, França, Nigéria e Brasil, em setembro. O inquérito mostrou ainda que 45% destes jovens se sentem angustiados, sobrecarregados, ansiosos e culpados em relação ao ambiente.

São números que explicam e refletem o protagonismo que os jovens estão a reivindicar – ainda à força – nas decisões de combate à crise climática. “Os nossos líderes não são os nossos líderes. É assim que um líder deve parecer”, disse Greta Thunberg, apontando para os milhares de jovens que a escutavam em Glasgow.

Em Glasgow, os jovens de todo o mundo pediram mais participação e representação nas negociações. Uma declaração assinada por 40 mil deles foi entregue à presidência da COP e a outros dirigentes. “As ações e o escrutínio dos jovens são fundamentais para mantermos viva a meta dos 1,5 graus centígrados e criarmos um futuro sem emissões”, afirmou Alok Sharma, presidente da Conferência.

Na delegação brasileira estavam cerca de 80 jovens, a maior representação juvenil até à data. E a única brasileira a participar na cerimónia de abertura da COP-26 foi Txai Suruí, uma jovem indígena de 24 anos. Partilhou o palco com António Guterres, secretário-geral da ONU, e Boris Johnson, primeiro-ministro britânico, e discursou para diplomatas de mais de 190 países.

No seu discurso, Txai citou o assassinato de Ari Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, seu amigo e guardião indígena morto em 2020 por proteger a natureza, e alertou para a urgência de mudanças. “Hoje o tempo está a aquecer; os animais estão a desaparecer; os rios estão a morrer; as nossas plantações não florescem como antes. A Terra está a falar. Ela diz-nos que não temos mais tempo.”

O principal diplomata da União Europeia, Josep Borrell, retirou esta segunda-feira da Hungria uma reunião dos ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros da UE, que iria decorrer em Budapeste, numa reação do bloco à aproximação do país à Rússia sobre a guerra na Ucrânia.

Borrel disse que o encontro no final de agosto vai agora ter lugar em Bruxelas, depois de o primeiro-ministro húngaro, Viktor Orbán, ter visitado Moscovo e Pequim sem o apoio da UE, e dizer que o seu governo definiu a política europeia como ""pró-guerra "".

""Temos de enviar um sinal, ainda que simbólico"", disse Borrell aos jornalistas em Bruxelas, na última reunião dos ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros, antes das férias de verão.

Orbán iniciou a viagem, que incluiu também uma visita ao candidato republicano à Presidência dos Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, apenas dias depois de a Hungria ter assumido a Presidência rotativa da UE, no passado dia 1 de julho.

Na reunião desta segunda-feira, vários ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros manifestaram uma forte condenação ao ministro húngaro, Peter Szijjarto, segundo as autoridades.

""Isto foi feito de forma muito clara e reiterada para não deixar margem para dúvidas"", disse o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros português, Paulo Rangel.

Vários países europeus consideram a Hungria muito próxima de Moscovo, sabotando os esforços da UE para isolar a Rússia, política e diplomaticamente, devido à invasão da Ucrânia. A Hungria afirma que procura levar a paz à Ucrânia o mais rapidamente possível.

O Presidente Vladimir Putin afirmou que o maior objetivo do Ministério da Defesa russo é “expulsar o inimigo do nosso território” e “desalojar” as tropas ucranianas das regiões fronteiriças. “Não existem dúvidas de que alcançaremos os nossos objetivos”, declarou, citado pela BBC News, durante a transmissão na televisão estatal russa de uma reunião com altos-funcionários de segurança e defesa sobre a situação nas regiões fronteiriças.

Putin garante que o objetivo da ofensiva ucraniana era melhorar a sua posição negocial e travar o avanço da Rússia, mas que em troca “receberá, sem dúvida, uma resposta digna”. O ataque de Kiev foi uma “provocação em grande escala”, que envolveu o “bombardeamento indiscriminado de edifícios civis, casas residenciais e ambulâncias”, acusou ainda o Presidente russo.

“As perdas têm vindo a aumentar dramaticamente nas forças armadas da Ucrânia, particularmente nas unidades mais capazes que o inimigo tem enviado para a nossa fronteira”, disse o Presidente aos oficiais presentes na reunião.

O governador interino de Kursk, Alexei Smirnov, indica que a Ucrânia controla 28 aldeias na região, tendo provocado 12 mortes e 121 feridos. “A situação continua difícil”, admite ao acrescentar que o exército ucraniano invadiu 12 quilómetros do território em profundidade e possui uma linha da frente com 40 quilómetros de extensão. Neste momento foi interrompido pelo Presidente russo que pediu ao governador para descrever “como a população está a ser ajudada”.

Mais de 120 mil pessoas já foram retiradas de Kursk, mas ainda falta evacuar 59 mil. Cerca de 2.000 cidadãos russos estão nas zonas ocupadas pela Ucrânia em Kursk. “Não sabemos nada sobre o seu destino”, disse ainda o governador.",PT,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Russia is the Victim', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Other', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military']",putin alertar ucrâni receber resposta digno devido provocação escalar presidente vladimir putin afirmar objetivo ministério defesa russo expulsar inimigo território desalojar tropa ucraniano região fronteiriça existir dúvida alcançare objetivo declarar citar bbc news durante transmissão televisão estatal russo reunião altos-funcionário segurança defesa situação região fronteiriça putin garantir objetivo ofensiva ucraniano melhorar negocial travar avanço Rússia troca receber dúvida resposta digno ataque kiev provocação escala envolver bombardeamento indiscriminar edifício civil casa residencial ambulância acusar presidente russo perda aumentar dramaticamente força armar ucrânia particularmente unidade capaz inimigo enviar fronteira dizer presidente oficial presente reunião governador interino kursk alexeir smirnov indicar ucrânia controlo aldeia região ter provocar morte ferido situação continuar difícil admitir acrescentar exército ucraniano invadir quilómetro território profundidade possuir linha frente quilómetro extensão interromper presidente russo pedir governador descrever população ajudar pessoa retirar kursk evacuar cerca cidadão russo zona ocupar ucrânia kursk saber destino dizer governador

A escassez de água tem levado algumas ilhas gregas a proibir o uso de piscinas e a recorrer à dessalinização. Apenas semanas após a Grécia ter enfrentado a sua onda de calor mais precoce de sempre, em junho, várias partes do país estão agora a lidar com uma nova crise: graves escassez de água.

Foi declarada situação de emergência em Sifnos, nas Cíclades, Leros, nas ilhas do Dodecaneso, Sami, em Cefalônia, e em partes de Creta.

Os habitantes destas regiões estão a exigir uma intervenção urgente, à medida que os recursos hídricos se esgotam. Os níveis de água também estão baixos na península da Ática, que abrange Atenas.

Na ilha de Naxos, no sul do Egeu, o maior reservatório secou devido à baixa pluviosidade e ao clima quente, segundo a agência de notícias Reuters.

A falta de chuva nos últimos meses, combinada com temperaturas escaldantes de até 40ºC, provocou esta situação. A infraestrutura inadequada e a falta de manutenção das unidades de dessalinização nas ilhas agravaram ainda mais o problema.

Os incêndios florestais também contribuíram para a crise. Em junho, um incêndio em Serifos destruiu parte da rede de abastecimento de água da ilha, que agora enfrenta as suas reservas de água mais baixas em 20 anos.

Com a necessidade máxima de água para abastecimento e irrigação, os agricultores são os mais afetados. Muitos estão a ser forçados a recorrer a poços contaminados por água do mar devido aos baixos níveis de água, relata a Reuters.

Com a temporada turística em pleno andamento, a infraestrutura para visitantes está a pressionar ainda mais os recursos hídricos. A construção aumentada e o uso descontrolado de piscinas contribuíram para a escassez de água nas ilhas, afirmou Elissavet Feloni, hidróloga e professora na Universidade da Ática Ocidental, ao canal grego Naftemporiki.

O mês passado foi o junho mais quente já registado globalmente e o 13º mês consecutivo de temperaturas recorde, segundo o serviço climático europeu Copernicus. Foi também o 12º mês seguido em que o mundo esteve 1,5ºC mais quente do que nos tempos pré-industriais, extremos atribuídos às emissões causadas pelo homem.

Com a expectativa de que as condições secas persistam nos próximos meses, Feloni pediu controlos sobre o consumo de água e uma monitorização governamental mais rigorosa.

Algumas ilhas já tomaram medidas por conta própria. Karpathos e Serifos impuseram restrições ao reabastecimento de piscinas. Em Viannos, em Creta, foram estabelecidos limites rigorosos ao uso de água para irrigação.

A pequena ilha do Dodecaneso, Lipsi, antecipou-se e proibiu a construção de piscinas no verão quente de 2023 para incentivar uma abordagem mais sustentável ao turismo.

A ilha de Thassos, no norte, está a investir numa planta de dessalinização para tornar a água do mar potável, segundo a Reuters.

Em locais onde foi declarada situação de emergência, os processos para transferência de água, melhoria do abastecimento e acesso a fundos governamentais foram acelerados.

Estão previstos três novos poços em Creta, enquanto a marinha transportou água para Leros, de acordo com relatos da imprensa local.

Haniyeh era um líder que conversava, disse Amorim. ""O Hamas praticou uma ação terrorista [contra Israel, em outubro de 2023] que condenamos, sem qualquer dúvida. Mas não é tratado na maioria da região como um grupo terrorista. É tratado como um partido político, talvez mais radical, que frequenta a Turquia, um membro da NATO, e o Irão.""

""O nosso problema é com o governo de Netanyahu"". O conselheiro da Presidência teceu ainda críticas ao primeiro-ministro de Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. ""Não se pode confundir o povo judeu, o governo de Netanyahu e o Estado de Israel. Se ele [Netanyahu] sai do poder, pode ser que seja preso, há várias acusações sobre ele... A guerra é uma forma de ele se manter no poder.""

Haniyeh era procurado pelo Tribunal Penal Internacional. A 20 de maio, foram emitidos mandados de detenção contra o líder político e principal interlocutor do Hamas por crimes contra a humanidade cometidos desde 7 de outubro. A mesma decisão do Tribunal emitiu também um mandado contra Netanyahu.

Rússia x Ucrânia

Amorim afirmou que ""adotar a posição principista e radical da Ucrânia"" não resolverá o conflito do país com a Rússia. O diplomata defendeu a proposta de negociação assinada pelo Brasil e pela China no final de maio. Segundo disse, com o impasse na tentativa de procurar uma resolução com base no que propõe o presidente ucraniano, Volodymyr Zelensky, o plano elaborado por Brasília e Pequim começa a ser notado por outros países.

Há uma sintonia positiva entre o Brasil e a China, que são grandes países, defendem a Carta da ONU, defendem a não intervenção, defendem a integridade territorial. Implicitamente, aí há várias críticas à Rússia, mas também não adianta adotar-se a posição principista e radical da Ucrânia, que não vai resultar.

Celso Amorim, assessor de Lula para assuntos internacionais

No final de maio, Amorim deslocou-se à China e assinou com o ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros chinês, Wang Yi, o documento denominado ""Entendimentos Comuns entre o Brasil e a China sobre uma Resolução Política para a Crise na Ucrânia"". O texto traz seis pontos que devem ser considerados para a solução da guerra e o apoio de ambos os países à realização de uma conferência internacional de paz ""num momento apropriado"".

Venezuela

Na entrevista, Amorim disse ainda que a demora do Comité Nacional Eleitoral desiludiu as autoridades brasileiras. O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros afirmou ainda acreditar que a organização sem fins lucrativos que acompanha as eleições em todo o mundo, o Centro Carter, ""não é manipulada"".

O assessor da Presidência disse ainda que o contexto venezuelano agrava a situação. ""Em qualquer país, o ónus da prova está em quem acusa. Mas, no caso da Venezuela, o ónus da prova está em quem é acusado, em quem é objeto de suspeição. Em função de tudo o que já aconteceu, de todo o quadro político, há a expectativa de que a Venezuela e o governo venezuelano possam provar a votação que ele afirma ter tido.""

Afirmou que as atas poderão sanar dúvidas em relação à contagem eleitoral. ""Perguntei isso [sobre as atas] ao presidente Maduro, que disse que era uma questão de dois ou três dias"", afirmou Amorim ao apresentador.

Os trabalhadores do Texas ao Ohio beneficiam da campanha de Washington para fornecer armas a Kiev, afirmou Lloyd Austin.

O conflito na Ucrânia é ""uma bênção para a economia dos EUA"", uma vez que permitiu a criação de mais empregos no sector militar-industrial norte-americano, afirmou o secretário da Defesa, Lloyd Austin.  Falando numa reunião do Conselho de Concorrência da Casa Branca na terça-feira (5), o chefe do Pentágono prometeu que Washington continuaria a pressionar por uma indústria de defesa mais forte, especialmente à luz do conflito entre a Ucrânia e a Rússia.

Austin afirmou que a assistência militar norte-americana a Kiev não só ""salvou vidas"" e manteve a Ucrânia na luta, como também fortaleceu a economia dos EUA.

""Estes investimentos expandiram as instalações e criaram empregos para os trabalhadores norte-americanos. E as armas que enviamos para a Ucrânia para ajudar a defender-se são fabricadas nos [Estados Unidos da] América por trabalhadores norte-americanos em todo o país — do Texas a Ohio e ao Arizona"", acrescentou a autoridade.

O conflito na Ucrânia também destacou a necessidade de melhorar a produção militar, segundo Austin, que enfatizou a coordenação com os aliados de Washington. Exortou ainda os legisladores norte-americanos a adotarem um pacote de segurança nacional que destinaria 60 mil milhões de dólares (cerca de 55 mil milhões de euros) a Kiev. O projeto de lei continua parado no Congresso devido à oposição dos republicanos, que exigiram que a Casa Branca resolvesse a crise de segurança na fronteira com o México.

Os EUA têm sido o principal apoiante militar da Ucrânia, fornecendo a Kiev cerca de 45 mil milhões de dólares (cerca de 223,1 mil milhões de reais) em armas entre janeiro de 2022 e janeiro de 2024, enquanto os compromissos totais atingiram mais de US$ 70 mil milhões (aproximadamente 64 mil milhões de euros), de acordo com o Instituto de Kiel para a Economia Mundial. Os relatórios sugerem que a pressão dos EUA para armar a Ucrânia colocou uma pressão significativa sobre os arsenais do próprio país.

Embora os responsáveis da administração do Presidente Joe Biden tenham defendido que a maior parte dos fundos para a Ucrânia está a ser gasta dentro dos EUA, alguns republicanos criticaram a Casa Branca por alocar dólares dos contribuintes a países estrangeiros, em vez de resolver diretamente os problemas internos.

De acordo com uma sondagem de Dezembro realizada pelo Pew Research Center, 31% dos norte-americanos acreditam que os EUA estão a prestar demasiado apoio à Ucrânia, enquanto 29% dizem que o atual nível de assistência é o correto.

A Rússia tem denunciado repetidamente os envios de armas ocidentais para a Ucrânia, alertando que apenas irão prolongar o conflito. A representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova, disse em dezembro que os EUA provavelmente continuariam a alimentar o conflito na Ucrânia em 2024, desde que conseguissem retirar fundos aos contribuintes norte-americanos.

Mário Machado, conhecido ex-líder dos skinheads neonazis em Portugal, condenado a penas de prisão por vários crimes, disse nas redes sociais que se a Polónia evocar o art°5 da NATO e os seus 3 filhos em idade militar forem chamados para a “guerra”, todos os comunistas em Portugal passam a ser alvos legítimos. O que não deixa de ser uma contradição pois o partido comunista português, ao contrário da maioria parlamentar, é contra a integração de Portugal na NATO, e a Rússia Unida, partido de Vladimir Putin, tem a maioria absoluta na Duma Federal (325 lugares), é um partido nacionalista, conservador, populista, tem afiliação na Internacional Democrata Centrista, adversário do partido comunista russo, que tem apenas 57 lugares.

O apoiante de André Ventura baseou-se na notícia que a Rússia tinha atingido a Polónia com 2 mísseis, notícia já desmentida pela Polónia, que afinal atribui o “acidente infeliz” à Ucrânia.

Apesar da Rússia já não ser comunista há muitos anos, e apesar de existirem vários cheganos que também estão do lado de Putin, que o diga a deputada municipal do Chega em Cascais, Maria Vieira, Mário Machado vira os alvos para os comunistas portugueses: 

A Rússia atingiu a Polónia com 2 mísseis, assassinando 2 pessoas. Se a Polónia evocar o art°5 da NATO, e 3 dos meus filhos em idade militar forem chamados, todos os comunistas em Portugal passam a ser alvos legítimos.

Como é possível ignorar tão claros sinais e considerar que se deve travar a transição energética, consumindo mais combustíveis fósseis? É uma lamentável reação que se desenha em vários países europeus.

Trata-se de uma forma de negar o que é óbvio. Há anos atrás ainda era possível considerar uma fantasia o imperativo de reduzir a emissão de CO2. Agora, negar o que está à vista exige um maior esforço, que, no entanto, alguns fazem para não serem incomodados.

A transição energética tem custos, que é mais cómodo ignorar. Provavelmente quem assim reage julga que a tragédia final apenas acontecerá quando já não estiver por cá. Assim se condenam as gerações futuras. Trata-se de um egoísmo irresponsável.

Desgraçadamente, os líderes políticos nem sempre estão à altura da crise que avança. Preferem não incomodar as pessoas e assim evitam as medidas drásticas que são necessárias.

Por isso a esperança está na capacidade de protesto das jovens gerações, de maneira a forçarem os políticos a assumirem as suas responsabilidades, em vez de continuarem tranquilamente a agirem como se não fosse urgentíssima a transição energética.

PT_317.txt,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears,CC: Amplifying Climate Fears: Other,"Rondónia declara situação de emergência por incêndios florestais

O governo da Rondónia declarou situação de emergência devido a incêndios florestais. O decreto foi publicado no Diário Oficial do estado. O texto cita ""situação crítica de seca"" que atinge a região desde o segundo semestre de 2023, devido à redução significativa das chuvas.

Este ano, Rondónia registou 4197 focos de incêndios nas cidades e 690 em áreas de conservação, totalizando 4887 focos, o dobro do anotado em 2023. Fogo destruiu 107216 hectares de floresta.

De acordo com a publicação, a escassez de chuva tenderá a persistir durante, pelo menos, mais três meses, “provocando uma redução severa do nível dos rios e da humidade relativa do ar, aumentando significativamente o número e os riscos de incêndios florestais e de incêndios urbanos, além de agravar os danos para a saúde pública e para o ambiente”.

Focos de calor

Dados de 2024 apontam para um aumento de 43,2% dos focos de calor na Amazónia em comparação com o mesmo período de 2023, sendo a Rondónia uma das áreas mais afetadas da região, com um aumento de 23,7% dos focos de incêndio apenas em agosto. O governo do Estado teve em consideração ainda:

- prejuízos económicos e sociais para a população afetada e a imperiosidade de salvaguardar a dignidade da pessoa humana com o atendimento das suas necessidades básicas;

- que as equipas de combate aos incêndios florestais enfrentam consideráveis desafios de acesso às regiões afetadas, especialmente em áreas isoladas, nas quais a infraestrutura de transporte terrestre e fluvial é inexistente ou severamente limitada, impedindo a chegada rápida e eficiente dos recursos necessários para controlar as chamas;

- que o panorama dos incêndios na Rondónia se tornou extremamente preocupante, com números que superam significativamente os registados em anos anteriores, contabilizando, no período de 1 de janeiro a 19 de agosto de 2024, 4197 focos de incêndios nos municípios e 690 em áreas de conservação do Estado, totalizando 4887 focos, o dobro do registado em 2023. Aproximadamente 107216 hectares de floresta foram destruídos pelo fogo;

- que a seca hidrológica excecional impactou dramaticamente o Rio Madeira, que registou níveis excessivamente baixos, cenário que representa um dos anos mais desafiantes para a Amazónia, sendo a Rondónia um dos estados mais afetados. A escassez de chuvas, associada ao fenómeno El Niño e às alterações climáticas, criou condições propícias à expansão descontrolada dos incêndios;

- a intensidade dos desastres exigirá uma resposta não prevista nos planeamentos anuais e plurianuais, impactando substancialmente os orçamentos das secretarias de estado e comprometendo as ações de resposta aos desastres previstos para este período;

- que as populações vulneráveis - crianças, idosos, grávidas, indivíduos com doenças cardiorrespiratórias pré-existentes, pessoas de baixo nível socioeconómico e trabalhadores expostos ao ar livre - estão em maior risco de sofrer efeitos adversos relacionados com a poluição do ar.

“A declaração de emergência é motivada pelos intensos incêndios florestais e pela baixa humidade relativa do ar que afetam o território nacional, prejudicando tanto as populações urbanas e rurais, como as áreas de proteção ambiental, provocando impactos significativos nas atividades agrícolas, pecuárias, na navegabilidade dos rios e noutras atividades económicas e essenciais para a população.”

O ""plano de vitória"" apresentado por Vladimir Zelensky não faz mais do que empurrar os Estados-membros da NATO para um conflito direto com a Rússia, declarou a representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Maria Zakharova.

Antes, esta quarta-feira (16), Zelensky apresentou ao Parlamento ucraniano o chamado ""plano de vitória"" composto por cinco pontos, incluindo o convite à Ucrânia para a Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO) antes do fim do conflito e a proposta aos países ocidentais para implementarem ""um pacote de dissuasão não nuclear"" no território ucraniano.

""Um dos pontos do reforço da defesa ucraniana: Zelensky vai conseguir isso, como ele disse, através de operações específicas em certos lugares [...]. Como é que ele quer conseguir isso? Prejudicando a aviação russa juntamente com os seus parceiros. Por outras palavras, ele está a empurrar os membros da NATO para um conflito direto com o nosso país [Rússia] e insiste novamente em obter a permissão para utilizar armas de longo alcance em território russo"", disse Zakharova comentando um dos pontos do plano.

A representante oficial do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo destacou que o plano visa essencialmente receber dinheiro e mostrar as ""capacidades terroristas"" de Kiev. ""Penso que hoje Zelensky mostrou definitivamente a todos que odeia os ucranianos a um grau que pode ser descrito como 'ucraninofobia'"", sublinhou.

Zelensky informou anteriormente que o seu plano está totalmente preparado e contém também ""um poderoso pacote de medidas para forçar a Rússia a terminar o conflito diplomaticamente"".

Desde 24 de fevereiro de 2022 que a Rússia prossegue uma operação militar especial na Ucrânia, cujos objetivos são proteger a população do genocídio cometido por Kiev e enfrentar os riscos para a segurança nacional colocados pelo avanço da NATO para leste.

Muitos países apoiam Kiev com o fornecimento de armas, donativos, ajuda humanitária e sanções contra Moscovo. A Rússia, por sua vez, enviou notas de protesto a todos os países que fornecem armas ao país vizinho.

O ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo, Sergei Lavrov, alertou que os Estados ocidentais que apoiam a Ucrânia estão a tornar-se parte do conflito e que qualquer envio de armas para Kiev se tornará um alvo legítimo para as Forças Armadas russas.

Segundo o Kremlin, a política ocidental de fornecimento de armas à Ucrânia não contribui para as negociações entre a Rússia e a Ucrânia e apenas traz efeitos negativos.

As tropas russas conseguiram também provocar baixas e destruir equipamento de pelo menos 11 brigadas ucranianas nas cidades de Kleban-Byk, Selidovo, Dzerzhinsk, Nikolaevka, Lysovka, Tsukurino, Sukhaya Balka, Druzhba e Shevchenko, acrescentou o ministério.

O exército da Rússia encontra-se às portas de Toretsk, um importante centro logístico cuja captura facilitaria o aumento da pressão contra a cidade de Chasiv Yar, palco de combates durante vários meses devido à sua importância estratégica.

Na segunda-feira, o Presidente russo, Vladimir Putin, assinou um decreto que ordena o recrutamento de cerca de 133 mil pessoas para o serviço militar, entre outubro e dezembro, para reforçar a preparação militar da população em plena guerra.

“De 01 de outubro a 31 de dezembro de 2024, 133 mil cidadãos da Federação Russa com idades compreendidas entre os 18 e os 30 anos, que não estejam na reserva e estejam sujeitos ao serviço militar, serão convocados para o serviço militar”, refere o documento assinado pelo líder russo.

O vice-chefe da Direção Principal de Organização e Mobilização do Estado-Maior General das Forças Armadas Russas, Vladimir Tsimlyanski, esclareceu que os recrutas não serão enviados para a área da “operação militar especial”, um eufemismo pelo qual Moscovo se refere à invasão da Ucrânia.

O período de treino militar na Rússia é de 12 meses.

Durante a campanha de recrutamento da primavera passada, cerca de 150 mil russos foram convocados para o serviço militar obrigatório, de acordo com a agência de notícias russa Interfax.

Horas antes, Putin disse que todos os objetivos estabelecidos vão ser alcançados na Ucrânia, em declarações que marcaram o segundo ano da anexação de quatro regiões ucranianas pela Rússia.

“A verdade está do nosso lado. Todos os objetivos estabelecidos vão ser alcançados”, declarou o Presidente, num discurso gravado em vídeo em que felicitou o povo russo pelo “Dia da Reunificação”.

A Rússia assinalou na segunda-feira a anexação unilateral (e considerada ilegal pela Ucrânia e a maioria da comunidade internacional) de Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporijia e Kherson, regiões ucranianas que Moscovo apenas controla de forma parcial.

A Rússia invadiu a Ucrânia a 24 de fevereiro de 2022, com o argumento de proteger as minorias separatistas pró-russas no leste do país vizinho, independente desde 1991 – após a desagregação da antiga União Soviética – e que tem vindo a afastar-se do espaço de influência de Moscovo e a aproximar-se da Europa e do Ocidente.",PT,"['URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine', 'URW: Praise of Russia', 'URW: Russia is the Victim']","['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Russia is a guarantor of peace and prosperity', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Discrediting Ukrainian military', 'URW: Discrediting Ukraine: Other', 'URW: Praise of Russia: Other', 'URW: Russia is the Victim: Russia actions in Ukraine are only self-defence']",exército Rússia anunciar conquista cidade nelepovka leste ucrânia unidade Centro libertar povoação nelepovka república popular donetsk dizer ministério defesa russo comunicado divulgar plataforma mensagem telegr segunda-feira tropa russo conseguir provocar baixo destruir equipamento brigar ucraniano cidade kleban-byk selidovo dzerzhinsk em ikolaevka lysovka tsukurino sukhaya Balka Druzhba shevchenko acrescentar ministério exército Rússia encontrar se porta toretsk importante centro logístico captura facilitariar aumento pressão cidade chasiv yar palco combate durante devido importância estratégico segunda-feira presidente russo vladimir putin assinar decreto ordenar recrutamento cerca pessoa serviço militar outubro dezembro reforçar preparação militar população pleno guerra outubro dezembro cidadão federação russo idade compreender ano estar reserva estar sujeito serviço militar ser convocar serviço militar referir documento assinar líder russo vice-chefe direção principal organização mobilização estado-maior general força armar russo vladimir tsimlyanski esclarecer recruta ser enviar operação militar especial eufemismo Moscovo referir invasão ucrânia período treino militar Rússia durante campanha recrutamento primavera passado cerca russo convocar serviço militar obrigatório acordo agência notícia russo interfax hora putin dizer objetivo estabelecer alcançar ucrânia declaração marcar ano anexação região ucranianas Rússia verdade objetivo estabelecer alcançar declarar presidente discurso gravar vídeo felicitar russo dia reunificação Rússia assinalar segunda-feira anexação unilateral considerar ilegal ucrânia comunidade internacional Lugansk donetsk zaporijia kherson região ucraniano moscovo controlar parcial Rússia invadir ucrânia fevereiro argumento proteger minoria separatista pró-russa leste país vizinho independente desagregação antigo união soviético afastar se espaço influência Moscovo aproximar se Europa ocidente

No âmbito da Cooperação entre a Alemanha e Cabo Verde, o Instituto Leibniz de Investigação Troposférica (TROPOS), da Alemanha, vai construir, em parceria com instituições nacionais, um novo laboratório de Análise de Partículas de Aerossóis em Cabo Verde (São Vicente).

A ideia do Observatório de Cabo Verde surgiu da necessidade de se estabelecer na região da costa Ocidental Africana centros de acompanhamento, quer do oceano, quer da atmosfera, pois os fenómenos e composições da região são peculiares e importantes para a compreensão das interações entre a atmosfera e oceano.

Este observatório inclui vários laboratórios e irá proporcionar pela primeira vez, nesta região, oportunidades únicas para monitorizar condições meteorológicas extremas no solo e a grande altitude, episódios de poluição ou eventos de queima de poeiras minerais e biomassa, e processos de interação oceano-atmosfera relevantes compreender as alterações climáticas e os efeitos associados na saúde.

Os dados gerados (Aerosol, Clouds and Trace gases Research Infrastructure) serão disponibilizados às partes interessadas locais, regionais e internacionais através de plataformas de dados de acesso aberto para ajudar na elaboração de políticas e na monitorização da eficácia dos regulamentos relativos à qualidade do ar, otimizando as previsões meteorológicas regionais e compreendendo a evolução dos constituintes atmosféricos de curta duração de particular importância.

O Governo está ciente do estado de emergência climática em que o mundo se encontra, impactando negativamente os meios de subsistência, as economias, os ecossistemas e o bem-estar das pessoas. Como tal, o Governo defende uma atitude responsável de todos e desenho de políticas e tomadas de decisões baseadas na ciência na melhor ciência disponível, sempre que possível. É com esta visão que Cabo Verde acolhe este Observatório, contribuindo desta forma para o objetivo global de combate às alterações climáticas.

O acto de lançamento da primeira pedra do Observatório Atmosférico de Cabo Verde, terá lugar amanhã, dia 5 de Outubro em São Vicente, enquadrado na visita do Presidente da Alemanha, Sr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, a Cabo Verde.

O Ministério da Defesa da Rússia anunciou no sábado que as forças russas tomaram o controlo da povoação de Lozuvatske, no setor de Pokrovsk, na região de Donetsk, na Ucrânia, local de algumas das batalhas mais acirradas na linha de frente da guerra que já dura há 29 meses.

O Estado-Maior da Ucrânia não mencionou a povoação no seu relatório, mas apontou que a área ao redor desta foi tomada por combates pesados. Fontes militares não oficiais relataram a perda de pelo menos duas outras localidades no setor.

As forças russas têm avançado lentamente pela região de Donetsk, no leste da Ucrânia, com ganhos constantes e incrementais desde que tomaram a cidade-chave de Avdiivka em fevereiro.

O Ministério da Defesa russo disse que o grupo ""central"" de forças da Rússia capturou Lozuvatske, a noroeste do centro regional de Donetsk, que é controlado pelos russos.

A Rússia afirmou ainda que as suas forças lançaram ataques em outras localidades do setor e repeliram três contra-ataques ucranianos.

As autoridades ucranianas têm relatado há várias semanas que o setor de Pokrovsk está a ser tomado pelos combates mais pesados ao longo da linha de frente de mil quilómetros.

O presidente Volodymyr Zelenskiy debateu o setor duas vezes na quinta-feira com o seu principal comandante, Olexandr Syrskyi.

O Estado-Maior Ucraniano informou no sábado que forças da Ucrânia repeliram 17 ataques na área, com 10 confrontos ainda em andamento.

""A situação é difícil, mas está sob controle das forças armadas"", diz o relatório.

O popular blog militar não oficial da Ucrânia, DeepState, não fez referência a Lozuvatske no último texto publicado, mas nos últimos dois dias relatou a queda de duas vilas no setor — Prohres e Vovche.",PT,['URW: Praise of Russia'],['URW: Praise of Russia: Praise of Russian military might'],Rússia assumir controlo povoação leste ucrânia ministério defesa Rússia anunciar sábado força russo tomar controlo povoação lozuvatske setor pokrovsk região donetsk ucrânia batalha acirrada linha frente guerra durar há estado-maior ucrânia mencionar povoação relatório apontar redor tomar combate pesar fonte militar oficial relatar perda localidade setor força russo avançar lentamente região donetsk leste ucrânia ganho constante incremental tomar cidade-chave avdiivka fevereiro ministério defesa russo dizer central força Rússia capturar lozuvatske noroeste Centro regional donetsk controlar russo Rússia afirmar força lançar ataque localidade setor repelir contra-ataque ucraniano autoridade ucraniano relatar haver várias semana setor pokrovsk tomar combate pesado longo linha frente quilómetro presidente volodymyr zelenskiy debater setor quinta-feira principal comandante olexandr syrskyi estado-maior ucraniano informar sábado força ucrânia repelir ataque confronto andamento situação difícil controle força armar relatório popular blog militar oficial ucrânia deepstate referência lozuvatske texto publicar último dia relatar queda vila setor prohr vovche

O ataque a um comboio de equipamento militar ucraniano na República Popular de Donetsk foi realizado com recurso a mísseis balísticos de curto alcance.

As guarnições dos sistemas de defesa aérea Patriot fornecidos à Ucrânia pelos EUA, anteriormente destruídos pelas forças russas, foram ""quase de certeza"" eliminadas, noticiou a revista Forbes.

O meio de comunicação social referiu que a ""persistência e a boa sorte"" de um operador russo de drones o ""recompensou no sábado (9), quando localizou um comboio ucraniano incluindo pelo menos dois lançadores quádruplos montados num camião para uma bateria de mísseis terra-ar Patriot"" na República Popular de Donetsk (RPD).

""Os ucranianos perderam nesse dia até 13% dos seus lançadores Patriot"", pelo que ""o ar sobre o Leste da Ucrânia pode ter ficado muito mais seguro para os russos"", segundo a Forbes.

O relato surge depois de uma fonte dos serviços de segurança ter dito à Sputnik que dois sistemas Patriot estavam entre o equipamento militar das tropas ucranianas destruído por um ataque do míssil balístico superfície-superfície russo Iskander na RPD.

Dados do Ministério da Defesa russo mostraram que o ataque também destruiu um sistema de mísseis S-300 das tropas ucranianas perto da cidade de Pokrovsky, na RPD.

A última vez que os militares russos atingiram um Patriot foi no final de fevereiro, quando o lançador, o trator, as munições e o veículo de transporte do sistema foram destruídos por armas de alta precisão.

Em maio de 2023, o Ministério da Defesa russo informou que as suas forças tinham destruído um Patriot estacionado em Kiev com um míssil hipersónico Kinzhal. O ministro da Defesa russo, Sergei Shoigu, anunciou um ataque bem-sucedido a outro Patriot duas semanas depois.

Os países ocidentais aumentaram os seus fornecimentos militares a Kiev logo após o início da operação militar especial da Rússia em 2022. Moscovo alertou repetidamente contra a continuação das entregas de armas a Kiev, dizendo que isso levaria a uma nova escalada do conflito.

O presidente da Nicarágua, Daniel Ortega, e a sua mulher, Rosario Murillo, lideraram, na sexta-feira (19), em Manágua, um evento artístico e político para celebrar o 45.º aniversário da revolução sandinista, que contou com a presença de enviados de Cuba, Rússia, Venezuela e outros países.

Milhares de pessoas vestidas de branco assistiram à cerimónia noturna de encerramento de uma semana de celebrações, que contou com encenação, música e dança.

O público agitava bandeiras brancas e azuis da Nicarágua, bem como vermelhas e pretas da Frente Sandinista de Libertação Nacional (FSLN), que depôs o ditador Anastasio Somoza, a 19 de julho de 1979.

""Somos livres e nunca mais seremos escravos. Nunca nos venderemos nem nos renderemos"", disse Murillo durante o evento, que contou com a presença de delegações oficiais de pelo menos 18 países. O Irão e a Coreia do Norte enviaram cartas de saudações.

""Cuba rejeita as medidas coercivas unilaterais impostas pelo imperialismo yankee (dos Estados Unidos) e pelos seus aliados contra a irmã Nicarágua"", afirmou o líder histórico da revolução cubana, Ramiro Valdés, de 92 anos.

O presidente da Duma Estatal (câmara baixa do Parlamento) da Rússia, Vyacheslav Volodin, leu uma mensagem de saudação na qual destacou os laços de amizade do presidente Vladimir Putin com a Nicarágua. Um enviado da Bielorrússia também falou.

A cerimónia, que durou mais de quatro horas, terminou com um discurso de Ortega, um antigo guerrilheiro, de 78 anos.

O presidente destacou os avanços na alfabetização e na reforma agrária do regime revolucionário no meio da luta contra os rebeldes ‘do contra’ apoiados pelos Estados Unidos na década de 1980.

""A União Soviética [...], sendo uma potência, não veio estabelecer-se aqui para tomar as riquezas da Nicarágua, mas para dar a mão ao povo nicaraguense para que se pudesse desenvolver"", disse Ortega, que criticou a Ucrânia, Israel e os Estados Unidos.

A celebração na Plaza de la Fe de Manágua decorreu no meio de críticas dos Estados Unidos, da União Europeia e de organizações internacionais pela mão pesada com que Ortega governou desde os violentos protestos de 2018, que fizeram mais de 300 mortos, centenas de detidos e milhares de exilados, segundo a ONU.

Ortega afirma que os protestos foram uma tentativa de golpe de Estado patrocinado por Washington.

Desde então, centenas de políticos, jornalistas, intelectuais, sacerdotes e activistas críticos do governo foram presos, perseguidos e expulsos do país e despojados da sua nacionalidade e propriedade.
